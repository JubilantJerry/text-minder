Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- (man) Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
- (cheering)
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
(knock at door)
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
(knocking)
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
(knocking)
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire(!
)
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
(doors swing open)
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us(!
)
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Ah, leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
(Hilario) Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
(bell ringing)
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces(!
)
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
(drumbeats)
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here(!
)
Oh, it's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
(cheering)
(firecrackers bang)
(high-pitched note)
Hilario!
(whispering)
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
(Britt) Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
(festivities continue)
(whispers)
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim squeeze cock.
Aim squeeze cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
¡Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
(twig snaps)
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel(!
)
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good. "
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
(gunshots)
They haven't gone, then.
(gunshots)
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
(gunshot)
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
(Chris) Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort(!
)
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It's because I'm I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men. "
"They are brutes.
They are cruel. "
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
... you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
(moaning)
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
(Harry) Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
(Flaco) As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
Oh...
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills past the men on guard right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that this will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time. "
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care. "
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
- I'll be damned!
- (kicking at door)
- Maybe you won't be.
- (window smashes)
(gunshots continue)
(gunshot)
(gunshot)
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
(gunshot)
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
(gasps in pain)
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
(gunshots)
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael... (sobs) Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again,... ..we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns,... ..we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- l'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,...
- ..but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. I would if I could, but...
- ..there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840. lt's the only one in the county.
- l'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- l'll pay for the damages.
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- (man) lnjun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- lt's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
- (cheering)
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- l'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
(knock at door)
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- lf you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away,... ..life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer,... ..but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin,... ..you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- l'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
(knocking)
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- l'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- l aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
(knocking)
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- l heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,...
- ..
I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- l'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste... I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store,... ..and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire(!
)
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- l still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- lf he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- l don't know. lt was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- l want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
(doors swing open)
You.
- l've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,... ..cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now,... ..and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey,... ..give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us(!
)
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Ah, leave him alone. lt's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
(Hilario) Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
(bell ringing)
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces(!
)
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
(drumbeats)
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here(!
)
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
(cheering)
(firecrackers bang)
(high-pitched note)
Hilario!
(whispering)
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
(Britt) Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
(festivities continue)
(whispers)
- l'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,... ..I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this,... ..what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
¡ Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
(twig snaps)
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- l'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel(!
)
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two,... ..three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- lt's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh...
- ..maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris,... ..what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... lf he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose l offer you equal shares?
- ln what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands,... ..everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
(gunshots)
They haven't gone, then.
(gunshots)
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
(gunshot)
- l make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
(Chris) Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- lt's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- lt's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. lt's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort(!
)
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't. lf you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh,... ..hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat,... ..mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It's because I'm... ..I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes... ..and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of,... ..of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... ..as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man,... ..that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh,... ..envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn't afraid of you. lt's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway,... ..before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- lt's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- lf you were Calvera,...
- Yes?
..you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
(moaning)
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait,... ..for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
(Harry) Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
(Flaco) As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
Oh... I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew,... ..but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- l didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- lt's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,...
- ..
I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills,... ..past the men on guard,... ..right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,... ..you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well,... ..you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others - l go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that...
..this...
..will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera,... ..maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you. I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway,... ..to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like... I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "lt seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun,... ..a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... ..is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... ..maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land,... ..raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- l guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm,... ..working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank. lt's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- l hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... ..men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. lt's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
- l'll be damned!
- (kicking at door)
- Maybe you won't be.
- (window smashes)
(gunshots continue)
(gunshot)
(gunshot)
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
(gunshot)
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
(gasps in pain)
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera,... ..the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind,... ..blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
(gunshots)
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael... (sobs) Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again,... ..we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns,... ..we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,...
- ..but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but...
- ..there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- (man) Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
- (cheering)
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
(knock at door)
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away,... ..life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer,... ..but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin,... ..you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
(knocking)
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
(knocking)
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,...
- ..
I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store,... ..and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire(!
)
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
(doors swing open)
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,... ..cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now,... ..and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
Hey,... ..give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us(!
)
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Ah, leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
(Hilario) Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
( bell ringing)
Who sounded the alarm?
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces(!
)
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
(drum beats)
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here(!
)
Oh, it's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
(cheering)
(firecrackers bang)
(high-pitched note)
Hilario!
(whispering)
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
(Britt) Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
(festivities continue)
(whispers)
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,... ..I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this,... ..what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
¡ Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
(twig snaps)
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel(!
)
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two,... ..three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
Me?
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh...
- ..maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris,... ..what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands,... ..everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
(gunshots)
They haven't gone, then.
(gunshots)
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
(gunshot)
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
(Chris) Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort(!
)
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh,... ..hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat,... ..mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It's because I'm... ..I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes... ..and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of,... ..of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... ..as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man,... ..that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh,... ..envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway,... ..before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera,...
- Yes?
..you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
(moaning)
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait,... ..for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
(Harry) Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
(Flaco) As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
Oh...
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew,... ..but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,...
- ..
I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills,... ..past the men on guard,... ..right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,... ..you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well,... ..you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that...
..this...
..will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera,... ..maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway,... ..to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun,... ..a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... ..is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... ..maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land,... ..raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm,... ..working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... ..men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
- I'll be damned!
- (kicking at door)
- Maybe you won't be.
- (window smashes)
(gunshots continue)
(gunshot)
(gunshot)
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
(gunshot)
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
(gasps in pain)
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera,... ..the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind,... ..blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can´t tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women´s fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
!
Mire!
Religion!
You´d weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I´m trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don´t see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I´ll be back.
Enough!
We´ll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
(gunshots)
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael... (sobs) Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It´s always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
!
Adiós!
Let´s go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again,... ..we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That´s what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That´s something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don´t think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don´t know.
We´ll ask the old man.
He´ll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns,... ..we know how to plant and grow - we don´t know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I´ve been waitin´ for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- l´m sorry, but there´ll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave´s dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,...
- ..but there´ll be no funeral.
- Didn´t l pay you enough?
It´s not a question of money.
For $20, I´d plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral´s off.
Well, how d´ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he´d second the motion.
- That´s as unanimous as you can get.
- You´ve behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I´m not lookin´ for any praise.
I´m a travelling salesman - ladies´ corsets.
I´m walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I´m doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He´s not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. I would if I could, but...
- ..there´s an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn´t fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There´s nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they´re past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I´ll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long´s this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It´s not my doin´, boys.
I don´t like it.
No, sir.
I´ve always treated every man as another future customer.
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin´.
- My driver´s quit.
- He´s prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin´ his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that´s all that´s holding things up, I´ll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You´re more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840. lt´s the only one in the county.
- l´ll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- l´ll pay for the damages.
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- (man) lnjun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We´ll get there.
- lt´s not gettin´ up there that bothers me.
It´s staying´ up there that I mind.
Comin´ up behind us on the left.
I don´t think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I´m not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don´t you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
- (cheering)
Hey!
Hey!
I´d like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin´?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You´re more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won´t forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin´!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y´know, she won´t believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- l´m drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting´.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that´s your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what´s your name?
Make it Vin.
- What´s yours?
- Chris.
(knock at door)
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There´s this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- lf you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can´t station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don´t you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I´m not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What´s that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I´ve been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away,... ..life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer,... ..but the children, they cry because they´re hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We´ll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don´t, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin,... ..you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We´ve considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- l´ll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait. I didn´t say I´ll go.
I´ll pass the word around that you´re looking for men.
It won´t be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That´s expected.
But good men?
That´s something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
(knocking)
Come in.
The word is out you´re looking for men.
That´s right.
Men who are good with that.
- l´m good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- l aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
(knocking)
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It´s good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- l heard you´ve got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It´s just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don´t talk so good, but you always know what´s goin´ on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that´s on top.
What´s underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don´t understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I´m in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,...
- ..
I´d like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There´s one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin´ up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- l´d like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I´m gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I´m gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that´s your taste... I heard of a job shooing´ some flies away from a village, but I don´t know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that´s ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I´m looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn´t even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store,... ..and it´s good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O´Reilly.
Don´t know his name, but there´s a fella in back chopping´ wood for his breakfast.
Mornin´.
I´m a friend of Harry Luck´s.
He tells me you´re broke.
Nah, I´m doing this because I´m an eccentric millionaire(!
)
There´s a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big´s the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That´s right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that´s a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- l still say he can´t.
- And I tell you he can.
- lf he claims that, he´s a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don´t give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months´ salary comin´.
I´ll bet it all it ain´t so.
- Well, you ain´t betting´ with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I´m talkin´ to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you´re wrong.
What d´you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What´s the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I´m wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- l don´t know. lt was mighty close.
Close?
What d´you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell ´em. I won, didn´t l?
You lost.
You´re a liar.
I said you´re a liar!
I said you´re a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let´s do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I´ll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- l want nothin´ to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn´t want any better.
Wasn´t interested.
The money?
It wasn´t enough?
He doesn´t care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn´t care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he´s the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
(doors swing open)
You.
- l´ve been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let´s see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,... ..cos he´d be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids´ game!
- Hey, kid, that´s enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now,... ..and let´s see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don´t think I mean it, huh?
You... think I´m just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey,... ..give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There´s a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That´s right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I´ll have the money before I leave.
It´ll just take care of my last two days´ rent.
$20?
You must be livin´ in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you´re on the run.
There´s a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He´s a good gun.
And we aren´t heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won´t take no for an answer.
- Doesn´t show much sense, does he?
I´m getting a stiff neck keeping´ track of him.
If you can´t forget him, why don´t you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won´t last much longer.
That so?
Ridin´ out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us(!
)
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn´t food he´s hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he´s like an itch I can´t scratch.
Ah, leave him alone. lt´s a free country.
And it´s his.
You know, it´s funny.
Now that he´s gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
(Hilario) Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he´s afraid she may starve.
There´s no need to apologise.
We didn´t expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
(bell ringing)
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces(!
)
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We´re ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it´s a different story when you´re in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we´re here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you´re worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We´ll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we´re seven.
(drumbeats)
You know, I´ve been in some towns where the girls aren´t very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I´ve been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I´ve been in a town where there´s no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we´re not careful, we can have quite a social life here(!
)
Oh, it´s not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting´ the weather for today and didn´t break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
(cheering)
(firecrackers bang)
(high-pitched note)
Hilario!
(whispering)
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera´s men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
(Britt) Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I´ll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
(festivities continue)
(whispers)
- l´m sorry, Britt. I didn´t mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I´ve ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It´s almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
!
Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He´d never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,... ..I promise you, we´ll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don´t, two things will happen.
One: you´ll waste a bullet.
Two: you´ll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you´re gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You´ll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera´s men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this,... ..what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Seòor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, seòor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
You do anything to me and I´ll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I´ll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- l´ll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that´s where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won´t tell where.
They´re afraid.
She´s afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we´d rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn´t you bring ´em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He´ll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma´am.
Come on, little angel(!
)
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can´t tell you how wonderful it was for you seòoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How´s the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there´s tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that´s all.
- Thank you.
- You´re welcome.
- Thank you.
- You´re welcome.
- Thank you.
- You´re welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You´re welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two,... ..three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn´t l tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you´re milking a goat, Miguel.
- lt´s that I get excited.
- Well, don´t get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I´ll tell you what.
Don´t shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We´ve come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can´t protect you out here.
Rojas is makin´ room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh...
- ..maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I´ve never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don´t worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It´s like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they´ll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris,... ..what about that net, eh?
Well, if he´s not looking for it... lf he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn´t come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won´t keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We´re trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn´t afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won´t give us too much trouble.
There won´t be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I´m going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don´t think you´ve solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn´t our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We´re in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose l offer you equal shares?
- ln what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn´t want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands,... ..everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won´t come back.
- Why not?
You won´t have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they´ll get another!
- We´ll tear them to pieces.
- We´ll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of ´em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he´ll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He´ll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don´t sting the way we do.
Seòor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
(gunshots)
They haven´t gone, then.
(gunshots)
- See the gun flashing´?
- No.
(gunshot)
- l make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid´s gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O´Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They´re too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I´ll cover you.
(Chris) Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What´s the matter?
Don´t you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- lt´s not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- lt´s our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we´re not afraid.
- He´s very brave. lt´s the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d´you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there´s always fresh flowers on your grave.
That´s a mighty big comfort(!
)
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don´t you kids be too disappointed if your plans don´t work out.
We won´t. lf you stay alive, we´ll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh,... ..hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin´ now.
Funny...
Hands sweat,... ..mouth is dry.
You´d think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It´s because I´m... ..I´m frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you´d given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes... ..and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of,... ..of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... ..as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man,... ..that´s a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh,... ..envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn´t do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn´t take foolish chances.
All right, I won´t.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I´m sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn´t afraid of you. lt´s my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He´s right.
Do you know that?
He´s right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway,... ..before he finds out you´re here.
He already knows.
He said he´d punish me for being so shameless.
But I don´t care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they´ll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we´re still out there ready to jump them.
He didn´t go.
Calvera didn´t go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- lt´s Calvera´s move.
- Right.
Now you´d better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- lf you were Calvera,...
- Yes?
..you´d go away, wouldn´t you?
If you´d paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I´m not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass ´em out.
Now, let´s get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They´ll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They´ll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it´s worth it?
- Don´t you?
It´s only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn´t that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn´t that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of ´em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don´t you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I´ll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That´s three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That´s four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That´s nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That´s... 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They´re all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There´s still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
(moaning)
Please, no!
It´s all right.
You´re all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Seòor, don´t punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait,... ..for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Seòor, don´t.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you´re with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin´ here to hide.
The deserter... hiding´ out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we´re asleep, and then we´ll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You´re too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O´Reilly!
You´ve been adopted.
Yeah, it´s my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That´s very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn´t have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can´t find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that´s very true.
- There´s no denyin´ it.
(Harry) Well, then!
No!
When you´re finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
(Flaco) As you say, seòor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn´t tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can´t you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That´s exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I´d be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin´ around here?
Calvera...
We´ve seen the end of him.
He´ll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won´t go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn´t worried about food for winter.
He´s worried about the food his men haven´t eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They´re starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
Oh... I´ve been up there.
Well, we´d better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won´t win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We´re surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there´s no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don´t care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we´ll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it´s too late.
is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who´s for going on and who´s for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don´t be fools!
You´ll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It´s the only thing for them to do.
I´ll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I´ll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we´re gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I´m not sayin´ we bit off more than we can chew,... ..but we oughta talk about what we´re gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We´re the only game in town.
- A man can´t call ´em all.
- l didn´t say he could.
All I´m saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D´you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- lt´s not the kind courts enforce.
- That´s just the kind you´ve gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,...
- ..
I don´t know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills,... ..past the men on guard,... ..right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,... ..you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They´re not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well,... ..you´d better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who´d live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I´m saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others - l go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that...
..this...
..will get you nothing but this.
We´re going to hit Calvera,... ..maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he´ll be on foot.
I´ll go with you. I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You´re in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They´ve left to hit the village.
- No.
We´d have heard shots.
They´ve gone.
Good evening.
You´ll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that´s what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let´s talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You´re wondering how.
Your friends, they don´t like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway,... ..to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don´t disagree.
- Anyway, I don´t want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like... I´ll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won´t use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don´t understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "lt seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun,... ..a fella told me "Vin, you can´t afford to care."
There´s your problem.
One thing I don´t need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that´s your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... ..is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... ..maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land,... ..raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn´t work against me.
I, uh... just didn´t want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don´t you?
- l guess so.
- You´re one of us, aren´t you?
- Yeah, I´m one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We´re ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don´t ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm,... ..working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That´s why I never even started anything like that.
That´s why I never will.
You´ll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank. lt´s clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
!
Adiós!
!
Adiós!
I could have told you they´d sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin´.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate ´em.
- l hate ´em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I´m one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... ..men like you.
And now me.
So what d´you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin´ on white sheets.
I think I´ll ride back to that village.
You´re crazy, all of ya!
They won´t lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody´s asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. lt´s all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let ´em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don´t owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You´re crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
Hold on, Chris, I´ll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I´d hate to die a sucker.
We didn´t come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn´t there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
- l´ll be damned!
- (kicking at door)
- Maybe you won´t be.
- (window smashes)
(gunshots continue)
(gunshot)
(gunshot)
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
(gunshot)
We didn´t...
We didn´t mean to do it.
We didn´t mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
(gasps in pain)
What´s my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You´re damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn´t be sorry to have you stay.
- They won´t be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they´d show it more.
We didn´t get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera,... ..the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind,... ..blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey, give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera,
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan...
a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here...
little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
I know you have your problems...
Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael...
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again... we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
Live somewhere else?
Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
He leaves us enough to go on with.
That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
We must do something!
We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
Buy guns.
Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns... we know how to plant and grow We don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him... but there'll be no funeral.
Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
That's as unanimous as you can get.
You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a traveling salesman...
ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
Come on, Henry...
No!
This man has to be buried.
Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
I know.
I would if I could, but... there's an element in town that objects.
Objects?
To what?
They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
How long's this been going on?
Since the town got civilized.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
My driver's quit.
He's prejudiced too?
If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
Well, get somebody else.
Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
I'll pay for the damages.
I wanna see this.
Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
New in town?
Yeah.
Where are you from?
Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
Tombstone?
Same.
People all settled down, like.
Same all over.
Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
We'll get there.
It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
You elected?
No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now...
save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
Boys, the drinks are on me!
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
Thanks for the free show.
You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
Henry, the stage is leavin'!
All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
Where are you headed?
I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
Any action here?
Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
What's yours?
Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
Thank you very much.
We wish you to help us.
There's this man, Calvera.
A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
Not only that, but our women...
Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
If you need protection, go to the rurales.
We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again...
Calvera...and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
We need help.
We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
Why don't you hire men?
Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
Will you go?
It will be a blessing if you help us.
Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
No, no.
We offer more than that.
We could feed you every day.
And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away... life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer... but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin... you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing...until the reason for it has gone.
We understand.
We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
I'll see what I can do for you.
Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure... same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
I'm good with it.
Fast?
Try me.
I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and...
and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
No tricks now, Chris.
Harry!
It's good to see you again.
Chris.
What are you doing in this dump?
I heard you've got a contract open.
Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
Only what I told you.
Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
Only what I told you.
Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps...
I'd like to buy him a drink.
Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
Vin.
Howdy.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Whiskey.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
A week?
Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
You heard of anything?
Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store... and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
You cost a lot.
Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
Where can I reach you?
Right here.
I still say he can't.
And I tell you he can.
If he claims that, he's a liar.
Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
Well, you ain't betting' with me.
Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
Well, one of us is a fathead.
You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
Filene, how about it?
I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
Call it!
I want nothin' to do with this.
Call it!
Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
Britt.
Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
I've been looking for you!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him... cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now... and let's see how fast you are.
And no games?
No clapping hands...none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
Campesino.
Come on!
You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it?
You... think I'm just talking?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey... give him my gun.
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
That's right.
How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
How much does the job pay?
20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
Any idea who it is?
Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
Won't take no for an answer.
Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat...what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
How about I bring him some?
It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
Where are they, Tomas?
Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter...
too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologize.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating...then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger.
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here
Oh, it's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
Get one alive.
Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else... surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him...
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim... squeeze... cock.
Aim... squeeze... cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
You'll get more guns.
How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this... what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
What gold mine, señor?
You know, the one in the mountains.
In our mountains?
We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
Whatever happened to it?
We have no silver mine either.
I mean in the old days.
Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk.
Toro.
Toro.
¡Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
You almost took my eye out!
Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
Where are the others?
I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
Who is she?
From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
How's the food?
Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
No, sir.
Many thanks.
You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two... three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
It's that I get excited.
Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well... maybe somebody else?
They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertilizer and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertilizer.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
Awful lot of new walls.
Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris... what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
How many of you did they hire?
Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble If you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business.
Only as competitors.
Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
In what?
Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
What do you say?
Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands... everybody in this village will answer to me...when I come back!
You won't come back.
Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
The last time you told it, it was five!
They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
They got a good kick in the behind.
If they try it again, they'll get another!
We'll tear them to pieces.
We'll bury them all.
Calvera too!
Any sign of 'em?
No.
That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
I would never have guessed it.
Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages... other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbors...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
See the gun flashing'?
No.
I make it two of them.
Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
Three?
Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
So might you.
It's not the same thing.
This is my work.
It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
But we're not afraid.
He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your... hands sweat before a fight?
Every time.
Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat... mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera?
Yes... and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of... of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man... that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever...
felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I... envy you.
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't do things like you did.
Go back.
You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
Does it hurt?
What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
You know what I thought.
Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway... before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
Result.
Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
What do we do now?
Well, what do you say?
Me?
We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
It's Calvera's move.
Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
Yes, I would, only...
Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
How do I look?
Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
Do you think it's worth it?
Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
Mm?
Well, isn't that true?
Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
None.
Prospects: zero.
Suppose I left anything out?
Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
None.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
Armando in the plaza.
That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait... for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
Señor, don't.
And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
Alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
But you're with friends now.
Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
Comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
All right, Bernardo?
Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
Think you can do it?
Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
You know we have no money.
It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
Where in the mountains?
That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this...how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
He won't go anywhere.
Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
They're starving.
How do you know?
Starving and broke.
How do you know?
!
Oh...
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
Because they gotta die or win.
Válgame Dios if they do win.
They won't win.
Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
Once you start, there's no stopping.
You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
Let Calvera have the food.
Give him what he wants.
At least we'll be alive.
Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew... but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
We figured wrong.
We're the only game in town.
A man can't call 'em all.
I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
It's not the kind courts enforce.
That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now...
I don't know.
The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills... past the men on guard... right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news... you should have seen the look I got from Britt...and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well... you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer...a peasant?
You know what I'm saying?
Wherever they go Chris, Vin, Britt, the others...
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that... this... will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera... maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
They've left to hit the village.
No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway... to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
Ride on.
Just like that?
Mm, just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
I wonder myself.
No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun... a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land... raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
Can we go with you, Bernardo?
No.
You like us, don't you?
I guess so.
You're one of us, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
Take us with you!
Please?
!
No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm... working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it... this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adios!
¡Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honor, no loyalty...nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
I hate 'em all.
Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
Chris...
Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
Sacks of it.
Oh... sounds beautiful!
How much?
At least a half a million.
My cut woulda been what?
About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
Bernardo!
Bernardo!
No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
Bernardo.
Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain forever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera... the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind... blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
Hey, give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
Me?
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera,
- Yes?
you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
(gunshots)
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael... (sobs) Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again,... ..we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns,... ..we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- l'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,...
- ..but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. I would if I could, but...
- ..there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840. lt's the only one in the county.
- l'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- l'll pay for the damages.
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- (man) lnjun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- lt's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
- (cheering)
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- l'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
(knock at door)
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- lf you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away,... ..life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer,... ..but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin,... ..you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- l'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
(knocking)
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- l'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- l aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
(knocking)
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- l heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,...
- ..
I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- l'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste... I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store,... ..and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire(!
)
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- l still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- lf he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- l don't know. lt was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- l want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
(doors swing open)
You.
- l've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,... ..cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now,... ..and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey,... ..give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us(!
)
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Ah, leave him alone. lt's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
(Hilario) Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
(bell ringing)
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces(!
)
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
(drumbeats)
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here(!
)
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
(cheering)
(firecrackers bang)
(high-pitched note)
Hilario!
(whispering)
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
(Britt) Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
(festivities continue)
(whispers)
- l'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,... ..I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Aim,... ..squeeze,... ..cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this,... ..what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
¡ Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
(twig snaps)
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- l'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel(!
)
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two,... ..three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- lt's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh...
- ..maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris,... ..what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... lf he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose l offer you equal shares?
- ln what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands,... ..everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
(gunshots)
They haven't gone, then.
(gunshots)
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
(gunshot)
- l make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
(Chris) Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- lt's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- lt's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. lt's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort(!
)
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't. lf you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh,... ..hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat,... ..mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It's because I'm... ..I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes... ..and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of,... ..of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... ..as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man,... ..that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh,... ..envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn't afraid of you. lt's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway,... ..before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- lt's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- lf you were Calvera,...
- Yes?
..you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
(moaning)
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait,... ..for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
(Harry) Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
(Flaco) As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
Oh... I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew,... ..but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- l didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- lt's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,...
- ..
I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills,... ..past the men on guard,... ..right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,... ..you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well,... ..you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others - l go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that...
..this...
..will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera,... ..maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you. I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway,... ..to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like... I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "lt seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun,... ..a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... ..is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... ..maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land,... ..raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- l guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm,... ..working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank. lt's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- l hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... ..men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. lt's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
- l'll be damned!
- (kicking at door)
- Maybe you won't be.
- (window smashes)
(gunshots continue)
(gunshot)
(gunshot)
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
(gunshot)
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
(gasps in pain)
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera,... ..the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind,... ..blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again
- Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Valgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks:
The whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey, give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asuncion!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
Valgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One:
You'll waste a bullet.
Two:
You'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Senor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, senor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you senoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you:
Sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Senor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera,
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home:
None.
Wife:
None.
Kids:
None.
Prospects:
Zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to:
None.
People with a hold on you:
None.
Men you step aside for:
None.
Insults swallowed:
None.
Enemies:
None.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andres, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
Jose near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Senor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Senor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
Alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
Comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, senor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Valgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go
- Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question:
Why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
Adios!
Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael...
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
Boys, the drinks are on me!
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Ah, leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here
Oh, it's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim squeeze cock.
Aim squeeze cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
¡Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good. "
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It's because I'm I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men. "
"They are brutes.
They are cruel. "
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
...you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
Oh...
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills past the men on guard right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that this will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time. "
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care. "
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here
- little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman
- ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
ln Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away,
life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey, give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Seòor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, seòor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you seòoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Seòor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera,
- Yes?
you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Seòor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Seòor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, seòor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in EI Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
Adiós!
Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey, give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera,
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
Here!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a good father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something...
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn... or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, friend, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and... the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- What's matter.
Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead right in front of me.
For two hours people kept stepped over around him, without lifting a finger.
I'm just doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry, let's get on...
- No!
Wait a minute.
This man has to be buried.
- And soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but... there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing up there but murderers, cutthroats and derelict old barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, brother, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840 in Denver.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
You know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see you.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
Hey, you old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Valgame Dios.
There's one!
Look at all the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I did hear of a job below the border shooing flies away from a village, but I can't find out what it pays.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks.
The whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Below the border shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- Nah, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for a man named O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up in less than a month.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to you!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
because he respects him... 'cause he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damn kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now... and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey, you... give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asuncion!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many pigs, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride for days to get to this nothing in the middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide.
From us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns...
where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
Valgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze,
Cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One:
You'll waste a bullet.
Two:
You'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Senior, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, senior?
- You know... the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks pretty good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, senior.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well... maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good".
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris... what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... if he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother.
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you - sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe behind your rock by the net.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming like devil.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages... other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Senior!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
Nah.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we take your rifle and avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort.
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your... hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat... mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess right about now you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes... and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of... of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... as I saw him run away - from us.
Man... that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I... envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men".
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway... before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
You would go...
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass them out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing that happened.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while, you can call bartenders and Faro dealers by their first names.
Maybe 200 of them.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home, none.
Wife, none.
Kids... none.
Prospects, zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to, none.
People with a hold on you, none.
Men you step aside for, none.
Insults swallowed... none.
Enemies,.. none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andres, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
Jose near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
Have no fear?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Senior, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait... for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Senior, don't.
- And the lies you tell to fool yourself.
No enemies... alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
Comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away...
buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, senior, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some around here?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Valgame Dios... if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With... or without you.
I'm not saying we bit off more than we can chew, but we ought to talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
where we figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
Do you wanna go?
There comes a time to turn Mother's picture to the wall and get out!
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well... you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in... a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go...
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others...
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I... want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that... this... will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway... to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso, one day he took all his clothes off and jumped in a mess of cactus.
I asked him the same question "Why?"
And?
He said It seemed to be a good idea at the time.
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me Vin, you can't afford to care.
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me... wouldn't work against me.
I... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
Adios!
Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothing.
All they care about is their...
precious crops and the miserable... dirt they dig in.
I hate them.
- I hate them all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are, hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... men like you.
And now me.
So what do you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of you!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let them.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of you!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers, did we?
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain forever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
¡Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems....
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael...
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adiós!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
- Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
Boys, the drinks are on me!
Hey!
Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say, uh... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Ah, leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunción!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
Ah... but it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here
Oh, it's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
Oh...
That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim squeeze cock.
Aim squeeze cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
¡Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well, uh maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good. "
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
Yeh-hey!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No...
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your, uh hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
Mm-mm.
It's because I'm I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I, uh envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men. "
"They are brutes.
They are cruel. "
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
...you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
Mm?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you, uh... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
Oh...
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills past the men on guard right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that this will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Mm, just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time. "
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care. "
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adiós!
¡Adiós!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Ya!
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Adiós.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
#Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
#Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- l'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840. lt's the only one in the county.
- l'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- l'll pay for the damages.
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- lnjun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- lt's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- l'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- lf you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- l'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- l'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- l aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- l heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- l'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Valgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- l'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste... I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- l still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- lf he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- l don't know. lt was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- l want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- l've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey,
give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- lt isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone. lt's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asuncion!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- l'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
#Valgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him, I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Senor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, senor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- l'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you senoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- lt's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... lf he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose l offer you equal shares?
- ln what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Senor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- l make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- lt's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- lt's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. lt's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't. lf you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm... I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn't afraid of you. lt's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- lt's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- lf you were Calvera,
- Yes?
you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Senor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Senor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, senor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Valgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- l didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- lt's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- l don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others - l go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you. I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like... I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "lt seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- l guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank. lt's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
#Adios!
#Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- l hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. lt's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
#Mire!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
#Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- l'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840. lt's the only one in the county.
- l'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- l'll pay for the damages.
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- lnjun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- lt's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- l'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- lf you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- l'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- l'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- l aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- l heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- l'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Valgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- l'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste... I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- l still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- lf he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- l don't know. lt was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- l want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- l've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey,
give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- lt isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone. lt's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asuncion!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- l'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
#Valgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him, I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Senor, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, senor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- l'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you senoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- lt's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... lf he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose l offer you equal shares?
- ln what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Senor!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- l make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- lt's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- lt's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. lt's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't. lf you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm... I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn't afraid of you. lt's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- lt's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- lf you were Calvera,
- Yes?
you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
Prospects: zero.
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Senor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Senor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, senor, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Valgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- l didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- lt's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- l don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others - l go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you. I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like... I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "lt seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- l guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank. lt's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
#Adios!
#Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- l hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. lt's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
people no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
�Adi�s!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- l'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry...
- No!
This man has to be buried.
- Soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. I would if I could, but
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840. lt's the only one in the county.
- l'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- l'll pay for the damages.
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same. people all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- lnjun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- lt's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- l'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see ya.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- lf you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- l'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- l'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- l aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- l heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I'm in.
You dirty dog!
place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- l'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
V�lgame Dios.
There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- l'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste... I heard of a job shooing' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- l still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- lf he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- l don't know. lt was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- l want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- l've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him cos he respects him, cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now, and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey,
give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- lt isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone. lt's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asunci�n!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- l'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
�V�lgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him, I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Se�or, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, se�or?
- You know, the one in the mountains.
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- l'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you se�oritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, sir.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- lt's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well,
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris, what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... lf he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I.
We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose l offer you equal shares?
- ln what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you: sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages - other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Se�or!
Neighbours, I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing'?
- No.
- l make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
No.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- lt's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- lt's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. lt's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort!
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't. lf you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat, mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my talking annoy you?
It's because I'm... I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of, of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn't afraid of you. lt's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well, go home anyway, before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but wait?
- lt's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- lf you were Calvera,
- Yes?
you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have. lsn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1 ,000.
Home: none.
Wife: none.
Kids:
none.
prospects: zero.
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.
places you are tied down to: none.
people with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
none.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andr�s, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
Jos� near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 1 1 .
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Se�or, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait, for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Se�or, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, se�or, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- V�lgame Dios if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew, but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- l didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze, or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out.
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- lt's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- l don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go - Chris, Vin, Britt, the others - l go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that
this
will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you. I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway, to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like... I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "lt seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- l guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank. lt's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
�Adi�s!
�Adi�s!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
- l hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are?
Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. lt's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of ya!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain for ever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adi�s.
Adi�s.
Adi�s.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero!
My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions?
Shameless.
Cigar.
Here!
Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan - a rich town.
Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here - little church, priest comes twice a year.
Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load, huh?
The need to provide food, like a good father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns.
Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.
No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer!
Thief!
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us?
Our farms?
We could hide some food.
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no.
That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
- We must do something!
- We must do something...
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight.
Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?
!
- Buy guns.
- Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns, we know how to plant and grow - we don't know how to kill.
Then learn... or die.
Hey!
I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
- I'm sorry, friend, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?
!
The grave's dug, and... the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him,
- but there'll be no funeral.
- What's matter.
Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money.
For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?
!
I want him buried.
You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look.
I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead right in front of me.
For two hours people kept stepped over around him, without lifting a finger.
I'm just doing what any decent man would.
- Come on, Henry, let's get on...
- No!
Wait a minute.
This man has to be buried.
- And soon.
He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know.
I would if I could, but... there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects?
To what?
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What?
In Boot Hill?
There's nothing up there but murderers, cutthroats and derelict old barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, brother, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it.
No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell!
If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey!
Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840 in Denver.
It's the only one in the county.
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
- New in town?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.
You?
Tombstone.
See any action up there?
- Tombstone?
- Same.
People all settled down, like.
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!
Easy.
Just wind.
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
- You elected?
- No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon, huh?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Boys, the drinks are on me!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah.
Where are you goin'?
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this.
You know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry!
The stage!
Come on!
You keep this.
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just drifting'.
- Any action here?
- Yeah.
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well, see you.
Say, what's your name?
Make it Vin.
- What's yours?
- Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief.
A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait.
Just a minute.
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did.
Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again - Calvera - and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no.
We offer more than that.
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away, life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer, but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin, you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing - until the reason for it has gone.
- We understand.
- We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias.
You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men?
That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right.
Men who are good with that.
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?
- Try me.
- I aim to.
Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry!
It's good to see you again.
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
Hey, you old Cajun!
You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right.
All that's on top.
What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.
- Gold?
Cattle?
Payroll?
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind.
I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again.
Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,
- I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!
Valgame Dios.
There's one!
Look at all the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey, you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
- Vin.
- Howdy.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I did hear of a job below the border shooing flies away from a village, but I can't find out what it pays.
$20.
- A week?
- Six weeks.
The whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.
Below the border shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
- Nah, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.
We understand.
You could get much more in a grocery store, and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for a man named O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back chopping' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.
He said you got that Salinas thing cleared up in less than a month.
They paid me $800 for that one.
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
$20?
Right now, that's a lot.
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud.
He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
- Well, you ain't betting' with me.
- Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.
Britt.
Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to you!
Look at me!
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong.
What d'you say?
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?
!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close?
What d'you mean, close?
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened.
I won!
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up.
Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
- Britt.
- Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money?
It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?
!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
- I've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him...
because he respects him... 'cause he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damn kids' game!
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now... and let's see how fast you are.
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on.
Come on, draw!
- Campesino.
Come on!
- You say campesino to me?
!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it, huh?
You... think I'm just talking, huh?
Hey, get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?
!
Hey, you... give him my gun, huh?
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
- That's right.
- How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
- How much does the job pay?
- 20.
We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20?
You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah.
He picked us up at dawn.
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah.
That kid from the saloon.
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keeping' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!
Yeah.
Not smart like us!
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
- How about I bring him some?
- It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis!
Asuncion!
Demetrio!
Emilio!
Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?
Come out!
Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?
!
Come in.
You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter - too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many pigs, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating - then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces!
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride for days to get to this nothing in the middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide.
From us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger, huh?
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Huh?
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work.
Go on!
Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back!
All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns...
where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here!
It's not so bad.
I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predicting' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
- Get one alive.
- Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
- I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!
That was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
Valgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him,
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim, squeeze,
Cock.
Aim, squeeze, cock.
Settle down.
Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One:
You'll waste a bullet.
Two:
You'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
- You'll get more guns.
- How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this, what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Senior, not a fox.
A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
- What gold mine, senior?
- You know... the one in the mountains.
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver, hm?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?
Toro.
Toro.
Toro.
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go.
Let me go!
You bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up.
Shut up!
- Where are the others?
Huh?
- I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
- Who is she?
- From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.
Farmers!
Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for?
Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel!
Gently boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
- How's the food?
- Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice.
Looks pretty good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
- No, senior.
Many thanks.
- You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze?
Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right, squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club.
All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
- Move into the village?
!
Me?
!
- Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?
!
His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well... maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertiliser and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertiliser.
As for women, I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right.
Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good".
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris... what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it... if he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother.
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed.
When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four?
They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble - if you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
- In what?
- Everything.
To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
- What do you say?
- Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands, everybody in this village will answer to me - when I come back!
- You won't come back.
- Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you - sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe behind your rock by the net.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming like devil.
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!
Ten.
Ten!
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?
!
Any sign of 'em?
- No.
- That is bad luck.
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages... other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Senior!
Neighbours...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
- See the gun flashing?
- No.
- I make it two of them.
- Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico!
Stay put.
- Three?
- Three.
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?
Nah.
They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico, cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back!
Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down.
Now stay down!
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide!
Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we take your rifle and avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort.
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your... hands sweat before a fight?
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat... mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah.
I guess right about now you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?
Yes... and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of... of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... as I saw him run away - from us.
Man... that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I... envy you.
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes.
I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men".
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right.
Do you know that?
He's right.
Well, go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway... before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
You would go...
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass them out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
- How do I look?
Huh?
- Big improvement.
You know what?
They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing that happened.
They sing them for years.
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey, how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure.
Everything.
After a while, you can call bartenders and Faro dealers by their first names.
Maybe 200 of them.
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home, none.
Wife, none.
Kids... none.
Prospects, zero.
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.
Places you are tied down to, none.
People with a hold on you, none.
Men you step aside for, none.
Insults swallowed... none.
Enemies,.. none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well!
This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andres, Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.
That's three.
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
Jose near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk!
Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
Have no fear?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Senior, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait... for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
- Senior, don't.
- And the lies you tell to fool yourself.
No enemies... alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
Comin' here to hide.
The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young.
Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See?
All three, right side up.
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.
That's very easy.
Would you care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away...
buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?
!
Yeah.
They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No!
When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, senior, in the mountains.
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.
There!
I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait.
You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure.
Have you found some around here?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera...
We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
- They're starving.
- How do you know?
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?
!
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Valgame Dios... if they do win.
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away.
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet!
And listen to me!
No!
It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go.
Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
With... or without you.
I'm not saying we bit off more than we can chew, but we ought to talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
where we figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
Do you wanna go?
There comes a time to turn Mother's picture to the wall and get out!
The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now,
- I don't know.
- The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills, past the men on guard, right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We, you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news, you should have seen the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily.
Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well... you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in... a place like this?
Hm?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer - a peasant?
You know what I'm saying, huh?
Wherever they go...
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others...
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I... want you to understand that.
I want you to understand that... this... will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera, maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead.
All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now, uh?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me, only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway... to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well, you don't disagree.
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?
Practical.
They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.
I pardon you.
- Ride on.
- Just like that?
Just like...
I'll make it easy for you.
You want food?
Give them food.
Water?
All right.
Water.
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture, huh?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place.
Hm?
Why?
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso, one day he took all his clothes off and jumped in a mess of cactus.
I asked him the same question "Why?"
And?
He said It seemed to be a good idea at the time.
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun, a fella told me Vin, you can't afford to care.
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here, I started thinking... maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land, raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me... wouldn't work against me.
I... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
- Take us with you!
Please?
!
- No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm, working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it - this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army.
A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
Adios!
Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honour, no loyalty - nothing.
All they care about is their...
precious crops and the miserable... dirt they dig in.
I hate them.
- I hate them all.
- Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are, hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... men like you.
And now me.
So what do you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run.
Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of you!
They won't lift a finger to help.
Think of the odds.
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed?
Let them.
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
You're crazy!
All of you!
Come on.
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers, did we?
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!
- How much?
- At least a half a million.
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?
!
Why?
- Bernardo!
Bernardo!
- No.
No, get back.
Go on!
Get back.
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes.
The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain forever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera, the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.
Say, that stuff ain't half bad.
What's his price?
I'll buy the recipe to take back to the cook at the palmer house.
Daddy owns the palmer house.
I've got a job for you.
You ever hear of a man named celine?
Well, suppose you stop being so mysterious.
Just who is celine?
Now, you take my business empire.
It's like a house of cards.
You move a bottom one, the whole thing comes down.
Celine owns that card and my whole life.
He can't make a nickel outta that piece of paper.
But he'll hang on to it till he sees me ruined.
Till he sees me grovel and whine and beg.
Why don't you beg?
What's the money for if I can't hire you to do it?
You beg celine to sign this piece of paper.
You were going to show me the sights of san francisco,
Mr. Paladin.
He ain't gonna take the job.
And the sights of san francisco
Were not included in the deal.
I'm very sorry.
You don't like me.
Well, you ain't met celine.
He didn't take the money, sutton.
What about the woman?
She went up to his room.
Good.
You.
The man who just passed.
The one in the elegant shirt.
Who is he?
You find out, sutton.
I don't want to be surprised.
It's just a thousand for his fee.
Please, edward.
Trust me?
This your earring?
It was in my mailbox.
A little piece of the broken past.
Still, it was lovely while it lasted.
Everyone came to my salon.
Even the emperor maximilian.
In mexico.
Yes.
Now it seems like a dream of rain in the desert.
The mirror cracks, the music ends.
The revolution.
Have you ever heard of a colonel celine?
I see you have.
He was aid to maximilian.
It was thought that he was executed.
But now he's been seen alive.
Now, let me guess.
Colonel celine knows the whereabouts
Of a missing fortune.
No, no.
The...
The winged lion of cortez.
It's carved out of a single piece of black diamond.
Really, perhaps we should be more careful.
We should watch outside.
Would you do that?
There is no winged lion.
But for edward, it's different.
He needs to believe in fairy tales and lost treasures.
Mr. Paladin, I need you.
Will you believe me if I lay the truth nakedly before you?
How will I recognize it?
My eyes.
I am dying.
A month.
Perhaps a year.
My life has been...
Well, you read it in a glance.
No, please.
Look.
This is colonel celine.
He was my husband.
Very impressive.
I was young when we married.
Still with the scent of the provinces about me.
He was a very cold man.
Some would say ruthless.
But I was ruthless, too.
I deceived him, made him into a man to be laughed at.
And then the revolution came
And shattered our little glass world.
The streets were like an asylum,
But I ran through them trying to find my husband.
He'd been swept away.
Executed, I thought.
Until now.
Perhaps I was praying without even knowing.
Don't you see?
It must be a miracle.
But now, when there's so little time,
I can never find him without someone.
Without you.
I'm terribly s- no.
You mustn't say it.
It is better that we go separately.
Las cruces, and then the trail to the border.
We can meet there.
But there are people who choose to believe in lost treasures.
So, when you come, you will be careful.
If I come.
You will come.
And somehow...
I will repay you.
Men pretend play trick-track.
They ask about you.
You fool.
I thought that boy spoke no english.
Then why'd you ask him who that fella was?
Mr. Carter still in the hotel?
The man with the railroads and the daughter?
Oh, yes.
He say he wait for word from you.
Well, tell him I've decided to join the search for celine.
Sometimes you throw on black and it comes up red.
Enough, sutton.
He will be reasonable.
My name is schermer.
Your name is paladin.
Gunfighter.
Deadly.
Gentleman.
Please sit.
Where is celine?
I don't know.
Why do you want celine?
That I know, and I won't tell you.
Now, be reasonable, mr.
Paladin.
I will tell you.
When the revolutionists stormed querétaro,
Celine was ordered to burn the national treasury.
But he didn't.
I was there.
I saw him take the money.
I'm not a greedy man, but when after all these years,
I'm finally so close, I can't let the money
Slip through my fingers a second time.
Perhaps you feel some sense of loyalty to the lady.
A past relationship?
Hmm?
But that would be a tragic error.
Schermer, there's a stench that comes from you.
If I knew where celine was, I don't think I'd tell you now.
He'll hold out.
Time-consuming and boring.
We'll begin with that one.
See here.
I know nothing about this celine.
I only gave her money.
My interest in choltec is...
Purely scientific.
Choltec?
Ho-ho, choltec!
The monastery.
Thank you, my boy.
I regret to say, mr.
Paladin,
That we won't need you any longer.
Ah!
Please.
We can come to terms.
Why should I?
I know now where celine is.
Sutton is armed.
There's a reason.
not much reason.
Sutton, the englishman.
I let him go.
I got my own reasons for finding celine.
What's your offer, sutton?
It's hard country to choltec.
Throw in with me and I'll take your word.
Secura?
That's your business.
But maybe you'd like to know how I got the scar.
I was detailed to guard her and celine after we took querétaro.
She got me off guard.
Maybe you can guess how she did it.
But it was celine that cut me.
After he tied me up for his honor.
But, like I say, that's your business.
So I guess it's check round to you.
What about him?
I'm in no position to hurt anyone.
I alone can make use of celine's money.
What can you gain by...
By killing me?
Only a sense of justice.
Now, you get outta here.
You're mixed into something
You know nothing about, mr.
Paladin.
Take care.
Sutton.
We better make camp here.
It's only me.
All the more reason.
Do you hate me?
Hate?
No.
I don't think hate's the word.
Then what?
Then...
Nothing.
You feel nothing?
You're lying.
You are lying.
A dying woman in search of her husband?
Perhaps I was telling you the truth.
Perhaps you were.
You want the money.
But the thing you're really after is celine.
Why?
Was he the only man who was ever immune to you?
You never said why you want to find celine.
It's not only me.
Nor the money.
No.
I wanna meet the man who has one of the world's toughest
Businessmen willing to crawl on his hands and knees and beg.
A man who's outwitted
One of the most lethal scoundrels I ever met.
Man who has simple, straightforward sutton so twisted with hate
That he's willing to risk his life just to cut celine's throat.
A man who has...
One of the most fascinating women I have ever known
Willing to throw her life away for him.
Whatever it is the world wants...
Or god wants...
Celine withholds.
It's simple.
The desire for something beyond reach.
He is untouchable.
You love him?
I love him.
paladin.
Paladin!
He's gone!
What?
Sutton's gone.
He's gone on ahead.
Please, quickly!
Who is it?
"where is he?" is a better question.
Schermer!
By the rock fall!
Now, you cover me.
Both of you.
Sutton?
Are you thinkin' what I am?
We could perhaps make it together
While they kill each other.
Yeah.
You've forgotten...
Querétaro?
Go on, sutton.
You fool.
You were outta this.
Mr. Schermer needed help.
The winged lion, paladin, really exists!
Just put it down.
I'm not a fool.
I was an athlete.
My reflexes are fast.
Don't try it.
Did I stop him?
You killed him.
And he killed me.
He had to kill celine or me.
Now you're the only one of us who'll...
See celine.
Paladin?
Hmm?
How will you know him?
I'll know.
Excuse me.
My name is paladin.
I'm looking for a man named celine.
You'll find him just there, near the shrine.
Thank you.
I beg your pardon.
My name is paladin.
I'm looking for a man named celine.
What do you want with him?
Not me.
A man named carter,
A man named schermer, and a man named sutton.
I am celine.
In those clothes?
Not yet.
The brothers let me tend this little shrine, stay here.
Perhaps in time.
What are you?
I left three dead men on the trail, men whose lives you...
Destroyed with your own corruption.
My corruption...
Or theirs?
Schermer.
He's dead?
He's dead.
I've had his money waiting here for him.
I have no longer a need for it.
You'd give it to him?
Certainly.
Do you want it?
I'll show it to you.
How much was it?
One million?
Two million?
Is that what schermer told you?
A whole treasury full?
Tropical worms.
Like the rest of the things of this life...
So much dust that crumbles in your hand.
A dream.
And sutton?
Sutton.
The texan.
You scarred his face.
Poor sutton.
He wanted to kill me.
Oh, he...
He wasn't the only one.
This is my last refuge from the suttons of the world.
Monsters that I created.
What if sutton had come?
What would I do?
Give him...
Schermer's money?
Try to make him see
What my ambition and pride had brought me, too?
Or hope to show him
That the celine he came to kill was already dead?
And carter?
Carter hired me to beg you to sign this.
Why is this important to him?
Oh, you forget.
His pride.
His ambition.
Why you?
He would beg like a dog,
But as a man, he has too much pride to beg.
Carter is asking me to help him one more step into hell.
I'll sign it.
There was a woman.
A woman named secura.
Your change of heart...
Comes a little bit late for secura.
Dead?
How?
Defending you.
Killing sutton.
For me?
She died for me?
The celine she loved...
Still lives.
Still lives.
But for what?
We're a small order here.
Very poor.
But in time, we'll bring harmony
And order...
And peace...
To this little corner of the world.

London. 1960.
And St. Swithin's stands where it always has.
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.
Well, you look like a stretcher case to me, mate.
You're beautiful, Nurse.
You're new here, aren't you?
You must let me show you round.
Are you off duty this evening, by any chance?
Fine.
We'll have a little unveiling ceremony, shall we?
You're late, Richard.
What's the matter with you?
You look like something off a marble slab.
- Oh, I'm all right.
- Alcohol, Doctor, in excessive dosage?
You've just got time for a nice little chuck-up.
Go to blazes.
- You're late.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't like being kept waiting by house surgeons.
You ought to know that.
What's the matter?
You look like a dog's dinner.
A decayed one at that.
- I'm all right, sir.
- How's that kidney I yanked out yesterday?
As well as can be expected, sir.
- Not sure I like that remark.
- Sorry, sir, I only...
Don't!
I'm the finest kidney-yanker in Harley Street, and don't forget it.
Sister!
- Yes, Sir Lancelot?
- Where have you been lurking?
You're too old to be bashful.
Leave it to probationers.
Who's in charge of dressings?
- I am, Sir Lancelot.
- Oh.
Are you?
Well, don't go on shoving yards and yards of bandage under my nose like you did last time.
We're not in the embalming business!
And, Sister, for God's sake see I get the right-sized needle.
When I want to sew up a patient, I want to sew him up, not do embroidery on his navel.
You'll find everything's in order, Sir Lancelot.
I sincerely hope so.
I suppose you've all heard I'm retiring?
- I thought that'd shake you.
After 30 years in the butchery business, I've had enough.
Someone else can take over the firm.
I'm sure we're all very sorry to hear it, Sir Lancelot.
Fiddlestick s, my good woman.
You're all tickled pink.
Aren't you, Dr. Burke?
Er, ye...
No, sir.
Don't lie to me, Dr. Burke.
And while I still am in charge, oblige me by not fondling my theatre staff's buttock s.
Thank you.
By the way, Hare...
Oh.
Give him another one!
What the devil is the matter with you today?
Morning, Susan.
- Good morning, Doctor.
- How's the occupational therapy?
- Wonderful!
- You wouldn't like a private patient, I suppose?
The whole hospital knows your idea of occupation, Doctor.
- I just thought I'd see how you are.
- Oh.
- Now, what's it say?
- Oh, I'm all right.
102?
!
That really is a hangover.
I didn't have a drink last night.
No?
I'll tell you what, old man.
- Hm?
- You're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.
- Good Lord!
- What?
It's half past eleven.
Psychosomatic, I'm sure of it.
Inattention.
- What's on your mind, Richard?
- Murder.
What did I tell you?
Clear out and let me talk to him.
You psychos.
This is a blood condition.
It's obvious.
We'll take a pint or two out and get a squint at it.
- No, you don't!
You're not taking my blood!
- It's obvious he ought to have a barium meal.
- Barium meal?
What for?
- Dr. Spencer would want a barium meal.
Dr. Spencer would want a barium meal for a slipped disc.
- You must have a bottle somewhere, Richard.
- Bottle?
I'm not treating you lot to drink s!
Not a full one, an empty one.
We ought to have a specimen.
I'll find something.
- What's going on?
- How did you know anything was going on?
It's all over the hospital.
Can I help?
- You?
You're a ruddy gynecologist.
- Well, you never know.
When I'm changing my sex, I'll send you a postcard.
Keep your hair on.
- I'm keeping everything on!
- Oh!
Could you just cough up a few dreams for us, Richard?
Good grief!
Do you know something?
Either you're dead or I've got a puncture.
I don't care!
Please go away and just leave me!
- You're just an ungrateful patient!
- Please go!
Yes, all right.
Don't push, cock, we all want a gander.
I say, I'm terribly sorry, sir.
What is this, the wake?
I'm a little off color, sir.
So I gather.
I don't know what you feel like but you look positively revolting.
Yes, sir.
You seem to be surrounded by a number of my colleagues.
Possibly I might have the benefit of their opinions.
- Dr. Burke?
- Er, well...
Yes, sir, erm...
I don't know, sir.
There's...
There's a fever, and...
- a temperature of 102.
- Coming up nicely to the boil, eh?
Yes, sir.
The patient complains of not feeling awfully well, sir.
So I've come to the conclusion that he's definitely... ill.
Very concise and helpful.
What about you, madam?
Oh, well...
I wouldn't like to commit myself without a test.
But I suspect a chronic duodenal ulcer.
It's all psychosomatic.
The patient is the victim of inner tensions caused by who knows what.
Possibly an incestuous mother wish creating deep guilt feelings.
Hence the conflict.
The patient feels nausea.
And not the only one to feel that around here at this moment.
Stick out your tongue.
Not you!
You, Hare.
Most rash request of mine.
Veil it decently, man.
Any of you other gentlemen care to enter the discussion?
Here we are.
Just let the dog see the rabbit.
- Tell me, is your father still alive?
- Yes, sir.
Is he a Chinaman?
Chinaman?
No, sir.
h that case, it should be obvious, even to a stringhalt, spavined, one-eyed village chemist, that the patient is suffering from jaundice, common yellow jaundice.
That'll be five guineas.
Good morning, good morning!
- How are you feeling?
- Much better.
- Splendid.
Now, would you like a nice book?
- No, thank s.
I've got one.
Oh...
Oh, good-oh.
Well, I'll be round again tomorrow.
- Are you having a nice rest?
- Yes, yes.
That's the ticket.
Well, I'll push in again tomorrow and...
see if I can tempt you.
Thank you.
Now... you'd like to make a nice pink bunny, wouldn't you?
I beg your pardon?
You take these pieces of felt and stitch them together.
I'll show you how.
And there you have a nice pink bunny.
No, thank s very much.
I really think I'd rather read.
Or I have some raffia.
You could make a pretty basket.
No, thank you.
Not a lovely basket?
No, thank you.
All I want is to be left alone.
Oh, you are a crosspatch, aren't you?
I shall have to talk to Sister about you.
Basket!
- Would you like a bottle.
Doctor?
- Oh, for heaven's...
It's you.
How are you feeling?
Oh, fine, but bored stiff.
You poor lad.
I could have brought you a much more interesting book than this.
I'm a bit short of the necessary.
- So am I.
- Ah, yes, of course.
You've been here eight days now.
This is the time when the young male patients begin to feel their oats.
How are the nurses?
Hello.
Good evening.
I thought I'd just come over and give you the details of my case.
I'm afraid I've forgotten your name.
Florence Nightingale.
I'm terribly sorry.
Is it really?
My mother was a nurse and she had a one-track mind.
- I'm known as Sally.
- Sally.
Oughtn't you to be in bed?
Oh, Sister won't be back for hours.
Here, let me do that.
We don't want you getting marge over your lovely starched apron.
Nurse.
Do you mind!
- Oh, hello.
- What are you doing out of bed?
Well, being a member of the trade, I thought I could take a few liberties.
- I beg your pardon?
- Have you met our new night nurse?
I know Nurse Nightingale very well.
- Hello, Sally.
- Hello, Roger.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't know you'd met.
Well, you're the doctor.
If I'm still awake, do come and talk to me... after Dr. Hinxman has gone.
Now, look here, Sally.
There is a certain professional code...
Well, you've been ordered complete bed rest.
No getting up at all.
Bed rest?
Who said so?
Bed rest?
Who said so?
- Dr. Hinxman.
- But I'm practically cured.
Ours not to reason why, Doctor.
Yes, but bed rest.
That means bed...
Yes, I'm afraid so.
And three-hourly injections of vitamin C and a diet of soya flour soup.
Soya flour?
Would you like some... barley water?
I'd love some.
How are you feeling tonight?
A little overexcited.
Have you got a temperature?
Yes, I rather think I have now.
I dreamt about you last night.
Did you?
No, you wouldn't let me.
There's someone coming!
That was a near thing.
- Sally?
- Mm-hm?
When I get out of here, will you come to dinner with me one night?
I'd be careful if I were you.
Do say you'll come, Sally.
Just the two of us, like now.
No question of dodging muscle-bound clots of house doctors.
Clot?
!
Oh, Sally.
"Oh, Sally"?
Huh!
I am not having any turpentine enemas!
- Oh?
- No.
Well, better talk to Dr. Hinxman about that.
Yes.
Now, what is all this damned nonsense?
You swine!
That's not a very professional way to address your colleague.
- I love Sally more than anything in the world.
- So do I.
I intend to marry her.
So, as it happens, do I.
Now, look here, Har...
Look har, Here...
I'm just an ordinary chap.
- I'm no screen lover, but...
- Ha!
...but I love Sally, and if you try to...
Well, I won't damn well stand for it, do you hear?
And I won't damn well stand for this.
I shall complain to Spratt when he comes round.
Sir Lancelot, I have a complaint to make.
So have I. I left a poker school to come and see you.
And I was winning too.
How is he?
It's very good of you, sir, but really...
- Will you shut up!
- He's very restless, sir.
We've tried all the usual sedatives but he's extremely resistant.
It's not that at all, sir!
Keep your trap shut.
You know nothing about your case.
No doctor does as a patient.
- But I'm perfectly well, sir!
- As you see, sir, he definitely needs sedating.
I'll get the physician to give you something to knock you out.
And if you don't take it.
I'll give you something to make Sleeping Beauty look like a case of galloping insomnia!
- Come on, Hinxman.
- Very good, sir.
Richard?
Richard?
Richard.
Oh!
But you can't!
I mean, you can't marry a girl called Florence Nightingale.
- In fact, you can't marry anyone.
- You watch me.
It's lechery.
It's the starch, fight it.
Have an injection.
- Buy some Indian clubs or something.
- Tony, I love her.
We know all about that.
But you'll be out of a job in a couple of week s.
And so will I.
You won't be able to afford to have a wife.
You'll be lucky if you can afford a stethoscope, even on a party line.
Sally won't mind.
Anyway, something will turn up.
We'd better go and get cleaned up for old Spratt's farewell party.
Let me put it another way.
On the occasion of his retirement,
I ask you to drink to the long life and happiness of Sir Lancelot and his gracious lady.
ALL Sir Lancelot!
Sir Lancelot and Lady Spratt.
Thank you, Mr. Dean.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Personally, I'm delighted to retire.
However.
I've been asked to give advice to some of you young ones.
Get married as quickly as possible.
Most doctors marry nurses or other doctors or barmaids.
About the only women they meet socially.
It makes you respectable, saves you from amorous patients, prevents gossip, gets your telephone answered and is something to do on your evenings off.
Where's Richard?
- What's up?
- Sally.
She's gone off... with a man.
Besides, most men don't like a doctor mucking about with their wife unless the doctor himself has a wife at home.
She left this morning.
Put her resignation into Matron's letter box and went.
- It must have been Godfrey, I suppose.
- Godfrey?
The pilot with the virus pneumonia who was in last month.
Probably halfway to Rio by now.
Unless it was the BBC chap with the asthma.
He was keen on her.
No... the fellow with the shingles and the expense account.
Any other runners?
Plenty.
Well... there we are, then.
Just two scalps on a night nurse's belt.
Nicely starched, too.
Richard.
Spratt wants you.
Spratt's yelling for you.
Go on.
Oh.
- You wanted me, sir?
- Yes, Hare.
Let me introduce you to Dr. Cardew, a neighbor of mine in the country.
He's looking for a new assistant.
I told him you're the least incompetent of this cretinous bunch of nincompoops
- available at this slaughterhouse.
- Thank you, sir.
- Do you ride horses?
- Yes, a bit.
Oh, good.
My present chap's a dear boy, but he's inseparable from his scooter.
I think they cohabit.
Perhaps you'd care to dine with me at my club tonight and have a chat?
- I wouldn't need you for a few week s.
- Thank you very much.
- Lancelot?
- Good evening, Lady Spratt.
I think you ought to talk to Professor...
Your stomach's going to revel in that.
About another three week s, he said.
Well, take it.
How can I take it when my bleeding heart's broken?
You need to get away and relax.
I know just the place.
I'll go with you.
Take your mind off Florence Deadly Nightshade.
It won't cost us a penny, either.
This is a fine ruddy place you've brought me to.
You were saying?
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Do please sit down.
Now, for the benefit of you good people not already cognizant with the drill,
I intend to run the facts through for you quite briefly...
Good morning.
Now, we here are endeavoring through various experiments to pinpoint the causes of the common cold.
Do please listen to this.
Carefully.
Everybody.
It affects you all.
You will be subjected to the various cold viruses by means of inoculation and by other means.
And the results will be very carefully noted.
You will be segregated, in pairs... ...by sexes.
And it is a strict rule that you talk to nobody but your roommate and the staff.
How about that?
You and me, artistic disrobers, priestesses of the nude...
We're just plain strippers, dear.
Common!
...being asked to appear as performing guinea pigs.
Well, it's free.
At least we don't have to tramp around looking for a job for a fortnight.
Oww!
Oh-oh!
It's too hot!
- It's too hot!
Get it off!
- Turn it off!
Aagh!
Turn it off, we're freezing!
That's the spirit.
You're quite comfy.
Up, please.
I must say, one takes off one's hat to you two.
We've never had guinea pigs like you.
You must be terrifically resistant.
There's not a sign of a cold.
- Awfully sorry.
- You haven't come in here to be cold-free.
Personally, I've come here to be rent-free.
We must persevere, must we not?
- Block F now, I think, Professor.
- Oh, yes, rather.
Block F.
A most rewarding sight. 37 dripping noses.
Thank you.
- Good health.
- Good health.
It tastes like something you'd sit in to get rid of a tattoo.
- Coal?
- Coke?
Ice.
Oh, Christmas!
Doctors on the rocks.
Aagh, ooh!
Crikey!
After this, they ought to make us honorary brass monkeys!
What a dump.
It's free.
If you hadn't slapped that manager, we wouldn't have to be here.
I was engaged to pose in that place, not stooge for the comic.
Posing's artistic.
And I never caught a cold doing it and nor did you.
Well, I move about.
Besides, I wear more.
A couple of sequins, that's all.
Well, I'm bored.
I'm bored with nothing to look at except your ugly mug.
I resent that.
But I know what you mean, though.
- We need new faces.
- Female, preferably.
And why stop at faces?
Look.
- Oh, yes.
- But you know the rules.
I envy the doctors here.
At least they can go to the flick s.
Well, we're doctors too.
Yes.
We're doctors too, old man.
The assistant said, "I'm not blaming anyone. "
- But I said, "I am.
I'm blaming the fencer. "
- Yes, I know.
You told me.
Good after... noon.
I'm Dr. Burke and this is Dr. Hare.
Come in.
Excuse me.
I haven't seen you here before.
No, I've just come back off leave, actually, and my colleague here has only just joined the staff.
- Haven't you?
- Hm?
Oh... yes.
How are you, ladies?
- Fed up.
- Oh.
Couldn't you play draughts or something?
We have enough draughts when we're working, thank you.
We'll have to see what we can do.
I brought something for you to take.
Oh, not more germs?
Nice ones, this time.
One more germ in me and they won't have room to park.
Smells like gin.
Gin?
How extraordinary.
Doesn't it?
I couldn't tell if it was neat carbolic.
Yes, well, we often notice that.
A bad head cold has the most extraordinary effect on the... olfactory and gustatory nerves.
The what?
- The pong.
- Oh.
Dr. Flower, come on!
Dr. Burke?
Still resisting strongly.
You know, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever clapped stethoscope on.
Silly!
No, I mean it.
I mean it, honestly.
Now, tell me more about yourself.
Bare your soul.
My soul?
No-one's ever asked to see that before!
- Do you like being a doctor?
- Oh, yes.
What do you do?
Research, mostly.
Oh, how you must have suffered for your art.
It must have been dreadful giving six shows a day at The Windmill.
Oh, it was.
Just think, being stuck in that dreary place 12 hours nonstop.
I couldn't do anything, go anywhere.
You poor child.
Yes.
We used to call it "the prison without bras".
I... hope you're covered by insurance in your work.
It's about all we are covered by!
How's your cold?
Oh, I don't notice it.
I'm getting tiddly!
You know...
Dawn and me were fed to the teeth with this fortnight.
But things are looking up now.
And it's not over yet, darling.
Tell me...
Have you ever broken your clavicles?
- Broken?
- Mm-hm.
They aren't breakable, are they?
No, darling...
No, your clavicles are your collarbones.
Oh, I see!
What do you do in your act?
- I'm a canary.
- A what?
A canary.
I come onto the stage all covered in feathers.
Then what?
I molt!
- Oh, Professor, excuse me.
- Hello.
But there's something you ought to know.
It's about those young ladies.
I was passing the hut and, er...
Oh, come on!
Don't flab.
Well, I heard the most extraordinary noises.
And I rather got the impression that they're not isolated.
And this was thrown from the window.
Now, come on, girls.
Show us what you really do in the show.
I tell you, we can't.
- We haven't got our costumes here.
- We'll imagine those.
We must have our costumes.
Oh, couldn't you make do with bottle tops or something?
Oh, don't be so inartistic!
Bottle tops!
I'm sorry.
I was only trying to be helpful.
I suppose we could give them an idea.
That wouldn't be difficult.
Oh, come on.
You were the one who was feeling homesick.
A workout would do you good.
Not in bottle tops, it wouldn't.
Well... you could find something.
Oh, all right.
But we'll have to get ready and rehearse.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
Now turn round and don't look.
- Don't look.
- Certainly.
- Where are you going?
- We'll wait in here.
They need sterilizing.
Good afternoon, ladies.
And how are we feeling?
- Never felt better.
- Oh, really?
With a cold?
What cold?
The wonderful new germs we've been having.
Ritchie MacDarling.
PROFESSOR:
Will you kindly explain?
Well...
May one ask where you ladies obtained this?
Never mind that.
You're just in time for the show, darling.
- No, please.
- Sit down.
Oh, don't be shy.
It's artistic.
The Rokeby Venus.
Dr. Flower.
- Isolate yourself this instant.
- Yes, Professor, of course.
I insist on knowing where you got this from.
- Doctors brought it.
- What doctors?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Where are they now, might one ask?
Sterilizing themselves.
This is disgraceful.
It's monstrous!
I have never known such crass infringement of the rules.
BOTH Crass infringement of the rules.
It's an orgy!
An orgy?
!
At-choo!
Come on, darling.
Come and lie on the bed with us.
Isn't he gorgeous?
What depravity.
You evil men!
Get up, Dr. Flower.
- Stop this horseplay.
- Oh, Professor.
I suppose you ladies realize that you've violated our strictest rule?
- We never touched him.
- What are you going to do, report us to Equity?
Pack up, please, and leave the establishment instantly.
You've ruined our entire research on you.
Cut along, Dr. Flower, and adjust your dress.
Stop it!
Rokeby Venus!
Aberdeen Angus!
Good luck, cock.
- It's been lovely.
- Bye-bye.
Hope the new show comes up to scratch.
As long as the audience don't, it'll be OK.
Watch out for the germs, doc.
- Bye-bye.
- Oh.
He's lovely.
Bye!
Bye!
It's Dr. Hare, isn't it?
- Yes.
- We were expecting you.
- Dr. Cardew is in the study.
- Oh, thank you.
At-choo!
- Have you got a cold, Doctor?
- Just recovering.
Do you have injections?
I always do.
Never a sniff the whole winter long.
I'm Wildewinde.
- You're what?
- Wildewinde, it's my name.
You'll see a lot of me.
I'm the receptionist, and the dispenser, and look after the forms.
A real universal aunt, as it were.
I do hope you'll be happy here, Doctor.
We are a pleasant little community, healthy too.
Graveled soil, you know.
But we have enough to keep us busy.
Anything you want, but anything, just call for Wildewinde.
This way, Doctor.
- Dr. Hare, Doctor.
- Do forgive me, I didn't hear the bell.
- Thank you, Wildewinde.
Oh, this is Wildewinde.
- The Doctor and I have already... broken the ice.
I really must apologize for Wildewinde.
I took him over with the furniture and never got round to dislodging him.
- He's rather dreadful, but he cleans leather well.
- According to him, he does everything well.
Including getting plastered from time to time.
But only very quietly on his days off.
One hopes.
Have a look at those X-rays.
You'd never think that was the pelvic girdle of a field marshal, would you?
- Rather decorative in a way, aren't they?
- He certainly cracked it.
Yes, poor chap.
Run over by his own lawn mower.
Still, we'll have him leaping around in time.
Mrs. Blewer says lunch in ten minutes, sir.
Oh, and a Mrs. Tadwich rang up for attention.
Tadwich?
Is she on the book s?
No, Doctor.
A newcomer to the fold.
This afternoon I've got to cheer up the Field Marshal, see the Hunt Secretary and be at the college hospital at four.
Quarter to, Doctor.
I think you'd better see that Tadwich, Richard, if you can bear to.
Nothing like breaking the ice, Wildewinde.
Mrs. Tadwich?
I'm Dr. Hare.
You telephoned, I think.
Oh, yes.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
I wasn't expecting you so early.
Well, we usually try and see our new patients first.
You live alone here?
Just Rénée and I.
Mr. Tadwich left.
There's a divorce pending.
- Sorry.
- Shall we go into the bedroom?
Er, no, I...
I don't think that will be necessary, Mrs. Tadwich.
Now, then, what appears to be the trouble?
Well... it's my heart, Doctor.
It's my heart.
I see.
What are the symptoms?
Oh, I don't have symptoms, I have palpitations.
It's a problem heart, you know.
Really?
Well, that's what the specialist said.
I get this... strange tremor... right in the middle of my chest.
- No other manifestation of the condition?
- I'm sorry?
Oh, I mean, is that all?
They said at the hospital it wasn't serious, but... well...
I'd like you to examine me.
Certainly, Mrs. Tadwich.
But, you see, it's really not quite correct for me to...
That's all right, Rénée's here.
Oh, well, in that case...
It sounds like an idiopathic condition to me, no cause for alarm.
That's good.
Well, I'm going to palpate the vibrations in your cardiac area first.
Oh, yes, I can feel a distinct thrill.
Well, we're all human, aren't we, Doctor?
How about coming round one evening for a drink?
- I really don't think so.
- There's Rénée outside.
Would you open the door for her?
Yes, certainly.
I'll be glad of her presence.
Yes, when that dog walked in, I could feel the entire Medical Council breathing down my neck.
I don't blame you.
It's happened to me.
Very tricky, sometimes.
Still, you know the old rule.
It's all right to make a patient out of your mistress, but not a mistress out of your patient.
I'll remember that.
Of course...
Another wig for Mr. Mencroft?
He must smoke them.
Of course, old Spratt was right the other evening.
A doctor is safer if he's married.
- Have you ever been?
- From time to time.
My present wife's in California.
Poor darling, she couldn't bear the smell of ether.
She's got the smog now.
You should try marriage, Richard.
It's quite enjoyable, you know, while it lasts.
- I've just recently been rather badly let down.
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
There are plenty of pretty girls in this neighborhood if you want to try again.
Choose the one with the prettiest legs.
It's as good a way as any.
An emergency case, Doctor.
- Mrs. Mimp's little boy in the surgery.
- What's wrong?
He's lost his head.
Oh, what have I said?
Now, just you sit quiet till the doctor comes, or I'll give you such a smack.
What do you say?
Speak up, I can't hear you.
You're running him in blinkers this season, I see, Mrs. Mimp.
We've tried everything, Doctor.
- How did he get in?
- He's a greedy little boy.
Always was.
May I suggest a tin opener, sir?
Look s like a plumbing job to me.
Carry on, Richard.
I've got an idea.
All right.
Now, then, Wildewinde, you hold the neck of the bottle.
Ow.
Ooh.
Then after I'd got rid of the pimples, I got the hot flushes.
And then to top it all, I woke up one morning and my voice had broken.
Yes, but surely, Mr. Green, all this happened when you were a boy?
Oh, no, last week.
- Last week?
- Yes.
How old are you, Mr. Green?
28.
And I'm right, aren't I, Doctor?
It's arrived, hasn't it?
- What?
- Manhood.
- Well...
- I thought so.
When my landlady's daughter brings me up my early morning tea, I get a very funny feeling.
Yes, well, I shouldn't worry about that, Mr. Green.
I'll give you a tonic.
Now.
Can you come round this evening and collect it?
Yes, Doctor, but not after seven, because I'm taking my landlady's daughter on a ramble.
On second thoughts, I think I'll make that a sedative.
Right, now remember, Mr. Green, take it easy.
You're not very strong, you know.
Oh, no.
No, that's right...
I'm not.
Thank you, Doctor.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Wildewinde?
Coming, Doctor!
Make this up for Mr. Green, will you, please?
Good heavens!
- What's the matter?
- I can read it.
The first time in 15 years.
Congratulations, Doctor.
Wildewinde, I'm off to the hospital.
Has Lord Cornbilly's truss arrived yet?
On your desk, sir, with the seed catalogue you ordered.
- Anything new, Richard?
- No, but there's a call for you from California
- at 4.30 this afternoon.
- California?
Yeah.
Put the truss in the bus, Wildewinde.
Oh, yes, sir.
My dear, I really have only the haziest notion of what you've been saying for the last 20 minutes.
Perhaps it's the smog your end.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Try turning the telephone round the other way.
Look, I think I'd better fly out.
I'll cable you.
All right.
Goodbye, my dear.
Poor thing.
She was never very articulate at the best of times.
Are you going away?
I think I must.
She's in some hopeless muddle about our divorce.
Will you be away long?
Some week s, I'm afraid.
Do you think you can manage?
- Well, I'll do my best.
- There's nothing much on... except the Field Marshal, and he only needs his hand holding from time to time.
We'll get you an assistant.
I'll ring the hospitals now.
Oh, I'll go.
Wildewinde's out.
- I want a London call, please.
- London?
Finish your sandwich first.
Good evening, Doctor.
I'm collecting for the county hospital.
- Tony!
- Got any women patients you don't want?
Still living up to your name, I see.
Do you want a job?
- A job?
Well...
- Come on in, you've got one.
Down here.
Could the doctor see a nasty nosebleed?
Ohh!
I wish you wouldn't do that, Doctor!
I nearly dropped my forceps.
Wildewinde, nip into the dispensary and fix me up with a nice gin and bismuth, will you?
- Certainly not, Doctor!
- Wildewinde... here are the forms.
How are things today?
A bronchitis, a couple of impetigo, measles...
and a puncture.
A lumbar puncture?
No, a nearside front puncture.
My old bus has just about had it.
- How's trade here?
Oh, a bit slackish.
You know, you've got to attract the customers, just like any other business.
How about putting an ad in the local rag?
"Handsome young doctor wishes to meet attractive female patient with a view to an operation. "
- Doctor, think of the ethics!
- To hell with the ethics.
Think of the fun!
"Madam, if your appendix isn't doing anything on Saturday evening, I'd love to take it out. "
I'm not kidding.
Really.
We do need a gimmick of some kind.
- Such as?
- I don't know.
How about putting Wildewinde in the window with a beautiful hand-sewn scar on his tum?
That ought to bring 'em in.
Now I have dropped my forceps!
Dr. Hare?
Yes?
Here she is, sir.
Lovely job, eh?
It's beautiful.
Perhaps you'd like a run-around in her, see the performance?
That's very kind, but I don't really...
I congratulate you on your choice, sir.
What's money when it's a job like this, eh?
What indeed?
My choice?
- Ordered in your name, sir.
- I never ordered this!
Come, sir, it's too late to have second thoughts.
I have documents here.
Just a minute, I'll be right back.
- Dr. Hare?
- Get all this stuff out of here!
Out?
But that other doctor ordered it!
What the devil?
What's going on here?
Doctor's orders, sir.
Tony!
What do you think of it, eh?
American methods.
Give the place some zing.
Would you mind signing that, please?
- Very nice.
What about that car outside?
- It's come, has it?
Oh, good.
It'll add an air to the practice, don't you think?
All we need is a nice sexy receptionist and we're all set.
Set for what, bankruptcy?
Have you any idea what these things cost?
- Sexy receptionists?
- No, you stupid idiot, the car!
You don't have to worry about things like that.
We'll get it off the income tax.
Tony, have you got any idea what the income of this practice is?
You're being a bit reactionary, aren't you?
- It's fatal for a young doctor.
- Look here, Tony...
Wildewinde?
You're not leaving.
Are you?
I am indeed, Doctor.
I will stay no longer in a practice where this sort of thing is attached to my door.
Ooh, this is much better than the Palais.
Yes, it's certainly more intimate.
I didn't think doctors did this sort of thing.
Well, given half a chance, doctors will do every sort of thing.
Saucy!
Do you like me, Kitten?
Yes, I do.
Your cha-cha's real cool.
Oh.
You know, you're wasted in a shop like...
Jennifer Modes?
Yes, we must find something more worthy for you.
Excuse me, Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Hello, Burke here.
No, no, Dr. Burke.
Good evening, Doctor.
I believe you are on the rota as police surgeon this week.
Oh, am I?
Well, if you say so.
We traced you from your home.
We've got a case here...
Drunk!
That... is a slanderous statement!
I'm wanted by the police.
- Why, what have you done?
- Well, nothing yet... unfortunately.
You stay there.
I'll be back.
Don't talk to a soul.
I'll run over you for fingerprints when I return.
He was being most difficult in the high street, sir.
The constable simply had to bring him in.
I was merely expressing a desire... to see my dear old mother!
You were... to music.
I happen to be possessed of a true countertenor voice.
I could make a fortune on the telly.
All right, thank you.
Just keep blowing.
Keep blowing, sir.
I wish to see... my own medical attendant.
- All right, sir.
Dr. Hare will be here in a minute.
- Dr. Hare?
Here you are, Doctor.
Now you test it for alcoholic content.
Oh.
Doctor!
What have you been drinking, Wildewinde?
Esso Extra?
The Leith Police dismisseth us.
What?
The Leith Police dismisseth us.
It's the next test.
Try it, Doctor.
The Leith Polith...
These Police...
The Leith Polith...
Ahem.
Wildewinde, I'm supposed to be examining you.
And now the finger test.
Watch, everyone.
BURKE Jolly good.
Dead centre.
And I did not peep.
What next, Doctor?
And now we go walkie-walkies.
Wildewinde knows.
BURKE See, Wildewinde knows.
That's awfully good, Wildewinde.
I can do better than that.
Watch.
Sir, come down!
Shush.
Oh, Doctor!
Thank goodness you've come.
They all think Wildewinde's intoxicated.
And is he?
Look, Richard!
No hands.
Sir!
Tony, come down!
Tony, you're going to hurt yourself.
Careful, you're going to break something!
Tony!
No, George, I didn't fire him and he didn't quit.
He's in hospital with a broken arm.
Well, can't you please send me an assistant before I go clean round the bend?
I can't think of anyone from here, but I'll scout around the others and see.
Any particular kind?
If he's qualified and has reasonable ethics...
All right, then.
You'll do your best, George?
Yes, thanks.
Bye.
Oh.
Would you...
Would you mind waiting in the waiting room?
- I'm not a patient.
I want to see the doctor.
- Well, that's me.
No, the other one with the bow tie and the hot eyes.
Oh, you mean Dr. Burke?
I'm afraid he's temporarily unavailable.
What a shame.
When I met him at the club, he told me there was a receptionist job going.
Did he?
As a matter of fact, there is.
Tell me, what are your qualifications, Miss...?
Strudwick.
Well, I'm a very good secretary and I'm learning to type.
I've been with Jennifer Modes for a year.
I see.
Well, do sit down, Miss Strudwick.
Now you want to make a change, is that it?
There's nothing like variety.
The other doctor said it was living in.
He said it would be nice for him to have me in easy reach.
In case of emergencies.
Yes, I see.
Come back next week, Mr. Luke.
You bet I will, Doctor!
Next patient, please.
One at a time, please.
- Telephone, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes, this is Doctor Barrington.
Yes, I do want some experience in general practice.
How do I know I'd be right for him?
An African witch doctor would be all right from the way he's talking.
I'll give you the address and you can let him know.
As soon as you can make it.
All right.
Bye.
I said next week, Mr. Luke.
Couldn't I come before?
You're doing me the power of good, Doctor.
I'm afraid I shan't be here.
Oh?
Who will be, then?
Dr. Harvey will look after you.
Dr. Harvey?
Next patient, please.
I think you'll find it's all pretty simple.
h here we keep the patients' file cards.
You fill in a new card for each new patient and keep it up to date.
And in here we have the application blank s for... oh, glasses, teeth, wigs and appliances.
Quite a palaver, isn't it?
Well, I'm sure you'll quite soon get the hang of it.
And in here, we have the secret and confidential files.
Yes, well...
Dr. Burke was very interested in anatomy.
Yes, wasn't he?
You wouldn't know he was a doctor.
But I ought to have guessed.
He had such lovely soft hands... when he cha-cha'd.
Yes.
Well, now, let's get on, Miss Strudwick.
Why don't you call me Kitten?
Everyone does.
Oh, I think for professional reasons we'll keep it as Miss Strudwick.
You're one of the shy sort, aren't you?
Not like Dr. Burke.
Yes.
- Well, time for surgery.
- Oh.
- Oh, a telegram arrived for you over the phone.
- Oh.
Yes?
"Arriving 545 tomorrow to act as assistant if agreeable...
- Thank goodness.
... Nicholas Barrington. " Nicholas.
Mmm, I like that name.
Oh, good.
Well, perhaps he cha-cha-chas.
Yeah.
Oh, good afternoon.
I have an appointment with the other doctor.
- Me too.
- So do I.
Really?
Oh, I bet you cha-cha-cha.
Cha-cha-cha?
Yes.
Well, I'm awfully sorry, ladies, but I'm afraid the job's gone.
So has the other doctor.
But I can cha-cha!
Terribly sorry.
So sorry.
One job, one girl.
That's the way it is.
I'm terribly sorry.
- But the job really has gone.
Oh, no.
Not another one!
I'm afraid you've wasted your time.
The job's gone.
- Gone?
- Yes, it's Dr. Burke's fault.
He's left, too.
- Awfully sorry.
- But I've come from London!
London?
What's he playing at?
I don't know.
I've never met him.
Never m...
Oh, but don't you cha-cha-cha?
Cha-cha-cha?
Sometimes, at hospital dances.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
You've come instead of Dr. Barrington.
No.
No?
I am.
You...
Nicholas?
Nicola.
Oh...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, don't worry.
It's always happening.
When I arrived as a student at St. Savior's, they put me down for a lodge meeting and a rugger trial.
Do you mind a woman assistant?
No, not at all.
Would you like a cigarette?
It's all right, I...
- have my own.
- Yes, I'm sure you have.
Well, now, my boss, Dr. Cardew, is away in California for the time being.
You'll have his room and there's a secretary who lives in, too.
Are you married?
No.
When do we start?
- Start?
- Work.
Oh, yes, work.
Well, right away.
Oh, well, just give me a second to unpack.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.
Er, Miss Strudwick, Dr. Barrington.
And I'm the minister of health!
Pleased to meet you.
You know, you're making quite a hit in this town.
All the patients are asking for you.
Yes, but most of them are men and they want to examine me.
They look on me as some sort of freak.
Oh, I wouldn't call you that.
Well, women doctors are still rather novelties.
Yes, I expect there's a bit of gossip.
Anyway, that's why I want to go halves tonight.
Let's have dinner and I'll tell you about my symptoms.
Symptoms?
What symptoms?
Well every time I look into your eyes, I have an irresistible desire to kiss you.
What do you think I should do about that?
Well, good night.
Good night, Nicky.
I enjoyed that.
So did I.
- Very much.
- We must do it again.
On the National Health next time.
Good night.
Good night.
I thought you might like to see the new copy of The Lancet.
Oh.
Thank you.
Just in case you can't sleep.
I shall sleep.
Well, I don't feel very sleepy.
Try.
You've got to work tomorrow.
- Yes.
- Good night.
Night.
Oh, er... you haven't such a thing as a sleeping pill, have you?
There are lots in the drug cupboard.
Yes, I know, but I...
I seem to have lost my key.
Oh.
Well, I've got some Aspro.
Oh, they'll be fine.
- It's a... nuisance when you can't sleep, isn't it?
- Mm.
I thought I might make myself a hot drink later.
- Good idea.
- Would you like one now?
No, thank s.
- Here you are.
- Oh.
Thank you.
- Did...
Did you read that Lancet?
- Not yet.
There's an article in it on heart stimulation.
I'd like to discuss it with you.
Fine... in the morning.
Yes.
Well, er... good night.
Good night.
Night.
Mmm...
Oh...
Come in.
I saw your light was still on.
What is it?
I was wondering if you had such a thing as a saucepan.
No.
What for?
Well, I wanted to make myself that hot drink and I can't find one.
Well, there must be one in the kitchen somewhere.
I can't see one.
Oh, all right.
I'll come and look.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
I'm...
I'm sorry to trouble you.
It's all right.
Your insomnia's rather sudden, isn't it?
- Oh, no, I'm a...
I'm a martyr to it.
- Hm.
I'll make a couple of drink s and bring you up one, shall I?
An early morning cup of tea would be more suitable.
- Well, whatever you like.
- There must be a saucepan somewhere.
You'd think so, but I can't find one anywhere.
Are you quite sure you looked?
I'm so sorry to trouble you at this time of night, Doctor, but he's done it again.
Your problem is solved.
Good night, Doctor.
All right, Mrs. Mason, don't worry.
I'll come round later this evening.
- Yes, goodbye.
- Would you see Harold, please?
Mr. Harold Green, I mean.
Who?
Oh, yes.
Er... in the surgery, please.
No, I think here would be better.
He's got something on his mind.
Oh.
Hello, Mr. Green.
All right, thank you, Miss Strudwick.
Oh, I think he'd rather I stayed.
You see, we're getting married.
So I've got to know the worst.
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- I suppose it means you'll want to leave us now.
- When it's convenient.
Harold would like to talk to you, Doctor.
Yes, of course.
Do sit down.
Thank you, Doctor.
Well, um...
I would like for you to give my spouse and self a talk.
A talk?
Yes... a frank talk.
Oh, you mean about...
Yes.
Well, I'd have thought that your espoused was more qualified...
I mean...
We're all ears, Doctor.
Well, as you know, in marriage there's a man and a woman and possibly children.
- There's nothing to it, really.
- But I'm naturally concerned about our relations.
I don't think they'd worry about a few children.
Oh, I wasn't referring to those relations, Doctor.
Oh, no.
Quite.
Well, there's some very good books on the subject.
I know a couple who read one of those.
Didn't they find it helpful?
All I know is, the man turned up to work the next day with a fractured ankle.
Yes.
Well, you have to follow the instructions rather carefully.
As a matter of fact, I think we have some excellent literature on the subject over here.
It puts things very clearly.
Oh.
Excuse me.
I think this tells you all you need to know.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yes?
Yes, all right.
I'll be round this evening.
Oh!
Oh, no!
Goodbye.
I don't think Harold's quite ready for this yet, Doctor.
- I'm frightfully sorry.
- Oh!
Wagstaff Hall, Cornwall Street.
Now, where the devil is that?
Leave it to me, dear.
Why you want to let me in for attending this damn lecture I don't know.
I should be pruning the roses.
I was thinking of the roses, dear.
You're apt to confuse pruning with amputating.
Mind that damn bus, woman!
Bar's open.
It's just over there.
I'll pick you up when I've done my shopping.
All right, dear.
And while you're at it, get a case of Glen Grant whisky.
I shall need reviving.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
- Hello, Billet.
- Hello, Lancelot.
- I didn't think this was your meat.
- Well, I...
They say...
I hope they've got something interesting.
I didn't come all this way for kindergarten stuff.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me, sir, are you a member?
Member?
I'm a member of everything, though God knows why at my age.
May I see your card, then, sir?
I'm Sir Lancelot Spratt, past president of the Royal College of Surgeons.
I don't carry cards.
A doctor?
Well, is somebody ill, sir?
There'll be somebody at the gates of death hammering for admission if you don't let me in.
Cor, you ain't half got a big head.
- I know you.
You're Burke.
- Yes, sir.
Since when did you take an interest in this sort of thing?
Since I was a very little boy, I think, sir.
I'm surprised to see you.
I'm a bit surprised to see you, sir.
How did you do that?
I lost my balance, sir.
Hm.
I don't see any of the familiar faces here.
Usually these lectures are crammed with the whole General Medical Council.
May I say how gratifying it is to see such a large and distinguished gathering here today?
I miss one or two faces, but no doubt urgent business has prevented them from coming.
What time's this damn thing start?
I could do with a drink.
I think that may be a good idea, sir.
It's very civilized having a bar.
I can see myself enjoying this.
I very much hope you're right, sir.
Good God!
Where the hell am I?
The Haystack, sir.
It's a club.
I can see it's not a Women's Institute.
Now, before I show these slides which illustrate our discovery,
I should just like to sketch in the background of my work which led up to it.
And now The Haystack Club takes great pleasure in presenting the lovely, luscious, lovable Leonora, in famous pictures by famous painters.
First, The Rokeby Venus... by Velázquez.
I know you.
Oi!
Where do you think you're going?
I sliced you up at St. Swithin's a couple of years ago.
- I never forget a face.
- Why, it's Sir Lancelot.
Well, isn't it nice?
MAN Chuck him out!
Silence!
Haven't you got any manners?
What puzzles me is what you've done with the scar.
There's no scar, Sir Lancelot.
It was my tonsils you took out.
So it was.
Very good thing for you in your job!
Sir... young man...
It's all right, keep calm.
Just a routine check on membership.
The police!
Quick, this way.
Put her down!
You're not a paid-up member.
Come on.
There's a street door on the other side.
We'll show you.
Beasts such as these distinguished highland gentlemen were often pursued by hairy old monsters like these.
Bravo!
Breathing better, aren't I, Doctor?
All right, get dressed.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Nicky.
Oh, Richard, I'm glad you're there.
Listen, I'm up in New Town.
Well, there's a case up here, a child.
No, it's pretty serious.
Can you come and have a look?
Yes, all right.
What's the address?
- Well?
- Temperature's up.
- To what?
- 104.
Is he vomiting?
Mm.
He started a little while ago.
Well, there's a chap called Deakin who's been working on a new serum.
It's not generally available yet.
- I'll have to telephone to London.
- OK.
All right.
I'm glad you called me, Nicky.
I'm afraid your little boy's rather ill, Mrs. Parker.
But he's...
He's going to be all right, isn't he, Doctor?
Well, children have a great deal of resistance.
It's probably only flu.
These damn schools don't look after 'em.
No, I'm afraid it's rather more serious than that.
Well, you're a doctor, aren't you?
Well, do something, then.
But I've got to have it, sir.
Yes, I know, but Dr. Deakin's out of England now.
Look, sir, this is a very urgent case.
I appreciate that you think that, Dr. Hare.
But this particular drug is highly dangerous.
I cannot accept the responsibility of releasing it without Dr. Deakin's approval.
I suggest you try and contact him.
Good night.
But, Dr. Mincing, I...
Hello?
Mincing?
Yes, I know the perisher.
One of the Creator's less appetizing efforts.
What do you want me to do about it all?
If you could speak to him, sir, use your influence.
Can't any of you get it into your heads I've retired?
There's no need to shout, Lancelot.
The servants know.
Well, thank God somebody does.
This new drug...
I haven't bothered to keep up with them all, too busy.
Will it work?
I don't know, sir.
It's the only hope.
You realize you may be making a bloody fool of yourself?
I don't mind that.
But you may be asking me to make a fool of myself!
I know, sir, but I'm thinking about the patient.
I don't care about anything else.
Very well.
And heaven help you if you're wrong.
- I've got his telephone number here, sir.
- I don't need it.
I'll play this my own way.
- Where's the key to the garage?
- Where it always is.
May I remind you that we've got the Lord Lieutenant coming to dinner?
Oh, tell the old fool I've bust my braces and gone to bed.
Come on, Hare.
Keep your ruddy Russian salad off the Queen's highway, you blasted oaf!
I've already told Dr. Hare the drug is still on the experimental list.
If you'd care to try and contact Dr. Deakin, you may use this telephone.
He's gadding about on the continent.
This is urgent.
- I cannot release it without authority.
- I'm giving you it!
I'm afraid that's hardly sufficient, Sir Lancelot.
May I remind you you've retired?
A great loss to medicine, I'm sure.
But no doubt you felt that it was necessary to give way to younger men.
I want that drug, Mincing.
I've already given you the explanation, Sir Lancelot.
I have an overwhelming desire, Mincing, to lay you flat and slit your throat and I may yield to it!
If you threaten me, Sir Lancelot, I shall be compelled to have you removed, by the police.
The police, you miserable wet nurse?
They'd help me sharpen the knife!
But the attendant publicity wouldn't be very agreeable.
That is, of course, so.
To call the operator, just ask for Continental Enquiries.
Thank you.
Give me Fleet Street 8000, the night editor, please.
When you reach my age, with one foot in the grave, publicity doesn't mean anything.
But for a younger man...
Just a moment, Sir Lancelot.
Ever noticed how the press are inclined to pull out all the stops for a sick child?
- This is hardly ethical, Sir Lancelot.
- I gave that up when I retired.
It's a great relief.
Hello, Cudliffe?
Lancelot Spratt.
How's the ulcer?
Good.
Now, listen.
There's a ca...
Get out of my lap!
This isn't a necking party.
There's a red light, sir.
I haven't stopped at a red light since Port Said in 1920.
I have to warn you there are certain risk s attached to this.
I need your permission to try.
- Well, of course, Doctor.
- Thank you.
- Well, I don't like it.
- Oh, for God's sake!
They're just mucking about.
I'll make a complaint about this.
That kid should be in hospital.
All you doctors are the same.
Using the kid as a ruddy guinea pig.
Now, you listen to me, Parker.
While you and I are talking in here, your son's dying.
Now, I think that this can save him.
If I'm wrong, you can make it as hot for me as you like afterwards.
But it won't bring him back.
There's just a chance that this can help.
I wish I didn't have to ask for your permission to give him this injection, but I do.
So I'll ask you once more.
Do I have it?
Oh, all right.
Do what you like.
Well, we won't be absolutely certain for another couple of hours.
You may as well go home and try and get some rest.
- OK.
- I predict he'll go to sleep now.
Aah!
I am so sorry.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
- What do you want?
- Well, actually, I rather wanted to go to bed.
I'm afraid there's really nothing for you to steal here.
Oh, I don't know.
There are a couple of pictures and the silver's not bad.
Kitten!
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.
Stay where you are.
And don't make a run for it.
My dear girl, I've been on the run for week s.
I'm exhausted.
You don't look like a burglar.
Perhaps it's the suntan.
Where did you pick it up?
California.
You're an international operator.
Hello?
- Police?
Hello, hello?
California?
What is this?
Who's speaking?
I'm most terribly sorry, it's a false alarm.
I thought I had a burglar.
You're Dr. Cardew.
And I'm in... your bed.
I assure you, I can't think of a nicer place for you.
Oh.
Well, we weren't expecting you, you see.
I'm Nicola Barrington.
And I help Richard.
Lucky Richard.
Oh, no.
No, I...
I mean that...
What's the matter?
Well, you are an old sly boots, aren't you?
It's all right, Kitten.
He...
He's Dr. Cardew.
Good morning, and whom do you help?
Dr. Burke?
No, he's gone.
Not Wildewinde, unless times have changed?
Wildewinde's gone, too.
Took off on his broomstick at last, did he?
What a relief.
It's all right.
His temperature's down and he's sleeping.
Oh, thank God!
Good morning, Richard.
Oh, Clive, you're back.
Oh, this is my fiancée.
Thank goodness!
It was wearing me out!
I want to hire a wedding outfit.
Yes, sir.
Will you take the cubicle at the end, sir, and I'll send an assistant?
- Thank you.
- Mr. Fordyce?
The trousers are a little tight, my lord.
And what medals shall we put on, General?
The lot?
I'm afraid that is all the crowns we have, Your Highness.
TONY:
Not bad.
Haven't you got something a bit gayer?
That's the correct one for a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, sir.
- Richard!
- Tony.
Well, congratulations.
I didn't know they'd made you a fellow.
Oh, it's...
What about one of those gold tassel jobs with whatnots and things?
Yes, sir, but that's worn only by the presidents.
Ah, well, let's have a gander at it.
Eh, what?
They haven't made me a fellow, actually.
But I've been asked to conversazione by an American professor.
A lovely thing she is, too.
Stack s of money and impressionable with it.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
That should do the trick, all right.
- Room to hide a bottle under it, too.
- Should fool anyone.
Yeah.
Do you think so?
What are you doing here, anyway?
- Hiring a wedding outfit.
- Oh?
Who's getting married?
I am.
To your successor.
What?
You mustn't do a thing like that.
A woman doctor?
I can just see her now.
Steel-rimmed glasses and buck teeth.
- Oh, Tony.
- I know, and think!
You'd better come to Hampton Cross and meet her.
She'll be there this weekend.
I think I better had.
You need life-saving!
And you need a morning suit.
You're going to be best man.
I say, excuse me...
Well, think it over.
This practice could do with a woman doctor.
You could hold the Field Marshal's hand for a change.
Do you think married doctors working together would do?
- Well, why ever not?
- I was only wondering.
There's an answer to your advert.
The one to take the place of me.
I've put her in the surgery.
Do the exploratory, will you, Richard?
I'm not decent.
Yes, all right.
So sorry...
- Good Lord!
Sally.
- Richard!
But you're not after this job?
- Yes.
- Why?
Well, I live quite near here.
Jobs are difficult to get for an unfrocked nurse.
- W-What about that pilot?
- What pilot?
Well, Hinxman said that you'd gone off with a pilot... or a BBC chap.
Nothing so exciting.
I was sacked.
Matron said I was too friendly with the patients.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my fault, I'm afraid.
Well, I asked for it, I suppose.
I don't really know very much about Richard.
About his past, anyway.
Well, I wouldn't say he was an actual Jack the Ripper, would you?
No, but it would be nice to know if there are any skeletons about.
Sally, do you think you could develop amnesia about that little affair?
Don't worry, it's a job I want now.
Well, then, you can have it.
How marvelous!
But shouldn't you ask your partner first?
Well, he's... he's not here at the moment.
You call by on Monday and I'll fix it all up.
Oh, thank you, Richard.
You are a dear.
The investigation's taking rather a long time, isn't it?
We must have the right girl.
- Well?
- Oh, I think she'll do.
- She's coming on Monday.
- What's her name?
Florence Nightingale.
Oh, really, Ri...
She's just a girl.
Won't need to supply her with a lamp.
We don't need a lamp to see the lipstick on your cheek.
Oh.
Well... she was very grateful for what I'd done.
What exactly had you done?
- Oh, Nicky...
- Well?
Hello, sir.
I just bumped into Florence Nightingale.
What's she doing here?
You're not engaged to her again, Richard?
No, this is my fiancée.
Tony Burke.
Is it, indeed?
Well, well, well.
What a pleasant surprise.
May I kiss the bride?
- The best man's prerogative.
- Certainly not.
Of course you may.
Oh, I must congratulate you, Richard.
Your taste has improved immeasurably since the old days.
When I think of the bits you used to take around when we were at St. Swithin's.
I mean...
Tell us about the bits, Dr. Burke.
Tony, please.
I want you to always think of me as an old, old friend of the family.
- Shall we dance?
- Thank you.
You're not at the Palais now, remember?
- Phone call for you, Dr. Hare.
- Hm?
- Phone call, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Nicky.
Nicky!
Oh, Richard's one of the best.
A bit simple sometimes, perhaps.
A little bit flighty.
Tell me about Sally Nightingale.
Oh, yes... pretty girl.
There was nothing in that, really.
I don't want to talk about other girls when I'm dancing with the prettiest one in the business.
Look, I've got to go to a call.
Cardew's out already.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, I'll take you home first.
Home?
Nonsense!
We're just getting into the beat, aren't we, Nicky?
Yes, I'd like to stay.
Well, I'll be back as soon as I can.
Well, take your time.
Don't you worry about us.
Nicky?
Nicky?
Where's Tony?
- Gone back to London.
- Oh, did he offer you a lift?
Yes, he did, as a matter of fact.
What are you doing, acting like that in the club?
You're meant to be my fiancée.
You'd better decide whether your fiancée is me or the lady with the lamp and a lot of lipstick.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Sally and I were all over ages ago.
Is that why you welcome her into the family circle now?
Look, I tell you, she means nothing to me!
- Keep your voice down, you'll wake up Clive!
- Oh, s...
Where are you going?
You're staying here tonight.
I'm not.
Why didn't you accept Clive's offer to stay?
Don't you like him?
Yes, I like him very much.
I just don't want to be the first on your matrimonial round.
- Nicky, I'm not like that.
- It's no use.
Doctors shouldn't marry doctors.
They shouldn't marry at all!
You mean you're chucking me over after all this?
Yes, I am.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Richard.
- Nicky?
- I'm ever so sorry, Doctor, really I am.
Oh, no.
Oh, it's a great pity.
I was looking forward to having our Dr. Barrington on the string.
I'm afraid all that's gone into the disposal bin.
The Field Marshal quite perked up when I told him about her.
Oh, well, he'll just have to concentrate on his memoirs now.
- You still love her, don't you?
- Yes.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
I did warn you.
I know.
Well, I'll get over it.
If only one could inoculate against it.
The boffin who isolates that virus will deserve the Nobel Prize and a bust in every registry office from here to Lapland.
Dr. Cardew.
Oh, hello, my dear.
Good gracious.
Well, we'll have to cope with that.
Yes, this morning.
All right.
I think you'd better answer that distress signal.
It'll be a counterirritant.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, sir.
- What the blazes do you want?
- Oh, Lady Spratt sent for me, sir.
I didn't.
So get out of here, you miserable leech.
Nonsense, Lancelot.
I sent for the doctor because you're not well.
I'm perfectly well.
I just happen to choose to spend the morning in bed.
Well, I'm tired of your having stomach aches and blaming the food,
When you know perfectly well Mabel is the best cook we've ever had.
Stomach ache, sir?
Just because my guts gripe from time to time, this damn woman thinks I'm at death's door.
Stop bawling, Lancelot, and let Dr. Hare examine you.
I refuse.
Lancelot... at the moment, all your Napoleon brandy is standing on the corner of the kitchen sink.
If you refuse, I'll ring the bell and ask Perkins...
But this is blackmail!
Something like it.
I quite agree.
Very well.
See your hands are warm.
Go on, man!
You've seen a belly before, haven't you?
Yes, sir, but... there are certain exceptional circumstances.
- It's the sort of moment of truth.
- What?
!
Nothing.
I... really wanted to ask you some questions first.
Later!
I'm getting chilly.
Very well, sir.
If you're going to examine me, examine me.
Don't tickle me.
I'm not a chit of a nurse.
There are certain differences, sir.
Does that hurt?
Of course it hurts, you nincompoop!
Why do you think I sent for you?
Well, sir, in my opinion, you have acute appendicitis.
I've been telling him that for months.
She's been telling me.
Do you hear that, Hare?
Telling me.
- I think it should come out as soon as possible.
- Rubbish.
Now, Lancelot, either your appendix goes or I do.
There isn't room for it and me in this house.
Never tangle with women, Hare.
Very well.
But I won't go into any nursing home.
I'll come into your local slaughterhouse
- so I can keep an eye on things.
- Shall I get Richardson from St. Swithin's?
Richardson?
He's nothing but a painless killer!
- Well, then, Braithwaite?
- Braithwaite?
!
He loathes my guts and he'd jump at the chance to remove them, even if it meant a murder rap.
You'd better do it yourself.
Me?
!
I've taught you all you know and I'd just as soon trust you as anybody else.
- Yes, I know, sir, but...
- Damn it, Man!
You're being offered the chance to slice up one of the best-known breadbaskets in Britain.
If you don't slaughter me, you're made for life!
But you can't do this to old Richard.
He's a bit of a clot in some ways, I know, but... he's my oldest friend.
You must marry him.
Besides...
I've bought the cigarette box.
I haven't actually, but I've seen it.
I thought you weren't so keen on marriage.
Not as a general rule, but... this is different.
I mean, you...
You do him good.
Excuse me.
Oh, good morning, Dr. Cardew.
Good morning.
I'm sorry to arrive like this, but I was in London and I thought I'd return this.
- I found it in my cupboard.
- Oh.
Well, go in and sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
- Hello, Tony.
- Oh, hello, sir.
How's old Richard?
Richard?
Well, I'm a bit worried about Richard.
He's not ill, is he?
I'm afraid we've got an appendix operation on our hands.
It should be all right, but Sir Lancelot isn't too happy about it.
Sir Lancelot?
Is he doing it?
He insists on being there.
But why?
An appendectomy isn't serious.
Well, there were certain...
complications in this case.
Is it a big op, then?
In a sense, yes.
- When?
- This afternoon.
I must go.
I've got to get back there.
Poor old Richard.
Oh, well... can you give me a lift?
Well, certainly, my dear.
Thank you.
I'd better get up there, too.
I might be able to help in some way.
Well, we can only hope that it all...
comes out all right.
If I have to wait much longer, you'll have to put the cause of death down as old age.
What's the hold-up?
Can't find a burial plot?
- No, sir, it's not that.
As a matter of fact, it's...
- Tell them to book a big plot, about 40 acres.
I sleep very restlessly.
We're waiting for the anesthetist.
Why don't you get another one?
They're two a penny.
I think you should have a little sedative, Sir Lancelot.
And I think you should both... get out of here!
I hope he comes soon.
You'd need a sledgehammer to knock the old boy out in this state.
What are you two nattering about over there?
I'd really just like to get to the hospital.
I don't need a drink.
- It's good for shock.
- I'm not suffering from shock.
I think you may be later.
He will come through it all right, won't he?
I'd say that all depends on his doctor.
You've got to get here, quick!
Well, can't you get a lift off someone?
- Hello, old boy.
- Well, there must be something you can do.
- Richard!
- Oh, never mind.
Forget it.
Tony, you did anesthetics at St. Swithin's, didn't you?
- Anesthetics?
Yes, why?
- Tell Sister I've got a substitute anesthetist.
Why are you walking about?
You ought to be being shaved and knocking back Omnopon.
You come with me.
In here.
Sorry.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Where have you been, girl?
- Sorry, sir.
Do you want a...
- No, I don't want a bottle.
Find Dr. Hare and tell him I'm off and taking my ruddy appendix with me.
It's all right, Sir Lancelot, we have an anesthetist.
And about time, too.
What's that?
Just a preliminary prick to make you drowsy.
Drowsy?
I've got to keep my eyes skinned till the last moment in this dump!
Take it away, woman!
Anything to oblige, old man.
You know, I was worried sick coming up here.
It'll be fun twiddling the old knobs again.
By the way, who's the patient?
- Lancelot Spratt.
- Oh, really...
Spratt?
!
Not on your life!
He'll go right up the wall!
No, you don't.
You mucked up my marriage for me.
You're not going to muck this up, too.
Yes, but he'll recognize me.
The patient's on his way up, Doctor.
Put your mask on and keep it on.
- Sir Lancelot, wait!
- Take this, my man.
Who sent this ruddy pram down to me?
You, Sister?
- Well, it is customary, Sir Lancelot.
- I know and £5 extra on the bill.
I know these trick s, and I'm quite capable of walking, thank you.
I must say, you're an unsanitary-looking lot.
It gives me blood poisoning just to look at you.
- Are those things sharp?
- Oh, yes, Sir Lancelot.
We had them all rubbed up on the doorstep.
And there's a hammer and chisel in the sterilizer
- in case it's needed.
- My stomach is no laughing matter, Doctor.
Yes, sir.
I think Lady Spratt would agree, sir.
Now, you nurses...
I don't want any swabs or odds and ends left floating around inside me.
One swab and you're for the Old Bailey!
So remember.
Well, Sir Lancelot, shall I start carving?
Otherwise the plates will get cold.
- Where's Dr. Hare?
- Dr. Hare?
He's in the theatre.
Already?
Never mind.
We'll wait.
Take your hands off me, woman.
You're supposed to be sterile.
Now, Hare... when I come round, if I ever do,
I don't want any nonsense about sips of glucose and smarmy talk.
There's a bottle of Heidsieck in my room and I expect it to still be there.
- That's very kind of you, sir.
- For me!
And don't forget it's my appendix.
I don't want to be handed my tonsils in a jar with the apologies of a matron.
When are we starting this mammoth production?
Where's the anesthetist?
I'm right here, Sir Lancelot.
Gassed any rabbits lately?
What's your name?
Erm...
MacGregor?
SPRATT Another ruddy Scotsman.
I don't need any examination.
My heart's as sound as a bell.
Good, good.
Just pump the stuff into me and keep on pumping until I'm sewn up.
- Aye.
- And if I start turning blue, you'll hear from me!
I ken what you mean, Sir Lancelot.
You can have the utmost confidence in me.
Get on, man.
You're not drilling for uranium.
Och.
Prick me, don't skewer me!
I'm not a shish kebab!
Terribly sorry.
I know you!
I kicked you out of the theatre at St. Swithin's.
What the devil's going on here?
If you think I'll let myself be messed about by some oaf who doesn't know the difference between sewer gas and nitrous oxide, you're jolly well mis...
Scalpel.
- All over, Sister?
- Yes, Dr. Cardew.
How is Dr. Hare?
As well as can be expected under the circumstances.
I'm going in.
Richard!
- Darling?
Nicky!
Where's that funny champagne?
ITFC Subtitles
Ripped by:
SkyFury
London. 1960.
And St. Swithin's stands where it always has.
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.
Well, you look like a stretcher case to me, mate.
You're beautiful, Nurse.
You're new here, aren't you?
You must let me show you round.
Are you off duty this evening, by any chance?
Fine.
We'll have a little unveiling ceremony, shall we?
You're late, Richard.
What's the matter with you?
You look like something off a marble slab.
- Oh, I'm all right.
- Alcohol, Doctor, in excessive dosage?
You've just got time for a nice little chuck-up.
Go to blazes.
- You're late.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't like being kept waiting by house surgeons.
You ought to know that.
What's the matter?
You look like a dog's dinner.
A decayed one at that.
- I'm all right, sir.
- How's that kidney I yanked out yesterday?
As well as can be expected, sir.
- Not sure I like that remark.
- Sorry, sir, I only...
Don't!
I'm the finest kidney-yanker in Harley Street, and don't forget it.
Sister!
- Yes, Sir Lancelot?
- Where have you been lurking?
You're too old to be bashful.
Leave it to probationers.
Who's in charge of dressings?
- I am, Sir Lancelot.
- Oh.
Are you?
Well, don't go on shoving yards and yards of bandage under my nose like you did last time.
We're not in the embalming business!
And, Sister, for God's sake see I get the right-sized needle.
When I want to sew up a patient, I want to sew him up, not do embroidery on his navel.
You'll find everything's in order, Sir Lancelot.
I sincerely hope so.
I suppose you've all heard I'm retiring?
- I thought that'd shake you.
After 30 years in the butchery business, I've had enough.
Someone else can take over the firm.
I'm sure we're all very sorry to hear it, Sir Lancelot.
Fiddlestick s, my good woman.
You're all tickled pink.
Aren't you, Dr. Burke?
Er, ye...
No, sir.
Don't lie to me, Dr. Burke.
And while I still am in charge, oblige me by not fondling my theatre staff's buttock s.
Thank you.
By the way, Hare...
Oh.
Give him another one!
What the devil is the matter with you today?
Morning, Susan.
- Good morning, Doctor.
- How's the occupational therapy?
- Wonderful!
- You wouldn't like a private patient, I suppose?
The whole hospital knows your idea of occupation, Doctor.
- I just thought I'd see how you are.
- Oh.
- Now, what's it say?
- Oh, I'm all right.
102?
!
That really is a hangover.
I didn't have a drink last night.
No?
I'll tell you what, old man.
- Hm?
- You're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.
- Good Lord!
- What?
It's half past eleven.
Psychosomatic, I'm sure of it.
Inattention.
- What's on your mind, Richard?
- Murder.
What did I tell you?
Clear out and let me talk to him.
You psychos.
This is a blood condition.
It's obvious.
We'll take a pint or two out and get a squint at it.
- No, you don't!
You're not taking my blood!
- It's obvious he ought to have a barium meal.
- Barium meal?
What for?
- Dr. Spencer would want a barium meal.
Dr. Spencer would want a barium meal for a slipped disc.
- You must have a bottle somewhere, Richard.
- Bottle?
I'm not treating you lot to drink s!
Not a full one, an empty one.
We ought to have a specimen.
I'll find something.
- What's going on?
- How did you know anything was going on?
It's all over the hospital.
Can I help?
- You?
You're a ruddy gynecologist.
- Well, you never know.
When I'm changing my sex, I'll send you a postcard.
Keep your hair on.
- I'm keeping everything on!
- Oh!
Could you just cough up a few dreams for us, Richard?
Good grief!
Do you know something?
Either you're dead or I've got a puncture.
I don't care!
Please go away and just leave me!
- You're just an ungrateful patient!
- Please go!
Yes, all right.
Don't push, cock, we all want a gander.
I say, I'm terribly sorry, sir.
What is this, the wake?
I'm a little off color, sir.
So I gather.
I don't know what you feel like but you look positively revolting.
Yes, sir.
You seem to be surrounded by a number of my colleagues.
Possibly I might have the benefit of their opinions.
- Dr. Burke?
- Er, well...
Yes, sir, erm...
I don't know, sir.
There's...
There's a fever, and...
- a temperature of 102.
- Coming up nicely to the boil, eh?
Yes, sir.
The patient complains of not feeling awfully well, sir.
So I've come to the conclusion that he's definitely... ill.
Very concise and helpful.
What about you, madam?
Oh, well...
I wouldn't like to commit myself without a test.
But I suspect a chronic duodenal ulcer.
It's all psychosomatic.
The patient is the victim of inner tensions caused by who knows what.
Possibly an incestuous mother wish creating deep guilt feelings.
Hence the conflict.
The patient feels nausea.
And not the only one to feel that around here at this moment.
Stick out your tongue.
Not you!
You, Hare.
Most rash request of mine.
Veil it decently, man.
Any of you other gentlemen care to enter the discussion?
Here we are.
Just let the dog see the rabbit.
- Tell me, is your father still alive?
- Yes, sir.
Is he a Chinaman?
Chinaman?
No, sir.
h that case, it should be obvious, even to a stringhalt, spavined, one-eyed village chemist, that the patient is suffering from jaundice, common yellow jaundice.
That'll be five guineas.
Good morning, good morning!
- How are you feeling?
- Much better.
- Splendid.
Now, would you like a nice book?
- No, thank s.
I've got one.
Oh...
Oh, good-oh.
Well, I'll be round again tomorrow.
- Are you having a nice rest?
- Yes, yes.
That's the ticket.
Well, I'll push in again tomorrow and...
see if I can tempt you.
Thank you.
Now... you'd like to make a nice pink bunny, wouldn't you?
I beg your pardon?
You take these pieces of felt and stitch them together.
I'll show you how.
And there you have a nice pink bunny.
No, thank s very much.
I really think I'd rather read.
Or I have some raffia.
You could make a pretty basket.
No, thank you.
Not a lovely basket?
No, thank you.
All I want is to be left alone.
Oh, you are a crosspatch, aren't you?
I shall have to talk to Sister about you.
Basket!
- Would you like a bottle.
Doctor?
- Oh, for heaven's...
It's you.
How are you feeling?
Oh, fine, but bored stiff.
You poor lad.
I could have brought you a much more interesting book than this.
I'm a bit short of the necessary.
- So am I.
- Ah, yes, of course.
You've been here eight days now.
This is the time when the young male patients begin to feel their oats.
How are the nurses?
Hello.
Good evening.
I thought I'd just come over and give you the details of my case.
I'm afraid I've forgotten your name.
Florence Nightingale.
I'm terribly sorry.
Is it really?
My mother was a nurse and she had a one-track mind.
- I'm known as Sally.
- Sally.
Oughtn't you to be in bed?
Oh, Sister won't be back for hours.
Here, let me do that.
We don't want you getting marge over your lovely starched apron.
Nurse.
Do you mind!
- Oh, hello.
- What are you doing out of bed?
Well, being a member of the trade, I thought I could take a few liberties.
- I beg your pardon?
- Have you met our new night nurse?
I know Nurse Nightingale very well.
- Hello, Sally.
- Hello, Roger.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't know you'd met.
Well, you're the doctor.
If I'm still awake, do come and talk to me... after Dr. Hinxman has gone.
Now, look here, Sally.
There is a certain professional code...
Well, you've been ordered complete bed rest.
No getting up at all.
Bed rest?
Who said so?
Bed rest?
Who said so?
- Dr. Hinxman.
- But I'm practically cured.
Ours not to reason why, Doctor.
Yes, but bed rest.
That means bed...
Yes, I'm afraid so.
And three-hourly injections of vitamin C and a diet of soya flour soup.
Soya flour?
Would you like some... barley water?
I'd love some.
How are you feeling tonight?
A little overexcited.
Have you got a temperature?
Yes, I rather think I have now.
I dreamt about you last night.
Did you?
No, you wouldn't let me.
There's someone coming!
That was a near thing.
- Sally?
- Mm-hm?
When I get out of here, will you come to dinner with me one night?
I'd be careful if I were you.
Do say you'll come, Sally.
Just the two of us, like now.
No question of dodging muscle-bound clots of house doctors.
Clot?
!
Oh, Sally.
"Oh, Sally"?
Huh!
I am not having any turpentine enemas!
- Oh?
- No.
Well, better talk to Dr. Hinxman about that.
Yes.
Now, what is all this damned nonsense?
You swine!
That's not a very professional way to address your colleague.
- I love Sally more than anything in the world.
- So do I.
I intend to marry her.
So, as it happens, do I.
Now, look here, Har...
Look har, Here...
I'm just an ordinary chap.
- I'm no screen lover, but...
- Ha!
...but I love Sally, and if you try to...
Well, I won't damn well stand for it, do you hear?
And I won't damn well stand for this.
I shall complain to Spratt when he comes round.
Sir Lancelot, I have a complaint to make.
So have I. I left a poker school to come and see you.
And I was winning too.
How is he?
It's very good of you, sir, but really...
- Will you shut up!
- He's very restless, sir.
We've tried all the usual sedatives but he's extremely resistant.
It's not that at all, sir!
Keep your trap shut.
You know nothing about your case.
No doctor does as a patient.
- But I'm perfectly well, sir!
- As you see, sir, he definitely needs sedating.
I'll get the physician to give you something to knock you out.
And if you don't take it.
I'll give you something to make Sleeping Beauty look like a case of galloping insomnia!
- Come on, Hinxman.
- Very good, sir.
Richard?
Richard?
Richard.
Oh!
But you can't!
I mean, you can't marry a girl called Florence Nightingale.
- In fact, you can't marry anyone.
- You watch me.
It's lechery.
It's the starch, fight it.
Have an injection.
- Buy some Indian clubs or something.
- Tony, I love her.
We know all about that.
But you'll be out of a job in a couple of week s.
And so will I.
You won't be able to afford to have a wife.
You'll be lucky if you can afford a stethoscope, even on a party line.
Sally won't mind.
Anyway, something will turn up.
We'd better go and get cleaned up for old Spratt's farewell party.
Let me put it another way.
On the occasion of his retirement,
I ask you to drink to the long life and happiness of Sir Lancelot and his gracious lady.
ALL Sir Lancelot!
Sir Lancelot and Lady Spratt.
Thank you, Mr. Dean.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Personally, I'm delighted to retire.
However.
I've been asked to give advice to some of you young ones.
Get married as quickly as possible.
Most doctors marry nurses or other doctors or barmaids.
About the only women they meet socially.
It makes you respectable, saves you from amorous patients, prevents gossip, gets your telephone answered and is something to do on your evenings off.
Where's Richard?
- What's up?
- Sally.
She's gone off... with a man.
Besides, most men don't like a doctor mucking about with their wife unless the doctor himself has a wife at home.
She left this morning.
Put her resignation into Matron's letter box and went.
- It must have been Godfrey, I suppose.
- Godfrey?
The pilot with the virus pneumonia who was in last month.
Probably halfway to Rio by now.
Unless it was the BBC chap with the asthma.
He was keen on her.
No... the fellow with the shingles and the expense account.
Any other runners?
Plenty.
Well... there we are, then.
Just two scalps on a night nurse's belt.
Nicely starched, too.
Richard.
Spratt wants you.
Spratt's yelling for you.
Go on.
Oh.
- You wanted me, sir?
- Yes, Hare.
Let me introduce you to Dr. Cardew, a neighbor of mine in the country.
He's looking for a new assistant.
I told him you're the least incompetent of this cretinous bunch of nincompoops
- available at this slaughterhouse.
- Thank you, sir.
- Do you ride horses?
- Yes, a bit.
Oh, good.
My present chap's a dear boy, but he's inseparable from his scooter.
I think they cohabit.
Perhaps you'd care to dine with me at my club tonight and have a chat?
- I wouldn't need you for a few week s.
- Thank you very much.
- Lancelot?
- Good evening, Lady Spratt.
I think you ought to talk to Professor...
Your stomach's going to revel in that.
About another three week s, he said.
Well, take it.
How can I take it when my bleeding heart's broken?
You need to get away and relax.
I know just the place.
I'll go with you.
Take your mind off Florence Deadly Nightshade.
It won't cost us a penny, either.
This is a fine ruddy place you've brought me to.
You were saying?
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Do please sit down.
Now, for the benefit of you good people not already cognizant with the drill,
I intend to run the facts through for you quite briefly...
Good morning.
Now, we here are endeavoring through various experiments to pinpoint the causes of the common cold.
Do please listen to this.
Carefully.
Everybody.
It affects you all.
You will be subjected to the various cold viruses by means of inoculation and by other means.
And the results will be very carefully noted.
You will be segregated, in pairs... ...by sexes.
And it is a strict rule that you talk to nobody but your roommate and the staff.
How about that?
You and me, artistic disrobers, priestesses of the nude...
We're just plain strippers, dear.
Common!
...being asked to appear as performing guinea pigs.
Well, it's free.
At least we don't have to tramp around looking for a job for a fortnight.
Oww!
Oh-oh!
It's too hot!
- It's too hot!
Get it off!
- Turn it off!
Aagh!
Turn it off, we're freezing!
That's the spirit.
You're quite comfy.
Up, please.
I must say, one takes off one's hat to you two.
We've never had guinea pigs like you.
You must be terrifically resistant.
There's not a sign of a cold.
- Awfully sorry.
- You haven't come in here to be cold-free.
Personally, I've come here to be rent-free.
We must persevere, must we not?
- Block F now, I think, Professor.
- Oh, yes, rather.
Block F.
A most rewarding sight. 37 dripping noses.
Thank you.
- Good health.
- Good health.
It tastes like something you'd sit in to get rid of a tattoo.
- Coal?
- Coke?
Ice.
Oh, Christmas!
Doctors on the rocks.
Aagh, ooh!
Crikey!
After this, they ought to make us honorary brass monkeys!
What a dump.
It's free.
If you hadn't slapped that manager, we wouldn't have to be here.
I was engaged to pose in that place, not stooge for the comic.
Posing's artistic.
And I never caught a cold doing it and nor did you.
Well, I move about.
Besides, I wear more.
A couple of sequins, that's all.
Well, I'm bored.
I'm bored with nothing to look at except your ugly mug.
I resent that.
But I know what you mean, though.
- We need new faces.
- Female, preferably.
And why stop at faces?
Look.
- Oh, yes.
- But you know the rules.
I envy the doctors here.
At least they can go to the flick s.
Well, we're doctors too.
Yes.
We're doctors too, old man.
The assistant said, "I'm not blaming anyone. "
- But I said, "I am.
I'm blaming the fencer. "
- Yes, I know.
You told me.
Good after... noon.
I'm Dr. Burke and this is Dr. Hare.
Come in.
Excuse me.
I haven't seen you here before.
No, I've just come back off leave, actually, and my colleague here has only just joined the staff.
- Haven't you?
- Hm?
Oh... yes.
How are you, ladies?
- Fed up.
- Oh.
Couldn't you play draughts or something?
We have enough draughts when we're working, thank you.
We'll have to see what we can do.
I brought something for you to take.
Oh, not more germs?
Nice ones, this time.
One more germ in me and they won't have room to park.
Smells like gin.
Gin?
How extraordinary.
Doesn't it?
I couldn't tell if it was neat carbolic.
Yes, well, we often notice that.
A bad head cold has the most extraordinary effect on the... olfactory and gustatory nerves.
The what?
- The pong.
- Oh.
Dr. Flower, come on!
Dr. Burke?
Still resisting strongly.
You know, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever clapped stethoscope on.
Silly!
No, I mean it.
I mean it, honestly.
Now, tell me more about yourself.
Bare your soul.
My soul?
No-one's ever asked to see that before!
- Do you like being a doctor?
- Oh, yes.
What do you do?
Research, mostly.
Oh, how you must have suffered for your art.
It must have been dreadful giving six shows a day at The Windmill.
Oh, it was.
Just think, being stuck in that dreary place 12 hours nonstop.
I couldn't do anything, go anywhere.
You poor child.
Yes.
We used to call it "the prison without bras".
I... hope you're covered by insurance in your work.
It's about all we are covered by!
How's your cold?
Oh, I don't notice it.
I'm getting tiddly!
You know...
Dawn and me were fed to the teeth with this fortnight.
But things are looking up now.
And it's not over yet, darling.
Tell me...
Have you ever broken your clavicles?
- Broken?
- Mm-hm.
They aren't breakable, are they?
No, darling...
No, your clavicles are your collarbones.
Oh, I see!
What do you do in your act?
- I'm a canary.
- A what?
A canary.
I come onto the stage all covered in feathers.
Then what?
I molt!
- Oh, Professor, excuse me.
- Hello.
But there's something you ought to know.
It's about those young ladies.
I was passing the hut and, er...
Oh, come on!
Don't flab.
Well, I heard the most extraordinary noises.
And I rather got the impression that they're not isolated.
And this was thrown from the window.
Now, come on, girls.
Show us what you really do in the show.
I tell you, we can't.
- We haven't got our costumes here.
- We'll imagine those.
We must have our costumes.
Oh, couldn't you make do with bottle tops or something?
Oh, don't be so inartistic!
Bottle tops!
I'm sorry.
I was only trying to be helpful.
I suppose we could give them an idea.
That wouldn't be difficult.
Oh, come on.
You were the one who was feeling homesick.
A workout would do you good.
Not in bottle tops, it wouldn't.
Well... you could find something.
Oh, all right.
But we'll have to get ready and rehearse.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
Now turn round and don't look.
- Don't look.
- Certainly.
- Where are you going?
- We'll wait in here.
They need sterilizing.
Good afternoon, ladies.
And how are we feeling?
- Never felt better.
- Oh, really?
With a cold?
What cold?
The wonderful new germs we've been having.
Ritchie MacDarling.
PROFESSOR:
Will you kindly explain?
Well...
May one ask where you ladies obtained this?
Never mind that.
You're just in time for the show, darling.
- No, please.
- Sit down.
Oh, don't be shy.
It's artistic.
The Rokeby Venus.
Dr. Flower.
- Isolate yourself this instant.
- Yes, Professor, of course.
I insist on knowing where you got this from.
- Doctors brought it.
- What doctors?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Where are they now, might one ask?
Sterilizing themselves.
This is disgraceful.
It's monstrous!
I have never known such crass infringement of the rules.
BOTH Crass infringement of the rules.
It's an orgy!
An orgy?
!
At-choo!
Come on, darling.
Come and lie on the bed with us.
Isn't he gorgeous?
What depravity.
You evil men!
Get up, Dr. Flower.
- Stop this horseplay.
- Oh, Professor.
I suppose you ladies realize that you've violated our strictest rule?
- We never touched him.
- What are you going to do, report us to Equity?
Pack up, please, and leave the establishment instantly.
You've ruined our entire research on you.
Cut along, Dr. Flower, and adjust your dress.
Stop it!
Rokeby Venus!
Aberdeen Angus!
Good luck, cock.
- It's been lovely.
- Bye-bye.
Hope the new show comes up to scratch.
As long as the audience don't, it'll be OK.
Watch out for the germs, doc.
- Bye-bye.
- Oh.
He's lovely.
Bye!
Bye!
It's Dr. Hare, isn't it?
- Yes.
- We were expecting you.
- Dr. Cardew is in the study.
- Oh, thank you.
At-choo!
- Have you got a cold, Doctor?
- Just recovering.
Do you have injections?
I always do.
Never a sniff the whole winter long.
I'm Wildewinde.
- You're what?
- Wildewinde, it's my name.
You'll see a lot of me.
I'm the receptionist, and the dispenser, and look after the forms.
A real universal aunt, as it were.
I do hope you'll be happy here, Doctor.
We are a pleasant little community, healthy too.
Graveled soil, you know.
But we have enough to keep us busy.
Anything you want, but anything, just call for Wildewinde.
This way, Doctor.
- Dr. Hare, Doctor.
- Do forgive me, I didn't hear the bell.
- Thank you, Wildewinde.
Oh, this is Wildewinde.
- The Doctor and I have already... broken the ice.
I really must apologize for Wildewinde.
I took him over with the furniture and never got round to dislodging him.
- He's rather dreadful, but he cleans leather well.
- According to him, he does everything well.
Including getting plastered from time to time.
But only very quietly on his days off.
One hopes.
Have a look at those X-rays.
You'd never think that was the pelvic girdle of a field marshal, would you?
- Rather decorative in a way, aren't they?
- He certainly cracked it.
Yes, poor chap.
Run over by his own lawn mower.
Still, we'll have him leaping around in time.
Mrs. Blewer says lunch in ten minutes, sir.
Oh, and a Mrs. Tadwich rang up for attention.
Tadwich?
Is she on the book s?
No, Doctor.
A newcomer to the fold.
This afternoon I've got to cheer up the Field Marshal, see the Hunt Secretary and be at the college hospital at four.
Quarter to, Doctor.
I think you'd better see that Tadwich, Richard, if you can bear to.
Nothing like breaking the ice, Wildewinde.
Mrs. Tadwich?
I'm Dr. Hare.
You telephoned, I think.
Oh, yes.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
I wasn't expecting you so early.
Well, we usually try and see our new patients first.
You live alone here?
Just Rénée and I.
Mr. Tadwich left.
There's a divorce pending.
- Sorry.
- Shall we go into the bedroom?
Er, no, I...
I don't think that will be necessary, Mrs. Tadwich.
Now, then, what appears to be the trouble?
Well... it's my heart, Doctor.
It's my heart.
I see.
What are the symptoms?
Oh, I don't have symptoms, I have palpitations.
It's a problem heart, you know.
Really?
Well, that's what the specialist said.
I get this... strange tremor... right in the middle of my chest.
- No other manifestation of the condition?
- I'm sorry?
Oh, I mean, is that all?
They said at the hospital it wasn't serious, but... well...
I'd like you to examine me.
Certainly, Mrs. Tadwich.
But, you see, it's really not quite correct for me to...
That's all right, Rénée's here.
Oh, well, in that case...
It sounds like an idiopathic condition to me, no cause for alarm.
That's good.
Well, I'm going to palpate the vibrations in your cardiac area first.
Oh, yes, I can feel a distinct thrill.
Well, we're all human, aren't we, Doctor?
How about coming round one evening for a drink?
- I really don't think so.
- There's Rénée outside.
Would you open the door for her?
Yes, certainly.
I'll be glad of her presence.
Yes, when that dog walked in, I could feel the entire Medical Council breathing down my neck.
I don't blame you.
It's happened to me.
Very tricky, sometimes.
Still, you know the old rule.
It's all right to make a patient out of your mistress, but not a mistress out of your patient.
I'll remember that.
Of course...
Another wig for Mr. Mencroft?
He must smoke them.
Of course, old Spratt was right the other evening.
A doctor is safer if he's married.
- Have you ever been?
- From time to time.
My present wife's in California.
Poor darling, she couldn't bear the smell of ether.
She's got the smog now.
You should try marriage, Richard.
It's quite enjoyable, you know, while it lasts.
- I've just recently been rather badly let down.
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
There are plenty of pretty girls in this neighborhood if you want to try again.
Choose the one with the prettiest legs.
It's as good a way as any.
An emergency case, Doctor.
- Mrs. Mimp's little boy in the surgery.
- What's wrong?
He's lost his head.
Oh, what have I said?
Now, just you sit quiet till the doctor comes, or I'll give you such a smack.
What do you say?
Speak up, I can't hear you.
You're running him in blinkers this season, I see, Mrs. Mimp.
We've tried everything, Doctor.
- How did he get in?
- He's a greedy little boy.
Always was.
May I suggest a tin opener, sir?
Look s like a plumbing job to me.
Carry on, Richard.
I've got an idea.
All right.
Now, then, Wildewinde, you hold the neck of the bottle.
Ow.
Ooh.
Then after I'd got rid of the pimples, I got the hot flushes.
And then to top it all, I woke up one morning and my voice had broken.
Yes, but surely, Mr. Green, all this happened when you were a boy?
Oh, no, last week.
- Last week?
- Yes.
How old are you, Mr. Green?
28.
And I'm right, aren't I, Doctor?
It's arrived, hasn't it?
- What?
- Manhood.
- Well...
- I thought so.
When my landlady's daughter brings me up my early morning tea, I get a very funny feeling.
Yes, well, I shouldn't worry about that, Mr. Green.
I'll give you a tonic.
Now.
Can you come round this evening and collect it?
Yes, Doctor, but not after seven, because I'm taking my landlady's daughter on a ramble.
On second thoughts, I think I'll make that a sedative.
Right, now remember, Mr. Green, take it easy.
You're not very strong, you know.
Oh, no.
No, that's right...
I'm not.
Thank you, Doctor.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Wildewinde?
Coming, Doctor!
Make this up for Mr. Green, will you, please?
Good heavens!
- What's the matter?
- I can read it.
The first time in 15 years.
Congratulations, Doctor.
Wildewinde, I'm off to the hospital.
Has Lord Cornbilly's truss arrived yet?
On your desk, sir, with the seed catalogue you ordered.
- Anything new, Richard?
- No, but there's a call for you from California
- at 4.30 this afternoon.
- California?
Yeah.
Put the truss in the bus, Wildewinde.
Oh, yes, sir.
My dear, I really have only the haziest notion of what you've been saying for the last 20 minutes.
Perhaps it's the smog your end.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Try turning the telephone round the other way.
Look, I think I'd better fly out.
I'll cable you.
All right.
Goodbye, my dear.
Poor thing.
She was never very articulate at the best of times.
Are you going away?
I think I must.
She's in some hopeless muddle about our divorce.
Will you be away long?
Some week s, I'm afraid.
Do you think you can manage?
- Well, I'll do my best.
- There's nothing much on... except the Field Marshal, and he only needs his hand holding from time to time.
We'll get you an assistant.
I'll ring the hospitals now.
Oh, I'll go.
Wildewinde's out.
- I want a London call, please.
- London?
Finish your sandwich first.
Good evening, Doctor.
I'm collecting for the county hospital.
- Tony!
- Got any women patients you don't want?
Still living up to your name, I see.
Do you want a job?
- A job?
Well...
- Come on in, you've got one.
Down here.
Could the doctor see a nasty nosebleed?
Ohh!
I wish you wouldn't do that, Doctor!
I nearly dropped my forceps.
Wildewinde, nip into the dispensary and fix me up with a nice gin and bismuth, will you?
- Certainly not, Doctor!
- Wildewinde... here are the forms.
How are things today?
A bronchitis, a couple of impetigo, measles...
and a puncture.
A lumbar puncture?
No, a nearside front puncture.
My old bus has just about had it.
- How's trade here?
Oh, a bit slackish.
You know, you've got to attract the customers, just like any other business.
How about putting an ad in the local rag?
"Handsome young doctor wishes to meet attractive female patient with a view to an operation. "
- Doctor, think of the ethics!
- To hell with the ethics.
Think of the fun!
"Madam, if your appendix isn't doing anything on Saturday evening, I'd love to take it out. "
I'm not kidding.
Really.
We do need a gimmick of some kind.
- Such as?
- I don't know.
How about putting Wildewinde in the window with a beautiful hand-sewn scar on his tum?
That ought to bring 'em in.
Now I have dropped my forceps!
Dr. Hare?
Yes?
Here she is, sir.
Lovely job, eh?
It's beautiful.
Perhaps you'd like a run-around in her, see the performance?
That's very kind, but I don't really...
I congratulate you on your choice, sir.
What's money when it's a job like this, eh?
What indeed?
My choice?
- Ordered in your name, sir.
- I never ordered this!
Come, sir, it's too late to have second thoughts.
I have documents here.
Just a minute, I'll be right back.
- Dr. Hare?
- Get all this stuff out of here!
Out?
But that other doctor ordered it!
What the devil?
What's going on here?
Doctor's orders, sir.
Tony!
What do you think of it, eh?
American methods.
Give the place some zing.
Would you mind signing that, please?
- Very nice.
What about that car outside?
- It's come, has it?
Oh, good.
It'll add an air to the practice, don't you think?
All we need is a nice sexy receptionist and we're all set.
Set for what, bankruptcy?
Have you any idea what these things cost?
- Sexy receptionists?
- No, you stupid idiot, the car!
You don't have to worry about things like that.
We'll get it off the income tax.
Tony, have you got any idea what the income of this practice is?
You're being a bit reactionary, aren't you?
- It's fatal for a young doctor.
- Look here, Tony...
Wildewinde?
You're not leaving.
Are you?
I am indeed, Doctor.
I will stay no longer in a practice where this sort of thing is attached to my door.
Ooh, this is much better than the Palais.
Yes, it's certainly more intimate.
I didn't think doctors did this sort of thing.
Well, given half a chance, doctors will do every sort of thing.
Saucy!
Do you like me, Kitten?
Yes, I do.
Your cha-cha's real cool.
Oh.
You know, you're wasted in a shop like...
Jennifer Modes?
Yes, we must find something more worthy for you.
Excuse me, Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Hello, Burke here.
No, no, Dr. Burke.
Good evening, Doctor.
I believe you are on the rota as police surgeon this week.
Oh, am I?
Well, if you say so.
We traced you from your home.
We've got a case here...
Drunk!
That... is a slanderous statement!
I'm wanted by the police.
- Why, what have you done?
- Well, nothing yet... unfortunately.
You stay there.
I'll be back.
Don't talk to a soul.
I'll run over you for fingerprints when I return.
He was being most difficult in the high street, sir.
The constable simply had to bring him in.
I was merely expressing a desire... to see my dear old mother!
You were... to music.
I happen to be possessed of a true countertenor voice.
I could make a fortune on the telly.
All right, thank you.
Just keep blowing.
Keep blowing, sir.
I wish to see... my own medical attendant.
- All right, sir.
Dr. Hare will be here in a minute.
- Dr. Hare?
Here you are, Doctor.
Now you test it for alcoholic content.
Oh.
Doctor!
What have you been drinking, Wildewinde?
Esso Extra?
The Leith Police dismisseth us.
What?
The Leith Police dismisseth us.
It's the next test.
Try it, Doctor.
The Leith Polith...
These Police...
The Leith Polith...
Ahem.
Wildewinde, I'm supposed to be examining you.
And now the finger test.
Watch, everyone.
BURKE Jolly good.
Dead centre.
And I did not peep.
What next, Doctor?
And now we go walkie-walkies.
Wildewinde knows.
BURKE See, Wildewinde knows.
That's awfully good, Wildewinde.
I can do better than that.
Watch.
Sir, come down!
Shush.
Oh, Doctor!
Thank goodness you've come.
They all think Wildewinde's intoxicated.
And is he?
Look, Richard!
No hands.
Sir!
Tony, come down!
Tony, you're going to hurt yourself.
Careful, you're going to break something!
Tony!
No, George, I didn't fire him and he didn't quit.
He's in hospital with a broken arm.
Well, can't you please send me an assistant before I go clean round the bend?
I can't think of anyone from here, but I'll scout around the others and see.
Any particular kind?
If he's qualified and has reasonable ethics...
All right, then.
You'll do your best, George?
Yes, thanks.
Bye.
Oh.
Would you...
Would you mind waiting in the waiting room?
- I'm not a patient.
I want to see the doctor.
- Well, that's me.
No, the other one with the bow tie and the hot eyes.
Oh, you mean Dr. Burke?
I'm afraid he's temporarily unavailable.
What a shame.
When I met him at the club, he told me there was a receptionist job going.
Did he?
As a matter of fact, there is.
Tell me, what are your qualifications, Miss...?
Strudwick.
Well, I'm a very good secretary and I'm learning to type.
I've been with Jennifer Modes for a year.
I see.
Well, do sit down, Miss Strudwick.
Now you want to make a change, is that it?
There's nothing like variety.
The other doctor said it was living in.
He said it would be nice for him to have me in easy reach.
In case of emergencies.
Yes, I see.
Come back next week, Mr. Luke.
You bet I will, Doctor!
Next patient, please.
One at a time, please.
- Telephone, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes, this is Doctor Barrington.
Yes, I do want some experience in general practice.
How do I know I'd be right for him?
An African witch doctor would be all right from the way he's talking.
I'll give you the address and you can let him know.
As soon as you can make it.
All right.
Bye.
I said next week, Mr. Luke.
Couldn't I come before?
You're doing me the power of good, Doctor.
I'm afraid I shan't be here.
Oh?
Who will be, then?
Dr. Harvey will look after you.
Dr. Harvey?
Next patient, please.
I think you'll find it's all pretty simple.
h here we keep the patients' file cards.
You fill in a new card for each new patient and keep it up to date.
And in here we have the application blank s for... oh, glasses, teeth, wigs and appliances.
Quite a palaver, isn't it?
Well, I'm sure you'll quite soon get the hang of it.
And in here, we have the secret and confidential files.
Yes, well...
Dr. Burke was very interested in anatomy.
Yes, wasn't he?
You wouldn't know he was a doctor.
But I ought to have guessed.
He had such lovely soft hands... when he cha-cha'd.
Yes.
Well, now, let's get on, Miss Strudwick.
Why don't you call me Kitten?
Everyone does.
Oh, I think for professional reasons we'll keep it as Miss Strudwick.
You're one of the shy sort, aren't you?
Not like Dr. Burke.
Yes.
- Well, time for surgery.
- Oh.
- Oh, a telegram arrived for you over the phone.
- Oh.
Yes?
"Arriving 545 tomorrow to act as assistant if agreeable...
- Thank goodness.
... Nicholas Barrington. " Nicholas.
Mmm, I like that name.
Oh, good.
Well, perhaps he cha-cha-chas.
Yeah.
Oh, good afternoon.
I have an appointment with the other doctor.
- Me too.
- So do I.
Really?
Oh, I bet you cha-cha-cha.
Cha-cha-cha?
Yes.
Well, I'm awfully sorry, ladies, but I'm afraid the job's gone.
So has the other doctor.
But I can cha-cha!
Terribly sorry.
So sorry.
One job, one girl.
That's the way it is.
I'm terribly sorry.
- But the job really has gone.
Oh, no.
Not another one!
I'm afraid you've wasted your time.
The job's gone.
- Gone?
- Yes, it's Dr. Burke's fault.
He's left, too.
- Awfully sorry.
- But I've come from London!
London?
What's he playing at?
I don't know.
I've never met him.
Never m...
Oh, but don't you cha-cha-cha?
Cha-cha-cha?
Sometimes, at hospital dances.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
You've come instead of Dr. Barrington.
No.
No?
I am.
You...
Nicholas?
Nicola.
Oh...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, don't worry.
It's always happening.
When I arrived as a student at St. Savior's, they put me down for a lodge meeting and a rugger trial.
Do you mind a woman assistant?
No, not at all.
Would you like a cigarette?
It's all right, I...
- have my own.
- Yes, I'm sure you have.
Well, now, my boss, Dr. Cardew, is away in California for the time being.
You'll have his room and there's a secretary who lives in, too.
Are you married?
No.
When do we start?
- Start?
- Work.
Oh, yes, work.
Well, right away.
Oh, well, just give me a second to unpack.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.
Er, Miss Strudwick, Dr. Barrington.
And I'm the minister of health!
Pleased to meet you.
You know, you're making quite a hit in this town.
All the patients are asking for you.
Yes, but most of them are men and they want to examine me.
They look on me as some sort of freak.
Oh, I wouldn't call you that.
Well, women doctors are still rather novelties.
Yes, I expect there's a bit of gossip.
Anyway, that's why I want to go halves tonight.
Let's have dinner and I'll tell you about my symptoms.
Symptoms?
What symptoms?
Well every time I look into your eyes, I have an irresistible desire to kiss you.
What do you think I should do about that?
Well, good night.
Good night, Nicky.
I enjoyed that.
So did I.
- Very much.
- We must do it again.
On the National Health next time.
Good night.
Good night.
I thought you might like to see the new copy of The Lancet.
Oh.
Thank you.
Just in case you can't sleep.
I shall sleep.
Well, I don't feel very sleepy.
Try.
You've got to work tomorrow.
- Yes.
- Good night.
Night.
Oh, er... you haven't such a thing as a sleeping pill, have you?
There are lots in the drug cupboard.
Yes, I know, but I...
I seem to have lost my key.
Oh.
Well, I've got some Aspro.
Oh, they'll be fine.
- It's a... nuisance when you can't sleep, isn't it?
- Mm.
I thought I might make myself a hot drink later.
- Good idea.
- Would you like one now?
No, thank s.
- Here you are.
- Oh.
Thank you.
- Did...
Did you read that Lancet?
- Not yet.
There's an article in it on heart stimulation.
I'd like to discuss it with you.
Fine... in the morning.
Yes.
Well, er... good night.
Good night.
Night.
Mmm...
Oh...
Come in.
I saw your light was still on.
What is it?
I was wondering if you had such a thing as a saucepan.
No.
What for?
Well, I wanted to make myself that hot drink and I can't find one.
Well, there must be one in the kitchen somewhere.
I can't see one.
Oh, all right.
I'll come and look.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
I'm...
I'm sorry to trouble you.
It's all right.
Your insomnia's rather sudden, isn't it?
- Oh, no, I'm a...
I'm a martyr to it.
- Hm.
I'll make a couple of drink s and bring you up one, shall I?
An early morning cup of tea would be more suitable.
- Well, whatever you like.
- There must be a saucepan somewhere.
You'd think so, but I can't find one anywhere.
Are you quite sure you looked?
I'm so sorry to trouble you at this time of night, Doctor, but he's done it again.
Your problem is solved.
Good night, Doctor.
All right, Mrs. Mason, don't worry.
I'll come round later this evening.
- Yes, goodbye.
- Would you see Harold, please?
Mr. Harold Green, I mean.
Who?
Oh, yes.
Er... in the surgery, please.
No, I think here would be better.
He's got something on his mind.
Oh.
Hello, Mr. Green.
All right, thank you, Miss Strudwick.
Oh, I think he'd rather I stayed.
You see, we're getting married.
So I've got to know the worst.
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- I suppose it means you'll want to leave us now.
- When it's convenient.
Harold would like to talk to you, Doctor.
Yes, of course.
Do sit down.
Thank you, Doctor.
Well, um...
I would like for you to give my spouse and self a talk.
A talk?
Yes... a frank talk.
Oh, you mean about...
Yes.
Well, I'd have thought that your espoused was more qualified...
I mean...
We're all ears, Doctor.
Well, as you know, in marriage there's a man and a woman and possibly children.
- There's nothing to it, really.
- But I'm naturally concerned about our relations.
I don't think they'd worry about a few children.
Oh, I wasn't referring to those relations, Doctor.
Oh, no.
Quite.
Well, there's some very good books on the subject.
I know a couple who read one of those.
Didn't they find it helpful?
All I know is, the man turned up to work the next day with a fractured ankle.
Yes.
Well, you have to follow the instructions rather carefully.
As a matter of fact, I think we have some excellent literature on the subject over here.
It puts things very clearly.
Oh.
Excuse me.
I think this tells you all you need to know.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yes?
Yes, all right.
I'll be round this evening.
Oh!
Oh, no!
Goodbye.
I don't think Harold's quite ready for this yet, Doctor.
- I'm frightfully sorry.
- Oh!
Wagstaff Hall, Cornwall Street.
Now, where the devil is that?
Leave it to me, dear.
Why you want to let me in for attending this damn lecture I don't know.
I should be pruning the roses.
I was thinking of the roses, dear.
You're apt to confuse pruning with amputating.
Mind that damn bus, woman!
Bar's open.
It's just over there.
I'll pick you up when I've done my shopping.
All right, dear.
And while you're at it, get a case of Glen Grant whisky.
I shall need reviving.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
- Hello, Billet.
- Hello, Lancelot.
- I didn't think this was your meat.
- Well, I...
They say...
I hope they've got something interesting.
I didn't come all this way for kindergarten stuff.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me, sir, are you a member?
Member?
I'm a member of everything, though God knows why at my age.
May I see your card, then, sir?
I'm Sir Lancelot Spratt, past president of the Royal College of Surgeons.
I don't carry cards.
A doctor?
Well, is somebody ill, sir?
There'll be somebody at the gates of death hammering for admission if you don't let me in.
Cor, you ain't half got a big head.
- I know you.
You're Burke.
- Yes, sir.
Since when did you take an interest in this sort of thing?
Since I was a very little boy, I think, sir.
I'm surprised to see you.
I'm a bit surprised to see you, sir.
How did you do that?
I lost my balance, sir.
Hm.
I don't see any of the familiar faces here.
Usually these lectures are crammed with the whole General Medical Council.
May I say how gratifying it is to see such a large and distinguished gathering here today?
I miss one or two faces, but no doubt urgent business has prevented them from coming.
What time's this damn thing start?
I could do with a drink.
I think that may be a good idea, sir.
It's very civilized having a bar.
I can see myself enjoying this.
I very much hope you're right, sir.
Good God!
Where the hell am I?
The Haystack, sir.
It's a club.
I can see it's not a Women's Institute.
Now, before I show these slides which illustrate our discovery,
I should just like to sketch in the background of my work which led up to it.
And now The Haystack Club takes great pleasure in presenting the lovely, luscious, lovable Leonora, in famous pictures by famous painters.
First, The Rokeby Venus... by Velázquez.
I know you.
Oi!
Where do you think you're going?
I sliced you up at St. Swithin's a couple of years ago.
- I never forget a face.
- Why, it's Sir Lancelot.
Well, isn't it nice?
MAN Chuck him out!
Silence!
Haven't you got any manners?
What puzzles me is what you've done with the scar.
There's no scar, Sir Lancelot.
It was my tonsils you took out.
So it was.
Very good thing for you in your job!
Sir... young man...
It's all right, keep calm.
Just a routine check on membership.
The police!
Quick, this way.
Put her down!
You're not a paid-up member.
Come on.
There's a street door on the other side.
We'll show you.
Beasts such as these distinguished highland gentlemen were often pursued by hairy old monsters like these.
Bravo!
Breathing better, aren't I, Doctor?
All right, get dressed.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Nicky.
Oh, Richard, I'm glad you're there.
Listen, I'm up in New Town.
Well, there's a case up here, a child.
No, it's pretty serious.
Can you come and have a look?
Yes, all right.
What's the address?
- Well?
- Temperature's up.
- To what?
- 104.
Is he vomiting?
Mm.
He started a little while ago.
Well, there's a chap called Deakin who's been working on a new serum.
It's not generally available yet.
- I'll have to telephone to London.
- OK.
All right.
I'm glad you called me, Nicky.
I'm afraid your little boy's rather ill, Mrs. Parker.
But he's...
He's going to be all right, isn't he, Doctor?
Well, children have a great deal of resistance.
It's probably only flu.
These damn schools don't look after 'em.
No, I'm afraid it's rather more serious than that.
Well, you're a doctor, aren't you?
Well, do something, then.
But I've got to have it, sir.
Yes, I know, but Dr. Deakin's out of England now.
Look, sir, this is a very urgent case.
I appreciate that you think that, Dr. Hare.
But this particular drug is highly dangerous.
I cannot accept the responsibility of releasing it without Dr. Deakin's approval.
I suggest you try and contact him.
Good night.
But, Dr. Mincing, I...
Hello?
Mincing?
Yes, I know the perisher.
One of the Creator's less appetizing efforts.
What do you want me to do about it all?
If you could speak to him, sir, use your influence.
Can't any of you get it into your heads I've retired?
There's no need to shout, Lancelot.
The servants know.
Well, thank God somebody does.
This new drug...
I haven't bothered to keep up with them all, too busy.
Will it work?
I don't know, sir.
It's the only hope.
You realize you may be making a bloody fool of yourself?
I don't mind that.
But you may be asking me to make a fool of myself!
I know, sir, but I'm thinking about the patient.
I don't care about anything else.
Very well.
And heaven help you if you're wrong.
- I've got his telephone number here, sir.
- I don't need it.
I'll play this my own way.
- Where's the key to the garage?
- Where it always is.
May I remind you that we've got the Lord Lieutenant coming to dinner?
Oh, tell the old fool I've bust my braces and gone to bed.
Come on, Hare.
Keep your ruddy Russian salad off the Queen's highway, you blasted oaf!
I've already told Dr. Hare the drug is still on the experimental list.
If you'd care to try and contact Dr. Deakin, you may use this telephone.
He's gadding about on the continent.
This is urgent.
- I cannot release it without authority.
- I'm giving you it!
I'm afraid that's hardly sufficient, Sir Lancelot.
May I remind you you've retired?
A great loss to medicine, I'm sure.
But no doubt you felt that it was necessary to give way to younger men.
I want that drug, Mincing.
I've already given you the explanation, Sir Lancelot.
I have an overwhelming desire, Mincing, to lay you flat and slit your throat and I may yield to it!
If you threaten me, Sir Lancelot, I shall be compelled to have you removed, by the police.
The police, you miserable wet nurse?
They'd help me sharpen the knife!
But the attendant publicity wouldn't be very agreeable.
That is, of course, so.
To call the operator, just ask for Continental Enquiries.
Thank you.
Give me Fleet Street 8000, the night editor, please.
When you reach my age, with one foot in the grave, publicity doesn't mean anything.
But for a younger man...
Just a moment, Sir Lancelot.
Ever noticed how the press are inclined to pull out all the stops for a sick child?
- This is hardly ethical, Sir Lancelot.
- I gave that up when I retired.
It's a great relief.
Hello, Cudliffe?
Lancelot Spratt.
How's the ulcer?
Good.
Now, listen.
There's a ca...
Get out of my lap!
This isn't a necking party.
There's a red light, sir.
I haven't stopped at a red light since Port Said in 1920.
I have to warn you there are certain risk s attached to this.
I need your permission to try.
- Well, of course, Doctor.
- Thank you.
- Well, I don't like it.
- Oh, for God's sake!
They're just mucking about.
I'll make a complaint about this.
That kid should be in hospital.
All you doctors are the same.
Using the kid as a ruddy guinea pig.
Now, you listen to me, Parker.
While you and I are talking in here, your son's dying.
Now, I think that this can save him.
If I'm wrong, you can make it as hot for me as you like afterwards.
But it won't bring him back.
There's just a chance that this can help.
I wish I didn't have to ask for your permission to give him this injection, but I do.
So I'll ask you once more.
Do I have it?
Oh, all right.
Do what you like.
Well, we won't be absolutely certain for another couple of hours.
You may as well go home and try and get some rest.
- OK.
- I predict he'll go to sleep now.
Aah!
I am so sorry.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
- What do you want?
- Well, actually, I rather wanted to go to bed.
I'm afraid there's really nothing for you to steal here.
Oh, I don't know.
There are a couple of pictures and the silver's not bad.
Kitten!
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.
Stay where you are.
And don't make a run for it.
My dear girl, I've been on the run for week s.
I'm exhausted.
You don't look like a burglar.
Perhaps it's the suntan.
Where did you pick it up?
California.
You're an international operator.
Hello?
- Police?
Hello, hello?
California?
What is this?
Who's speaking?
I'm most terribly sorry, it's a false alarm.
I thought I had a burglar.
You're Dr. Cardew.
And I'm in... your bed.
I assure you, I can't think of a nicer place for you.
Oh.
Well, we weren't expecting you, you see.
I'm Nicola Barrington.
And I help Richard.
Lucky Richard.
Oh, no.
No, I...
I mean that...
What's the matter?
Well, you are an old sly boots, aren't you?
It's all right, Kitten.
He...
He's Dr. Cardew.
Good morning, and whom do you help?
Dr. Burke?
No, he's gone.
Not Wildewinde, unless times have changed?
Wildewinde's gone, too.
Took off on his broomstick at last, did he?
What a relief.
It's all right.
His temperature's down and he's sleeping.
Oh, thank God!
Good morning, Richard.
Oh, Clive, you're back.
Oh, this is my fiancée.
Thank goodness!
It was wearing me out!
I want to hire a wedding outfit.
Yes, sir.
Will you take the cubicle at the end, sir, and I'll send an assistant?
- Thank you.
- Mr. Fordyce?
The trousers are a little tight, my lord.
And what medals shall we put on, General?
The lot?
I'm afraid that is all the crowns we have, Your Highness.
TONY:
Not bad.
Haven't you got something a bit gayer?
That's the correct one for a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, sir.
- Richard!
- Tony.
Well, congratulations.
I didn't know they'd made you a fellow.
Oh, it's...
What about one of those gold tassel jobs with whatnots and things?
Yes, sir, but that's worn only by the presidents.
Ah, well, let's have a gander at it.
Eh, what?
They haven't made me a fellow, actually.
But I've been asked to conversazione by an American professor.
A lovely thing she is, too.
Stack s of money and impressionable with it.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
That should do the trick, all right.
- Room to hide a bottle under it, too.
- Should fool anyone.
Yeah.
Do you think so?
What are you doing here, anyway?
- Hiring a wedding outfit.
- Oh?
Who's getting married?
I am.
To your successor.
What?
You mustn't do a thing like that.
A woman doctor?
I can just see her now.
Steel-rimmed glasses and buck teeth.
- Oh, Tony.
- I know, and think!
You'd better come to Hampton Cross and meet her.
She'll be there this weekend.
I think I better had.
You need life-saving!
And you need a morning suit.
You're going to be best man.
I say, excuse me...
Well, think it over.
This practice could do with a woman doctor.
You could hold the Field Marshal's hand for a change.
Do you think married doctors working together would do?
- Well, why ever not?
- I was only wondering.
There's an answer to your advert.
The one to take the place of me.
I've put her in the surgery.
Do the exploratory, will you, Richard?
I'm not decent.
Yes, all right.
So sorry...
- Good Lord!
Sally.
- Richard!
But you're not after this job?
- Yes.
- Why?
Well, I live quite near here.
Jobs are difficult to get for an unfrocked nurse.
- W-What about that pilot?
- What pilot?
Well, Hinxman said that you'd gone off with a pilot... or a BBC chap.
Nothing so exciting.
I was sacked.
Matron said I was too friendly with the patients.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my fault, I'm afraid.
Well, I asked for it, I suppose.
I don't really know very much about Richard.
About his past, anyway.
Well, I wouldn't say he was an actual Jack the Ripper, would you?
No, but it would be nice to know if there are any skeletons about.
Sally, do you think you could develop amnesia about that little affair?
Don't worry, it's a job I want now.
Well, then, you can have it.
How marvelous!
But shouldn't you ask your partner first?
Well, he's... he's not here at the moment.
You call by on Monday and I'll fix it all up.
Oh, thank you, Richard.
You are a dear.
The investigation's taking rather a long time, isn't it?
We must have the right girl.
- Well?
- Oh, I think she'll do.
- She's coming on Monday.
- What's her name?
Florence Nightingale.
Oh, really, Ri...
She's just a girl.
Won't need to supply her with a lamp.
We don't need a lamp to see the lipstick on your cheek.
Oh.
Well... she was very grateful for what I'd done.
What exactly had you done?
- Oh, Nicky...
- Well?
Hello, sir.
I just bumped into Florence Nightingale.
What's she doing here?
You're not engaged to her again, Richard?
No, this is my fiancée.
Tony Burke.
Is it, indeed?
Well, well, well.
What a pleasant surprise.
May I kiss the bride?
- The best man's prerogative.
- Certainly not.
Of course you may.
Oh, I must congratulate you, Richard.
Your taste has improved immeasurably since the old days.
When I think of the bits you used to take around when we were at St. Swithin's.
I mean...
Tell us about the bits, Dr. Burke.
Tony, please.
I want you to always think of me as an old, old friend of the family.
- Shall we dance?
- Thank you.
You're not at the Palais now, remember?
- Phone call for you, Dr. Hare.
- Hm?
- Phone call, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Nicky.
Nicky!
Oh, Richard's one of the best.
A bit simple sometimes, perhaps.
A little bit flighty.
Tell me about Sally Nightingale.
Oh, yes... pretty girl.
There was nothing in that, really.
I don't want to talk about other girls when I'm dancing with the prettiest one in the business.
Look, I've got to go to a call.
Cardew's out already.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, I'll take you home first.
Home?
Nonsense!
We're just getting into the beat, aren't we, Nicky?
Yes, I'd like to stay.
Well, I'll be back as soon as I can.
Well, take your time.
Don't you worry about us.
Nicky?
Nicky?
Where's Tony?
- Gone back to London.
- Oh, did he offer you a lift?
Yes, he did, as a matter of fact.
What are you doing, acting like that in the club?
You're meant to be my fiancée.
You'd better decide whether your fiancée is me or the lady with the lamp and a lot of lipstick.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Sally and I were all over ages ago.
Is that why you welcome her into the family circle now?
Look, I tell you, she means nothing to me!
- Keep your voice down, you'll wake up Clive!
- Oh, s...
Where are you going?
You're staying here tonight.
I'm not.
Why didn't you accept Clive's offer to stay?
Don't you like him?
Yes, I like him very much.
I just don't want to be the first on your matrimonial round.
- Nicky, I'm not like that.
- It's no use.
Doctors shouldn't marry doctors.
They shouldn't marry at all!
You mean you're chucking me over after all this?
Yes, I am.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Richard.
Oh, it's a great pity.
I was looking forward to having our Dr. Barrington on the string.
I'm afraid all that's gone into the disposal bin.
The Field Marshal quite perked up when I told him about her.
Oh, well, he'll just have to concentrate on his memoirs now.
- You still love her, don't you?
- Yes.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
I did warn you.
I know.
Well, I'll get over it.
If only one could inoculate against it.
The boffin who isolates that virus will deserve the Nobel Prize and a bust in every registry office from here to Lapland.
Dr. Cardew.
Oh, hello, my dear.
Good gracious.
Well, we'll have to cope with that.
Yes, this morning.
All right.
I think you'd better answer that distress signal.
It'll be a counterirritant.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, sir.
- What the blazes do you want?
- Oh, Lady Spratt sent for me, sir.
I didn't.
So get out of here, you miserable leech.
Nonsense, Lancelot.
I sent for the doctor because you're not well.
I'm perfectly well.
I just happen to choose to spend the morning in bed.
Well, I'm tired of your having stomach aches and blaming the food,
When you know perfectly well Mabel is the best cook we've ever had.
Stomach ache, sir?
Just because my guts gripe from time to time, this damn woman thinks I'm at death's door.
Stop bawling, Lancelot, and let Dr. Hare examine you.
I refuse.
Lancelot... at the moment, all your Napoleon brandy is standing on the corner of the kitchen sink.
If you refuse, I'll ring the bell and ask Perkins...
But this is blackmail!
Something like it.
I quite agree.
Very well.
See your hands are warm.
Go on, man!
You've seen a belly before, haven't you?
Yes, sir, but... there are certain exceptional circumstances.
- It's the sort of moment of truth.
- What?
!
Nothing.
I... really wanted to ask you some questions first.
Later!
I'm getting chilly.
Very well, sir.
If you're going to examine me, examine me.
Don't tickle me.
I'm not a chit of a nurse.
There are certain differences, sir.
Does that hurt?
Of course it hurts, you nincompoop!
Why do you think I sent for you?
Well, sir, in my opinion, you have acute appendicitis.
I've been telling him that for months.
She's been telling me.
Do you hear that, Hare?
Telling me.
- I think it should come out as soon as possible.
- Rubbish.
Now, Lancelot, either your appendix goes or I do.
There isn't room for it and me in this house.
Never tangle with women, Hare.
Very well.
But I won't go into any nursing home.
I'll come into your local slaughterhouse
- so I can keep an eye on things.
- Shall I get Richardson from St. Swithin's?
Richardson?
He's nothing but a painless killer!
- Well, then, Braithwaite?
- Braithwaite?
!
He loathes my guts and he'd jump at the chance to remove them, even if it meant a murder rap.
You'd better do it yourself.
Me?
!
I've taught you all you know and I'd just as soon trust you as anybody else.
- Yes, I know, sir, but...
- Damn it, Man!
You're being offered the chance to slice up one of the best-known breadbaskets in Britain.
If you don't slaughter me, you're made for life!
But you can't do this to old Richard.
He's a bit of a clot in some ways, I know, but... he's my oldest friend.
You must marry him.
Besides...
I've bought the cigarette box.
I haven't actually, but I've seen it.
I thought you weren't so keen on marriage.
Not as a general rule, but... this is different.
I mean, you...
You do him good.
Excuse me.
Oh, good morning, Dr. Cardew.
Good morning.
I'm sorry to arrive like this, but I was in London and I thought I'd return this.
- I found it in my cupboard.
- Oh.
Well, go in and sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
- Hello, Tony.
- Oh, hello, sir.
How's old Richard?
Richard?
Well, I'm a bit worried about Richard.
He's not ill, is he?
I'm afraid we've got an appendix operation on our hands.
It should be all right, but Sir Lancelot isn't too happy about it.
Sir Lancelot?
Is he doing it?
He insists on being there.
But why?
An appendectomy isn't serious.
Well, there were certain...
complications in this case.
Is it a big op, then?
In a sense, yes.
- When?
- This afternoon.
I must go.
I've got to get back there.
Poor old Richard.
Oh, well... can you give me a lift?
Well, certainly, my dear.
Thank you.
I'd better get up there, too.
I might be able to help in some way.
Well, we can only hope that it all...
comes out all right.
If I have to wait much longer, you'll have to put the cause of death down as old age.
What's the hold-up?
Can't find a burial plot?
- No, sir, it's not that.
As a matter of fact, it's...
- Tell them to book a big plot, about 40 acres.
I sleep very restlessly.
We're waiting for the anesthetist.
Why don't you get another one?
They're two a penny.
I think you should have a little sedative, Sir Lancelot.
And I think you should both... get out of here!
I hope he comes soon.
You'd need a sledgehammer to knock the old boy out in this state.
What are you two nattering about over there?
I'd really just like to get to the hospital.
I don't need a drink.
- It's good for shock.
- I'm not suffering from shock.
I think you may be later.
He will come through it all right, won't he?
I'd say that all depends on his doctor.
You've got to get here, quick!
Well, can't you get a lift off someone?
- Hello, old boy.
- Well, there must be something you can do.
- Richard!
- Oh, never mind.
Forget it.
Tony, you did anesthetics at St. Swithin's, didn't you?
- Anesthetics?
Yes, why?
- Tell Sister I've got a substitute anesthetist.
Why are you walking about?
You ought to be being shaved and knocking back Omnopon.
You come with me.
In here.
Sorry.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Where have you been, girl?
- Sorry, sir.
Do you want a...
- No, I don't want a bottle.
Find Dr. Hare and tell him I'm off and taking my ruddy appendix with me.
It's all right, Sir Lancelot, we have an anesthetist.
And about time, too.
What's that?
Just a preliminary prick to make you drowsy.
Drowsy?
I've got to keep my eyes skinned till the last moment in this dump!
Take it away, woman!
Anything to oblige, old man.
You know, I was worried sick coming up here.
It'll be fun twiddling the old knobs again.
By the way, who's the patient?
- Lancelot Spratt.
- Oh, really...
Spratt?
!
Not on your life!
He'll go right up the wall!
No, you don't.
You mucked up my marriage for me.
You're not going to muck this up, too.
Yes, but he'll recognize me.
The patient's on his way up, Doctor.
Put your mask on and keep it on.
- Sir Lancelot, wait!
- Take this, my man.
Who sent this ruddy pram down to me?
You, Sister?
- Well, it is customary, Sir Lancelot.
- I know and £5 extra on the bill.
I know these trick s, and I'm quite capable of walking, thank you.
I must say, you're an unsanitary-looking lot.
It gives me blood poisoning just to look at you.
- Are those things sharp?
- Oh, yes, Sir Lancelot.
We had them all rubbed up on the doorstep.
And there's a hammer and chisel in the sterilizer
- in case it's needed.
- My stomach is no laughing matter, Doctor.
Yes, sir.
I think Lady Spratt would agree, sir.
Now, you nurses...
I don't want any swabs or odds and ends left floating around inside me.
One swab and you're for the Old Bailey!
So remember.
Well, Sir Lancelot, shall I start carving?
Otherwise the plates will get cold.
- Where's Dr. Hare?
- Dr. Hare?
He's in the theatre.
Already?
Never mind.
We'll wait.
Take your hands off me, woman.
You're supposed to be sterile.
Now, Hare... when I come round, if I ever do,
I don't want any nonsense about sips of glucose and smarmy talk.
There's a bottle of Heidsieck in my room and I expect it to still be there.
- That's very kind of you, sir.
- For me!
And don't forget it's my appendix.
I don't want to be handed my tonsils in a jar with the apologies of a matron.
When are we starting this mammoth production?
Where's the anesthetist?
I'm right here, Sir Lancelot.
Gassed any rabbits lately?
What's your name?
Erm...
MacGregor?
SPRATT Another ruddy Scotsman.
I don't need any examination.
My heart's as sound as a bell.
Good, good.
Just pump the stuff into me and keep on pumping until I'm sewn up.
- Aye.
- And if I start turning blue, you'll hear from me!
I ken what you mean, Sir Lancelot.
You can have the utmost confidence in me.
Get on, man.
You're not drilling for uranium.
Och.
Prick me, don't skewer me!
I'm not a shish kebab!
Terribly sorry.
I know you!
I kicked you out of the theatre at St. Swithin's.
What the devil's going on here?
If you think I'll let myself be messed about by some oaf who doesn't know the difference between sewer gas and nitrous oxide, you're jolly well mis...
Scalpel.
- All over, Sister?
- Yes, Dr. Cardew.
How is Dr. Hare?
As well as can be expected under the circumstances.
I'm going in.
Richard!
- Darling?
Nicky!
Where's that funny champagne?
Are you nearly through?
I'll be with you soon.
Good evening, Mr. Starck.
Good evening, sir.
It continues to be warm.
Yes, it's so hot, and we've been making preserves all day long.
Is that so - is it a good fruit year?
Fairly good...we had a cold spring but the summer's been intolerably hot...
We city folk have been made to feel it.
I came from the country yesterday... when the evenings get dark, you long to get inside.
Neither I nor my wife have been outside the city limits.
The business is at a standstill, but you must stay at your post.
... get ready for winter.
First there's the strawberries, and then the cherries, the raspberries and the gooseberries, the melons and the whole autumn harvest.
Tell me something, Mr. Starck, are they going to sell this house?
No, not that I've heard!
Are there many people living here?
I think there are ten families counting those that live on the court side... but none of them know each other... there's very little gossip in this house it seems rather as if they want to hide themselves.
And it's called the silent house!
Yes, they don't do much talking here.
But many a drama has been played out here.
Tell me, Mr. Starck, who lives here, one flight up, over my brother?
Up there where the red curtains are shining... that's where the tenant died last summer when it stood empty for a month... and about a week ago a couple moved in... but I haven't seen them...
I don't think they go out even.
What makes you ask, consul?
Oh
- I don't know!
...
The four red curtains look as if bloody dramas were rehearsed behind them... so I imagine!
There's a phœnix-palm there like an iron whip throwing its shadow on the shade.
If you could only see some human figures.
I've seen plenty of them, but only late at night!
Were they women - or men?
There were both kinds.
But now I must go down to my pots.
I'll be ready soon...
Louise is sewing a button on my glove.
Do you intend to go down town then?
We might walk down a bit.
Whom were you talking with?
It was only the confectioner.
Oh, yes, he's a pleasant man... my only companion here all summer, for that matter.
Thanks, my child...you can leave the windows open...no mozzies.
I'm coming now.
- Good evening Louise.
- Good evening, Consul.
Have you really sat here at home every evening, never been out?
These light summer evenings make me nervous...
It's beautiful in the country, of course, ...but in the city it has the effect of being unnatural, almost terrible.
When they light the first street lamp I feel tranquil once more and able to go for my evening walk
Then I get tired, and sleep better.
But tell me, why do you stay here in the city when you could be in the country?
I don't know!
I've become fixed.
I'm bound to these rooms by memories.
I feel peace and protection only in there.
In there!
It's interesting to see your home from outside
I fancy I see someone else wandering about in there
Think of it
- I've wandered in there for ten years.
Is it ten years now?
Yes, time flies, when it's really past, but while it's passing it seems long.
The house was new at that time...
and I saw them lay the parquet floor in the drawing-room...
saw them paint the panels and doors and she chose the wall-papers that are still on.
Yes, that's the way it is!
The confectioner and I are the oldest tenants in the house and he too has had his vicissitudes.
He's the sort of human being who never has any luck.
Always in some tangle.
It's as if I lived his life and carried his burden with mine.
Does he drink then?
No!
Nor is he ever negligent, but he has no drive.
Yes, he and I know the chronicles of the house.
They've driven in here with wedding chariots... and out with hearses.
and that letter-box on the corner has received the secrets.
Didn't you have a death here around midsummer?
Yes, we had a typhoid case, it was a bank clerk.
And then the rooms were empty for a month.
The coffin came out first, then the widow... and the children and the furniture last.
Was that one flight up?
Yes, up there, where there's a light... the new tenants, whom I don't know yet.
Haven't you even seen them?
I never ask about the tenants
Whatever offers itself voluntarily I accept... without hassle and without involvement.
for I'm careful about the peace of old age.
Yes, old age!
I think it's beautiful to be old... for then you haven't very much of the record left to make.
I'm balancing my book with life and fellow beings and have already begun to pack for the journey.
Solitude is not what it might be, but when no one has any claim on you, then freedom is won.
The freedom to come and go, to think and act to eat and sleep according to your choice.
They're stirring up there!
Yes, it's so mysterious, but it's worse at night.
Sometimes they have music, but very bad.
Sometimes I imagine that they play cards and later, after midnight, cabs come.
I never complain about the tenants for then they revenge themselves.
It's best not to know anything!
What a tremendous post that fellow had!
It seemed to be a lot of circulars!
But who was he?
Musician?
It couldn't be anyone but the new tenant one flight up.
Musician, manager, a bit operatic, bordering on vaudeville, gambler...
Adonis, a little of each
With that white skin he ought to have black hair but it was brown...
it was dyed or else a wig
A smoking jacket at home suggests lack of wardrobe and the movements of his hands as he dropped the letters suggested shuffling, cut and deal.
Always waltzes, perhaps they have a dancing school.
but almost always it's the same waltz...
what's it called?
Upon my word, if it isn't... "La Pluie d'Or"...
I know that by heart.
Yes, that one and "Alcazar".
Are you still satisfied with Louise?
Very much so.
Isn't she going to marry?
Not to my knowledge.
No sweetheart around?
Why do you ask that?
I?
NO thanks!
I was too old the last time I married, considering we had a child immediately...
But I am now, and I wish to grow older in peace...
Do you think I'd want a mistress in my house to make away with my life, my honour, and my goods?
Your life and goods remained to you.
Was there any doubt about the honour?
Don't you know that there was?
What are you trying to say?
She murdered your honour when she left.
So I've gone about murdered and didn't know it?
You didn't know?
NO, but now you'll know the real circumstances...
When, at the age of fifty, I married a comparatively young girl... whose affection I had won, and who gladly gave me her hand
I promised her that when my age became heavy for her youth
I should go my way, restoring her freedom.
When in good time the child came and neither cared for anything more of that sort and after our daughter began to grow away from me, and I felt I was unnecessary, I left, that is to say...
I took a boat, as we were staying on an island at the time...
I'd kept my promise, and saved my honour... hadn't I?
Yes, but she considered her honour attacked, because she wanted to be the one to leave, and that's why she murdered you, with silent accusations, that you never knew about.
Did she accuse herself?
No, she had no reason to do so.
Then there's no danger.
Do you know anything about hers or the child's fate?
I don't want to know anything!
After I'd gone through all the agonies of the loss,
I considered the matter ended, and as only the beautiful memories remained in our apartment, I remained.
Think, that I got out of all that with my life!
And now it's all over!
Shall we take a turn on the Avenue?
Let's do so, and we'll see them lighting the first street lamp.
Louise...
Be so good as to give me my stick!
The light summer stick, just to hold in my hand.
Moonlight to-night!
The August moon?
I believe it's really a full moon.
Here, sir!
We'll be gone for a while, can't say how long.
Good evening, Miss...
It's rather warm...
Have your gentlemen gone?
Yes, they've gone down the Avenue
The first evening that the master has been out this summer.
We old ones love dusk.
It hides so many faults in ourselves and in others too.
Do you know, Miss, that my old woman is going blind, but she doesn't want an operation!
There's nothing worth looking at she says... and sometimes she wishes she were deaf too.
I sometimes feel that way.
You lead a quiet and beautiful life in there in prosperity and without worry.
I never hear a loud voice nor the slamming of a door... perhaps a little too quiet for a young lady like you?
Not at all.
You never have callers either?
No, only the consul comes...
and I've never seen such brotherly love.
Where are you going, my girl?
I'm just going for a little walk!
That's alright, but come back soon.
Do you think your master still mourns his loved ones?
He doesn't mourn, nor does he miss them, as he doesn't long for their return but he lives with them in memories... just the beautiful ones.
But the daughter's fate must worry him sometimes...
Yes, he must fear the mother's marrying again... raising the question of who the step-father would be.
I've been told that the wife refused all support at first but after five years had passed she sent a lawyer with a long bill amounting to thousands.
I don't know about that.
I believe she's more beautiful in his memory than...
Excuse me...
does Mr. Fischer live here?
Mr. Fischer?
Not that I know of.
Perhaps it's Fischer who lives one flight up.
Ring one flight up around the corner.
One flight up.
Thanks.
Now it'll be a sleepless night again... when they carry up bottles.
What sort of people are they?
Why are they never seen?
They must go out the back way...
I've never seen them.
But I hear them!
Me too.
Corks popping, doors slamming and other sorts of banging perhaps.
That was lightning!
One, two, three...
They're just heat flashes...
There's no thunder.
Starck dear, come down and help me melt the sugar.
I'm coming, old girl.
See...we're making jam
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Hasn't my brother returned?
No, sir.
He went in to telephone so I came ahead.
Well, he'll be here soon of course.
What's this?
What does it say?
"Boston Club after midnight - at Fischers"
Who's Fischers, do you know, Louise?
A man was just here with wine... looking for someone called Fischer one flight up.
One flight up, Fischers!
Red curtains lit up like a cigar sign at night...
I believe you've had bad company come into the house.
What's a Boston Club?
It might be something quite innocent
But in this case I'm not so sure.
But how did the post card...?
It was he who dropped it a while ago putting them in the box.
Fischer?
I've heard that name before in connection with something I've forgotten.
What in heaven's name are they doing up there?
Killing each other?
There's another scream...
in the stairway.
Is it really you, my one-time sister-in-law?
How did you get here in this house, and why begrudge my brother his peace?
I believed he'd moved... it's not my fault.
Don't be afraid of me, you mustn't be afraid of me, Gerda
Can I help you?
What's going on up there?
He struck me!
Is your little girl with you?
Yes.
She has a step-father then?
Yes!
Put up your hair and calm yourself, and I'll try to straighten this out... but spare my brother.
He hates me, of course.
No, he doesn't hate you.
Where's he now?
Out walking on the avenue, he'll soon be here with his paper.
But you must go back up to your...
I can't go back.
I can't go back to that man.
Who and what is he?
He's been...a singer.
"Has been", and is now...?
A swindler!
Yes.
Keeps gambling rooms.
Yes.
And the child?
...a decoy!
Don't say that!
You're too harsh!
Yes, we must handle unclean things delicately...so delicately!
But a righteous matter can be dirtied.
Why did you defile his honour and why did you deceive me into being your accomplice?
He deserted me...
and that was an insult.
Not for you!
Your youth saved you from humiliation.
He should've allowed ME to leave HIM.
Why did you want him to have the dishonour?
Why would it have to be me?
I can't follow your thoughts, which only turn on hate...
But if we let the matter of restoring his honour go and think about saving his child.
What shall we do then?
She is my child.
The law gave her to me, and my husband is her father.
Quiet...he's coming.
Yes...it's him!
Come here and see your home!
How he has kept everything just as you arranged it.
Don't be afraid...
he can't see us here in the dark
The light blinds him you see.
Just think how he's lied to me.
In what respect?
He hasn't aged any!
He just grew tired of me.
See the collar he wears and the very latest scarf!
I'm sure he has a sweetheart!
Her portrait's on the mantel...
between the candelabras.
That's me...and the child!
Does he still love me?
The memory of you.
How strange!
He's looking at us.
Stand still!
He's looking right in my eyes.
Stand still!
He can't see you!
He looks like a dead man.
Wasn't he murdered?
Don't say that!
Karl Fredrik!
Are you alone?
I thought...
Are you really alone?
As you can see!
It's so close, and the flowers give me headache.
Now I'll just finish my paper.
Now, about you...
do you want me to go up with you?
Perhaps.
But there'll be a lot of trouble.
But the child must be saved...
And I am a lawyer.
Very well, for the child's sake.
Follow me.
Karl Fredrik!
...
Come and play chess!
Where did my brother go?
He was outside just now.
He can't be far away.
What a dreadful racket they're making up there.
It's as if they were tramping on my head.
Now they are pulling out bureau drawers as if they intended to move, run away perhaps.
If you could only play chess Louise!
I can...a little...
Well...if you only know how to move the pieces...it's something.
Sit down, my child!
They are making such a clatter up there the chandelier shakes, and below the confectioner is stoking his fire.
I think I'll move out soon.
I've thought for a long time you ought to move, sir, anyway.
"Anyway?"
It isn't good to sit too long among old memories.
Why not?
When it's all over, all memories are beautiful.
But you might live twenty years yet, sir... and that'll be too long to live in memories that fade nevertheless and some day perhaps may change colour.
How wise you are, little child!
Begin now...
Move a pawn.
But not the queen's... then you'll weaken yourself in two moves.
Then I'll begin with the knight
Just as dangerous, my dear.
But I think I'll begin with the knight anyway
Good!
Then I'll move my jumping-pawn.
It's Mr. Starck with the biscuits.
He walks as quietly as a little mouse.
It seems like only yesterday Starck was first up here.
Well, it's ten years ago.
When you came with the wedding cake.
Does it look the same?
Just the same...
the palms have grown of course.
Otherwise quite the same.
And will be so until you come with the funeral cake.
After a certain age nothing changes... everything comes to a standstill but life slides along like a sled down a slope.
Yes, that's the way it is!
And in that way it's quiet.
No love, no friends... just a bit of company in the solitude.
and then human beings become just people... without the proprietary rights to your feelings and sympathies.
And then you loosen like an old tooth without pain and without being missed.
There's Louise, for example... a young and beautiful girl through whose presence I experience satisfaction like that of a work of art you don't expect to own.
Nothing disturbs our relationship!
My brother and I associate with each other like two elderly gentlemen who never become too familiar or force each other's confidences.
Through keeping a neutrality with people you get a certain distance and at a distance we always make a better impression!
In a word, I'm satisfied with old age and its peace and quiet.
Louise!
The washing has just come back and I must check it.
Well, Mr. Starck, won't you sit down and talk or perhaps you can play chess?
I can't stay away from my pots, and at eleven I must fire the bake-oven.
Thanks, however, for your hospitality.
If you should see my brother, ask him to come in and keep me company.
I'll be sure to do that.
The peace and quiet of old age!
Can't you postpone whatever you're doing about the washing?
That's impossible... the washwoman's in a hurry and her husband and children are waiting for her.
Is that you, Karl Fredrik?
No, it's the postman.
Excuse my coming in but the doors are open.
Is there a letter for me?
Only a post-card.
Mr. Fischer again...
Boston Club.
That's him up above!
With the white hands and the smoking jacket!
And to me!
It's scandalous !
I have to move!
Is that you, Karl Fredrik?
It's the ice-man!
It's fine to get ice in this heat!
But be careful of the bottles in the ice-box.
And put the piece on edge, so I can hear the water drops fall as it melts.
It's my water clock, that measures out the time.
the long time.
Look here, where do you get that ice?
Has he gone?
They all go home... to be able to hear their own voices and have company.
Is that you, Karl Fredrik?
Who's playing?
My impromptu!
Is it you, Karl Fredrik?
It's me.
Where have you been so long?
I had a bit of business to straighten out.
Have you been alone?
Yes!
Come and play chess with me now.
I'd rather talk!
And you too may need to hear your voice.
Quite true, but it's so easy for us to get into the past.
Then we forget the present.
The present doesn't exist... what is now passing is empty nothingness.
The future or the past...
The future preferably, for hope exists there.
Hope, for what?
A change!
Good !
You mean to say that you have had enough of the peace of old age?
Perhaps!
Quite so!
And if you were able to choose between solitude and the past...
No ghosts however!
What about your memories then?
They don't disturb... they are my poems about certain realities.
but if the dead should appear again, that would be ghosts.
However - in your memory which of the two gives the most beautiful mirage... the woman or the child?
Both!
I cannot separate them... and that's why I never sought to keep the child.
But was that right?
Didn't you think of the possibility of a step-father?
I didn't think so far ahead then, but since...
I have...reflected...
about...that...matter.
A step-father, who misused...
perhaps degraded your child!
Hush!
What did you hear?
I thought I heard " the little feet,"
the little tripping feet in the hall when she came to find me.
It was the child that was the best.
To see this dauntless little being who feared nothing... who divined nothing of life's treachery... who had no secrets at all.
I remember her first realization of human evil.
She noticed a beautiful child in the park... and she ran with open arms to kiss the stranger.
The beautiful child returned the friendliness by biting her cheek and sticking out her tongue.
You should have seen my little Anne-Charlotte then.
She stood petrified...
not by the pain... but with terror to see this abyss, which is called the human heart, open itself.
But why are we here talking about this?
Is it on account of the heat or the thunder, or what?
Loneliness brings heavy thoughts and you ought to have company.
This summer in the city seems to have broken you down.
It's only these last few weeks...
The illness...and the corpse they had up there affected me...as if it were me going through it all.
The confectioner's troubles have also become mine.
So much so that I worry about his business, his wife's eye trouble...
his future.
And lately...
I dream every night about my little Anne-Charlotte.
I see her in dangers...
strange, unthinkable, nameless.
And before I sleep, when the ear is most sensitive,
I hear her little feet, and sometimes I hear her voice.
Where is she then?
Yes, where !
Suppose you should meet her in the street?
I imagine I'd lose my reason or fall to the ground.
Five years at that age make you unrecognizable!
Imagine not recognizing your own child!
No, I wouldn't survive it!
No, I'd rather keep my little four-year-old on the home altar.
I don't want any other.
Is that you, Louise, arranging things in the linen-closet?
It smells so clean, and it reminds me of
- Yes... the mother of the house at the linen-closet the good fairy, who takes care of things
the housekeeper with the flat-iron who smooths the rough places and takes out the wrinkles.
Yes, the wrinkles.
Now I think...
I'll...go...in and write a letter.
If you care to stay I'll be right back.
Are you...
Oh God!
That sound that I've carried in my ears for ten years!
That clock, that never kept time but tolled the hours, nights and days for five long years.
My piano... my palms... the dining-table!
He's kept it all in memory...
clean as a new pin!
My sideboard !
With the knight and Eve...
Eve with the basket of apples.
In the right drawer, way back, was a thermometer.
Yes, there it is!
What's that signify?
Oh, it became a symbol in the end...
Of inconstancy.
When set up our house, the thermometer was missed.
It should have been put outside the window.
I promised to put it out...
and forgot.
He promised to do it...
and forgot.
Then we nagged each other, and finally, to get away from it
I hid it in this drawer.
I began to hate it and him as well.
Do you know what it signified?
Well, no one believed in the permanency of our relationship when we threw off our masks so soon and showed our antipathies.
In the first days we lived as if we were on springs... ready to jump at any time.
Like the thermometer...
and here it is still!
Up and down, always changing, like the weather.
My chess-board!
He bought that to pass away the long days of waiting before the little one came!
Who does he play with now?
With me.
Where is he?
He's in his room writing a letter!
Where?
There!
And here he's been...
for five long years?
Ten years...
five years alone!
But he loves solitude, doesn't he?
I believe he's had enough of it.
Will he show me the door?
Try!
You risk nothing...
he's always courteous.
I haven't done anything to that deserter!
You'll risk his asking about the child.
But it's he who must help me find the child.
First to get out of this disagreeable neighbourhood
Then to get me to run after him.
He's taken the girl as hostage... to be raised in the ballet... that she has shows a natural ability for.
The ballet!
The father mustn't know that... as he hates the stage!
The stage!
I've been on it, too!
You?
!
Yes...as accompanist.
Poor Gerda.
Why so?
I loved the life... and when I was imprisoned here it wasn't the jailer's fault but the prison's...
that I didn't thrive.
But now you've had enough of it?
Now I love quiet and solitude... my child above everything.
Hush, he's coming!
Now I'll leave you!
Don't think of what you should say... it will come of itself... like the next move in a chess game.
I fear his first glances most, for in them I'll read whether I've changed for the better or worse whether I've become old and ugly.
If he finds you aged, he'll dare approach you.
If he finds you just as young, he'll lose hope and he's more humble than you think.
He went out to the letter-box.
I can never go through with this!
How shall I be able to ask him about getting this divorce?
I'm going!
It's too brazen!
Stay!
You know his kindness is unlimited.
He'll help you, for the child's sake.
No, no!
He's the only one who can help.
All through?
Set up the board again Louise...
and we'll start over.
Hello!
- Good evening, is it you, mother...
Yes, thanks
Louise is already sitting at the chess-board but is a bit tired from things she's had to do.
Yes, it's all done now, everything's finished.
Just little things.
If it's warm?
The thunder storm passed over our heads, right over us, but it didn't strike!
A false alarm!
What did you say?
Fischers!
Yes, but I think they're about to move!
Yes, it goes at....6.15.
The outer route through the islands... and arrives at...
let me see...8.25!
Did you have a nice time?
Yes, he's too ridiculous when he gets started.
What did Maria say about it?
How has it been this summer?
Louise and I have kept each other company.
She's so nice and sweet-tempered.
No thanks...not that!
My eyes?
Yes, I'm getting near-sighted... but I say like the confectioner's old wife:
there's nothing to look at!
Wish I were a little deaf too!
Deaf and blind!
The neighbours up above make a horrible lot of noise at night.
It's some kind of gambling club.
There...now they're on the line to listen !
Think of it, breaking into our conversation by listening.
To-morrow then, at 6.15.
Thanks so much, mother.
Same to you!
I'll be sure to.
Good-by, mother!
Was it you?
Wasn't it Louise, just now?
Forgive me, I was passing through, walked by... and I felt a longing to see my old home again.
The windows were open.
Do you find it the same?
It's the same, but something else...
There's something else.
Are you satisfied...
with your life?
Oh...yes!
...
It's as I wanted it.
And the child?
Oh...she grows and thrives.
She's fine.
Then I shan't ask any more.
Do you wish anything of me?
Can I be of service to you in any way?
I thank you, but...
I need nothing, after seeing that things are well with you too!
Would you like to see Anne-Charlotte?
I don't think so.
Now when I hear that all is well with her.
No...it's so hard to begin again.
It's like revision lessons, that you really know... although the teacher doesn't think so.
I'm so far away from all that...
I was away in wholly other places.
and I can't connect with the past...
It's hard for me to be discourteous but I can't ask you to sit down.
You are another man's wife.
And you aren't the same woman I parted from.
Am I so...changed?
Like a stranger!
Voice, look, manner.
Have I aged?
I don't know!
I find you so strange I can barely use "thou" .
I guess it'd be the same with my daughter.
Don't talk like that!
...
I'd rather see you angry.
Why should I be angry?
All the wicked things I've done to you.
Have you?
...
I don't feel you have.
Didn't you read the complaint?
Not at all...
I left that to my lawyer.
And the decision?
I haven't read that either.
As I didn't intend to marry again, I wasn't interested in such papers.
What did the papers say?
That I was too old?
That was only the truth, so that need not embarrass you.
I wrote precisely the same thing in my answer and requested that the judge give you your freedom.
Did you write that for YOU!
For me?
Yes !
..
I couldn't say I was too old when we were married for then the child's arrival might have been misinterpreted.
And it was OUR child, wasn't it?
You know that!
...
But...
Do you mean I should be ashamed of my age?
Yes, if I took to dancing the Boston and playing cards all night,
I'd soon be in a wheelchair or on an operating table.
That'd be shameful.
You don't look like that.
Did you think the separation would be the death of me?
There are those who believe that you murdered me.
Do I look as if I were murdered?
You needn't let your conscience torture you on my account.
Why did you marry me?
You know well enough why a man marries... and that I didn't have to beg for your love, you know too.
And you must remember how we smiled together at all the wise counsellors who warned you.
But why you ever tempted me I could never understand for after the wedding ceremony you didn't see me... but behaved as if you were at someone else's wedding.
I thought that you must have made a wager to murder me.
All of my business subordinates hated me for being their chief.
But they soon became your friends.
As soon as I acquired an enemy, he became your friend!
you should not hate your enemies, true... but you should not love MY enemies!
However, when I realized how things were,
I began to pack up, but first I wanted a living witness to your having spread a falsehood
and that's why I waited until the baby arrived.
To think that you could be so deceitful.
I became secretive but I never lied.
You gradually transformed my friends into detectives and you seduced my own brother to faithlessness toward me.
But, worst of all you awakened doubt about your child's legitimacy... with your thoughtless chatter.
I've taken that back!
An escaped word can't be caught on the wing again.
And worst is, the false report has reached the child who sees her mother as just a...
Oh, no!
Yes, that's the way it is!
You built a high tower on the foundation of a lie.
and now the tower is crashing down on you.
It isn't true!
The truth is...
I just met Anne-Charlotte.
You met...?
We met on the stairs, and she called me "uncle"...
Do you know what an "uncle" is?
He's an old friend of the family and the mother.
And I know I pass for "uncle" at her school too.
This is horrible ...for the child!
Did you meet?
Yes!
But I wasn't obliged to tell anyone.
Haven't I the right to keep silent?
For that matter, the meeting was so distressing that I blotted it out of my mind, as if it had never existed.
What can I do to make reparation?
YOU!
...
YOU can't make reparation.
That's to say, reparation has already been made.
Can't I make amends...
Can't I ask you to forgive?
What do you mean?
To restore...make reparation.
Do you mean to re-unite...
begin again... make you mistress of the house?
I don't want you!
I don't have to listen to this!
Accept it!
That's a beautiful maid you've got.
Yes, she IS beautiful.
Where did you get her?
Is it a bill?
...twenty-five!
Just the right change !
Poor Gerda!
What do you mean?
That I should be jealous of your servant?
That's not what I meant!
Yes, and you meant you were too old for me, but not for her.
I understand the insult.
She is beautiful though, for a servant.
Poor Gerda!
Why do you say that?
Because I pity you.
Jealous of my servant...
that's reparation!
Me... jealous!
Mr. Fischer?
Wrong apartment.
Oh yes, that's me.
He's eloped?
Who has he eloped with?
The confectioner Starck's daughter!
Oh, good God!
How old was she?
Just eighteen!
Just a child.
I knew he'd run away... but with a woman!
Now you are happy?
No, I'm not at all happy.
Although it comforts me to see there's justice in the world.
Life runs fast, and now you're in the boat that I was in.
Her eighteen years against my twenty-nine...
I'm old...too old for him!
Everything's relative.
But now to another matter!
Where's your child?
My child!
I had forgotten.
My child!
Good Lord!
Help me!
He's taken my child away with him...
He loved Anne-Charlotte as his own daughter!
Come with me to the police...
come with me!
Me?
Now you ask too much!
Help me !
Karl Fredrik, fetch a cab...
Will you do it?
For Christ's sake...
aren't we human beings?
It's beginning to rain lend me an umbrella.
Eighteen years old...
only eighteen!
The peace of old age!
Louise!
Come and play chess with me!
Has the consul...?
He's gone out on an errand.
Is it still raining?
No, not now!
Then I'll go out and cool off a little.
Do you know the confectioner's daughter?
Yes...very slightly.
Was she beautiful?
Yes.
Did you know the people upstairs?
I've never seen them!
Tactful as ever!
I've learned to not see nor hear in this house.
I must admit that acquired deafness
Keep tea in readiness...
and I'll go out and cool off.
And one thing... you see what's going on here... but don't ask me anything.
No, sir...
I'm not inquisitive.
Thanks my child.
That was a good little shower we had.
Quite a blessing
Now we'll soon get some raspberries.
Then you must let me order a few litres.
We're tired of doing our own preserving...
It just stands and ferments and gets mouldy.
Yes, I know all about that...
You have to keep an eye on the jars
There are those who put in salicylic acid... but that's a new trick that I won't touch.
Salicylic...that's said to be antiseptic and that might be good.
Yes, but you can taste it...
so it's cheating.
Have you a telephone Mr. Starck?
No.
I don't have a telephone.
Why do you ask that?
Oh, I was just thinking... you needs a telephone sometimes... orders...
important communications.
That may be, but sometimes it's good to escape...
Quite so quite so!
Yes, my heart always thumps when it rings.
You never know what you'll hear.
And I want peace, peace, above all things
Me too!
It's time they lit the street lamp!
He's probably forgotten us, as it's lit down the avenue.
No!
...
Then he'll soon be here.
It'll be really fun to see our lamp being lit again.
Anything new?
Nothing new.
Was it my brother?
No, it was the lady.
What did she want?
To talk to you, sir!
But I don't want to!
Do I comfort my executioner?
I used to do that, but now I'm tired of it.
And the confectioner's Agnes do you think he knows anything yet?
It's hard to say... he never speaks of his sorrows... nor does anyone else...
in this silent house.
Should he be told?
No, for heaven's sake.
But it's probably not the first time she's given him worry.
He never talks about her.
It's horrible!
No...
leave it.
I don't want to know anything!
It's terrible...
Poor Gerda!
It would be better to know...
I can't make myself act.
I can defend myself... but strike back, no!
But if you avoid a danger, it'll force itself on you and if you don't resist, you're crushed.
But if you don't allow yourself to take part... you're unassailable.
Unassailable?
Everything takes care of itself, if you don't... muddle it by interference.
How can they expect me to guide them, where so many passions rage!
I can neither subdue their passions nor change their course.
But the child?
I've relinquished my rights and for that matter...
to be honest, I'm not eager... certainly not now...
since she came in and destroyed my memories.
She obliterated everything beautiful that I had hidden away... and there's nothing left.
Who's this coming?
Agnes...
Good evening my child.
Where have you been?
I've been out for a walk.
Mama has asked for you several times
Has she?
Well, I'm here now.
Be a good girl and go down and help her fire the little oven.
Is she angry with me?
She couldn't be angry with you.
Oh yes she can... but she never says anything.
Isn't that good, my child... to escape scolding!
Does he know, or doesn't he?
It's best he never knows!
But what has happened?
A rupture?
What did the lady say on the telephone?
She wanted to talk to you.
How did she sound?
Was she excited?
Yes.
It seems rather brazen to appeal to me in a situation of this kind.
But the child!
Imagine...
I met my daughter on the stairs...
When I asked her if she recognized me... she called me "uncle"... and then informed me that her daddy was upstairs.
But to be sure...
he's her step-father and he has all the rights!
They've set about eradicating me slandered me.
A cab's stopped at the corner.
I do pray they're not coming back imagine hearing my child singing her new father's praises,
Then to have the old story start again...
"Why did you marry me? "
" You know well enough but why did you want me?"
"You know well enough"
and so on...
until the end of time.
It's the consul coming.
How does he look?
He doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
Rehearsing what he's going to say...
Does he look satisfied?
More thoughtful than...
Oh, yes...
It was always like that
If he came anywhere near that woman he became unfaithful to me!
She could charm everyone...
but me.
To me she was coarse, simple, ugly, stupid... and to the others she was refined...elegant...
beautiful...intelligent.
All the hatred my independence aroused... gathered about her in endless sympathy!
...
For the one who treated me unjustly!
Through her they sought to influence and control me, wound me... and in the end, kill me.
I'll go and open the door for the consul.
This storm should soon be over!
People can't endure independence.
They want you to obey them.
All my business subordinates down to the watchman wanted me to obey them and as I didn't care to obey them, they called me a despot!
The result!
...
No details!
Can't we sit down...
I'm a bit tired.
Where is my child?
May I start at the beginning?
Begin!
I reached the station with Gerda.
I saw him and Agnes at the ticket window.
Agnes was there then?
Yes... and your child!
Gerda stayed outside and I approached them.
At that moment he gave Agnes the tickets but when she saw that the tickets were 3rd class she threw them in his face and rushed out for a cab.
I began to get an explanation from the gentleman when Gerda ran up and took the child... and disappeared into the crowd.
What did the gentleman say?
Well...you know how it is when you hear the other side...
I want to hear!
He was of course not as bad as we'd thought... he also has his good points!
Just so.
Might have known!
But you'll hardly expect me to sit here and listen to a eulogy of my enemy?
No, not a eulogy, but... mitigating circumstances.
Would you ever listen to me when I informed you of the true conditions?
Yes, you listened and answered in disapproving silence... as if I sat there telling lies.
You always stood up for the wrong side and you believed the lies because you were infatuated with Gerda.
But there was also another motive.
Say no more, dear brother...
You see things only from your point of view.
Do you want me to see my position from my enemy's point of view?
I can hardly lift my hand against myself, can I?
I'm not your enemy
Yes, when you're friendly with the one who's been unjust to me.
Where's my child?
I don't know.
How did it finish at the station?
The gentleman took a train south.
And the others?
Disappeared.
Then I may have them stuck in my craw again.
Did you notice whether the others went with him?
No, he went alone.
Then we're rid of him at least!
Number two!
The mother and child!
Do you think they'll come back?
She won't...
She'd have to make up to you in front of Louise.
I'd forgotten that!
She really honoured me by being jealous!
I believe there's justice in the world after all.
She found out Agnes was younger, as well.
Poor...
Gerda!
But in such a case as this you can't tell people that justice exists for it's not true they love justice!
And their dirt must be handled delicately.
And Nemesis...
that's only for others!
There it goes ringing again.
It sounds like a rattlesnake
Did the snake bite you?
The lady's going to her mother in Dalarna to settle down there with the child.
The mother and child in the country, and in a good home!
Now it's cleared up!
And the lady asked me to go up and put out the lights in the apartment.
Do it right away.
And draw the curtains.
I think that storm has passed over.
It really seems to have cleared then the moon will be out.
It was a glorious shower of rain!
Splendid!
Look, there's the lamp-lighter!
At last!
The first light...
Now it's autumn!
That's our time of year, chaps!
Twilight's beginning... but with it comes understanding... that lights the way like a dark lantern... and keeps you from going astray.
Louise!
Close the windows and pull down the shades.
Then the memories can go to sleep, in peace!
The...peace...of...old...age!
And this autumn I'll move from the Silent House.

Come in!
Come in!
Come in!
Come in!
How about it?
Well, come one, come all everyone and be terrorized by the Cave of Horror!
Come in, come in!
There's no waiting!
No waiting!
Well, come in men and test your own mettle!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Enter!
Enter if you dare!
Who's there?
It's me, Tsukamoto.
Hey!
Hey!
A murder!
A murder!
Hey!
Call the police!
- I assure you, all of the monsters are fake.
It's terrible!
- What are you talking about?
Kirioka...
Where is Kirioka?
He was here a moment ago.
What's the matter with him?
If you see him, tell him I need the stereophonic work today.
- Sure.
Kirioka told me to give you this.
- What is it?
Where is he now?
He went to an amusement park about a murder.
He just left.
Hey, wise guy!
He works in science, not the City Desk!
When will the police give a statement?
- You'll have to wait a little longer.
- Longer?
!
Anyway, can you get us a detective?
- We need to get an interview!
As far as I know, we had the police inspect the park a year ago and never had a problem.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
- We'll discuss that later.
- Yes.
- Hey, pops!
- Yes?
Is this the sort of thing you have in that cave?
- Of course not.
There's nothing dangerous at all in there.
Has anyone disappeared since the murder?
No, I'm sure that everyone's still here.
No one has left.
I suppose everyone here witnessed the murder.
Does anyone remember what he looked like?
We need your complete cooperation.
Well, um...
We couldn't recognize his face.
Is this better?
This is where the murder occurred.
All of you were standing here.
Are you saying you couldn't see this man?
Yes, but all we could see was his back.
- Yes, that's right.
Then where did he run off to?
That way.
Hey, they're coming out of the cave!
Hey, reporters!
Reporters!
Here!
Huh?
Is that you, Kirioka?
Oh, Yoshi!
You!
Are you saying this guy's a reporter?
- Yes, it's true.
What did he do?
I might have guessed he was a journalist.
Captain.
We found this on the victim's body.
Those are identification tags.
- As if a child couldn't figure that one out!
"Tsukamoto, meet me at the Cave of Horror in the amusement park if you wish to learn what happened fourteen years ago."
Onishi you don't think there's a possibility that Tsudo might have sent such a thing to us?
Nonsense.
- But Tsukamoto was murdered while wearing his tag!
I know it's him!
It's Lance Corporal Tsudo's work!
Takashi, don't forget that we saw Tsudo die.
After all this time, do you think a corpse will return to life?
But, we never managed to find his body or remains!
His remains simply decomposed.
But!
Listen...
I think I know who's behind this.
Who is it?
!
Taki...
Taki?
He's a contractor working for Kofu.
That's right.
- But why would he murder Tsukamoto unless he had a reason?
I don't think there's a reason for it!
I think he has one.
Taki must suspect that we found gold fourteen years ago.
He doesn't know we made our money through smuggling.
He thinks that we found the box
Professor it's not an ordinary wire, is it?
Kirioka I believe that this is a Klyotron.
A Klyotron?
To put it simply, it's a substance that can take the place of a transistor.
So, it's similar to a vacuum tube?
Yes.
It requires the use of a metal named Tantam.
Thin wires are wound around a small metal bar in this manner.
It has many possibilities.
It is much smaller in size than any other transistor currently available.
So it must be very practical, huh?
However, there is a drawback.
It needs to be kept at a low temperature consistently.
It must be at 4.2 degrees Celsius at all times, or it simply will not function at all.
Oh, it must be kept at four degrees?
Akiko, you have a customer.
Oh, really?
I think he works for a housing corporation.
- That's right.
Do you know him?
- I don't know him.
He bought some refrigeration units from us recently.
Really?
That must be why he seems so cold and clammy.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Um... have a seat.
Are you in the sales department?
Yes, my name is Akiko Chujo.
The truth is, I'm here about those refrigeration units.
You've delivered two of the four I ordered but I need the other two completed and shipped to me quickly.
Oh, them...
We just shipped those units out yesterday.
Then I must have just missed them.
I'm sorry we couldn't get them to you sooner.
- No, no...
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
By the way, were they delivered to the Kurasawa station?
Yes.
Oh, really?
Thank you for your help.
Tsukamoto was a bachelor, as far as I know.
He didn't mix much with the folk around here.
Oh?
Do you know where he worked?
- I know that he was a broker.
He always paid his bills on time, too.
He seemed like he was doing just fine.
Do you mind if I look around his apartment?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
It's room three on the second floor.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
No, it was my fault.
- How could you know where I was?
I'll get them.
Sorry.
What?
It's you?
!
You had me worried for a moment.
Kobayashi!
It's okay.
It's just a reporter.
What?
Is that you, Kirioka?
Kobayashi?
Fancy meeting you here.
Do you know him?
- He and I went to school together.
Hey, I never pegged you for a reporter.
That's a joke!
I started writing science articles as soon as I left college.
So, a science reporter is investigating a murder?
Well, what do you know about this murder case?
There had to be a reason why someone would want to see Tsukamoto dead.
It seems so...
Smuggling?
Narcotics?
We're not sure.
We kept our eyes on him, but he was murdered before we could discover anything.
Attention!
Loyal guests!
At ease!
Welcome to the Military-Land Cabaret!
Hey, aren't you thirsty?
I'm drinking.
- Your friend seems the quiet type.
He'd be a good soldier.
Did you go to college with him?
- Yes.
He was one of the best students there.
This is too strong.
What kind of drink is this?
- It's our 'Hand Grenade'.
It's not for me.
Can I have something lighter.
- Sure.
Two "Missiles", please!
- Oh yes, sir!
Roger!
I'm getting kind of hungry too.
Hey, how about some rations?
- Yes, sir!
I'll transport them right away!
Transport?
Hey, Kobayashi...
Talk to me.
What about?
What would bring you to this place?
I'm not blind, you know.
Take a guess.
The broker's murder?
Hmm... that's good.
We've been on to this place for a while.
It's owned by a smuggler named Takashi.
Our detective friend has come back again.
We should thank him for the business.
That other guy...
He doesn't look like a policeman.
- Right.
They must not have found anything in Tsukamoto's room.
He was a careful person...
Much too careful to leave anything suspicious in his room.
About the situation with Taki...
I think we should get rid of him right away.
In his current state, he may try to pull some kind of blackmail on us.
Master!
Master, there's a customer who wants to see you.
Who is it?
He said you would know him by this.
Shall I send him in?
Hello!
Taki, when did you get here?
Onishi, I want you to stop doing this to me.
Stop doing?
What are you talking about?
Don't play with me!
It's this!
You guys have been sending these ID tags to me!
Then you've been getting them too?
You mean you guys aren't behind it?
- It wasn't us.
Taki, you heard the news that Tsukamoto was murdered?
That ID tag...
Takashi and I got one too.
We actually thought...
maybe you had sent them to us.
- You must be joking!
But then, who could be responsible for sending them to us?
We don't know.
If it's not either of us...
No, could it be?
- Who is it?
!
- Taki, it's Lance Corporal Tsudo.
What?
Lance Corporal Tsudo?
!
Idiot!
Knock before you come in!
Yes, sir.
A man gave this to me and asked that I bring it to you.
Hey, I should head home.
So soon?
Who's waiting for you to come home?
It doesn't matter how long.
They know you're here.
I know, but it's still too early.
Stick around.
Hurry up.
Come closer...
Hey, guys, that's some attack!
I'd like to have her for an enemy!
Gentlemen, do you recognize the sound of this gun?
Surely you haven't forgotten the sound of my voice.
It's Tsudo!
I've waited for fourteen years.
There's no way I could forget you...
Lieutenant Onishi...
Intelligence Agent Takashi...
Taki, of the Construction Corp.
I am Tsudo.
The man you bastards tried to kill, Lance Corporal Tsudo.
I've never forgiven you bastards for trying to kill me.
Today I'm going to kill you all!
I've waited long enough for my revenge.
Tsukamoto has already met his death.
Takashi is next!
Then, it's Taki!
Finally, Lieutenant Onishi.
Listen, I'm going to send you all to hell!
I'll be pleased to escort you there myself!
Hey, where is Ono?
He was just here.
I think he went to find the guy who left the tape.
- What?
Hey, let's call the police.
- Shut up!
What do you think would happen with the police?
They'd find out about our setup.
Well, let's cool off for now.
That guy isn't some kind of monster we should fear.
What's the matter?
- The tape is gone!
Bastard, who are you?
!
Lance Corporal Tsudo.
You heard the tape, didn't you?
I swore that I would make you all suffer.
Then you'll know what it feels like to be killed!
What's going on?
!
Damn it!
That's the guy who stole my uniform!
Kirioka!
Call the station!
Hello!
Operator!
This is headquarters...
This is headquarters...
Calling all cars...
Calling all cars...
We've received a report that the criminal broke through a roadblock in the Shibara Pier area.
The criminal's considered armed and dangerous.
The criminal's considered armed and dangerous.
Car 24, roger!
He went to the left!
Stop!
He couldn't have gone very far from here.
Hey!
Hey!
Lady!
Lady!
Are you alright?
Lady!
Hang in there!
Hey!
Hey!
Lady!
Oh, Kirioka!
Is she okay?
- Yes.
The man we're looking for is up there.
He's trapped.
Fire!
Fire!
Hey, what do you think it was?
Well, I think it was a refrigeration unit.
It looks like some kind of power generator as well.
You don't seem to know very much about machines.
Neither do you.
Did you check with the building owners?
They didn't seem to know very much about this.
It's strange...
Everything here is burnt to destruction.
It must have been done to destroy clues.
How is it?
Find anything?
No, nothing good.
All we found was the uniform.
What did you learn at the cabaret?
The man who was killed there had an ID tag.
Huh?
Both of the men were killed with bayonets, and they both had ID tags.
Those ID tags seem to act like a death sentence.
I wonder if anyone else has these tags?
What?
You think there could be more murders?
No!
I don't want to die!
I'm going to the police!
- Fool!
If you talk to them, you'll ruin everything we've done!
But, I didn't have anything to do with his death!
I...
Who was the one who lit the dynamite?
It was you.
You're in this as much as we were.
Do you still want to talk to the police now?
Where are you going?
No!
I refuse to be chased all my life by him!
I'm from the police.
Please answer a few questions.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Your lives are in danger.
Does that sound good to you?
- Well, I...
- Taki!
We have nothing to say.
Please leave.
Onishi, what's the point in hiding things?
You'll be dead if you don't tell us.
Why won't you talk?
- I don't know!
There's nothing I can tell you!
I know about the ID tags.
Your waitress Tomi told me all about the delivery.
Please listen.
A policeman's job is more than arresting criminals.
We also protect people when there is a need.
How about it?
Would you want to talk to us?
- Well, I...
- Do you want to talk?
Taki...
I'll tell them.
It was fourteen years ago, August 15 the night of the surrender of Japan, and everything was in confusion.
By the army's order, we were assigned to transport Dr. Nikki, an army scientist.
We were to take him from Tokyo to a special mountain headquarters in Nagano but we didn't do it.
We took him to a different cave.
There were five of us in all.
Sergeant Tsukamoto, Doctor Nikki...
Lance Corporal Tsudo was on duty.
As well as Intelligence Officer Takashi, and myself.
Taki was waiting for us outside of the cave.
We had two boxes that were supposed to be full of Doctor Nikki's work but in reality...
Idiot!
Look at what you made me do!
- But sir, what is this?
!
Tsudo, hurry and put it back!
Just a moment!
Onishi, what is this?
It's a supply of gold bars.
What?
!
Then what about my research?
- Doctor, Japan has lost the war.
There's no further need for your research now.
The surrender has made a big change.
Money is the most important thing now.
It's every man for himself.
Bastard!
- Traitors!
You have betrayed the military!
Bastard!
This man is your superior!
- This traitor is not my superior!
This gold rightfully belongs to the people of our country!
The surrender does not give you any right to betray their trust!
Please take it back!
What?
!
If you don't take them back, I swear that I will kill you!
Hurry and get out!
I've lit the fuse to the dynamite!
Hurry!
Get down!
A year later, we got together and went back to the cave to find the gold bars.
But we couldn't find them.
The bodies of Dr. Nikki and Lance Corporal Tsudo had both disappeared.
That's impossible!
- Could it have been the wrong cave?
- No, I'm certain of it.
Did you leave a visual marker for it?
We'll we...
It was there.
It was there?
What was it?
It was Lance Corporal Tsudo's ID tag.
His ID tag?
He's after those guys, but it's their own fault.
Hey, regardless of who they are, all human life is precious.
Don't you think I know that?
I guess that means Tsudo and Doctor Nikki are both alive.
Well, it certainly appears that way.
Hey, stop here for a moment.
Well, what's this?
I hope you don't mind me dropping in like this.
- No.
Please come in and have a seat.
Well...
Did you get over the shock of that night?
- Yes, but I was really terrified when it happened.
My legs were weak with fright.
I'm really just a terrible weakling.
Anyone would have been scared in a situation like that.
I'd really like to thank you for your help.
No...
I'd also like to thank you for the flowers.
The flowers...
I hoped that you would like them.
Do you have any family members?
- Yes, they all live in the country.
They don't know what happened.
Really?
Well...
Well then, if you'll pardon me...
Oh, I forgot to offer you some tea.
I'm sorry.
- It... it's alright.
Some other time.
- But, it's no trouble.
- Really, it's okay.
Yes?
A delivery for you.
- Oh, who could it be from?
- Thank you!
They're flowers from a customer of the company.
Really?
I was worried that they might be from a fellow rival.
He visited me that morning to make sure his order of refrigeration units would be completed.
Refrigeration units?
That man will be missed.
If he were still alive, these would have been his best years.
So, why are you so interested in Dr. Nikki's work?
I understand that you and Dr. Nikki were researching the same field.
I want to talk about his work.
This is the information I've gathered so far.
Kajuro Nikki, born Meiji 31.
Before the war, he studied in the field of electrical engineering.
When the last war started, he joined the army technical laboratory to study electrical weapons.
He was reported missing after the war.
He was a bachelor, and he was known as an ultra-nationalist.
We would like to know more about Dr. Nikki's work on electrical weapons.
You see, the reason why we're asking you involves the activity of a criminal.
We're not sure, but we believe that the doctor's work may be related to the murders we're investigating.
Professor, please tell us.
Kirioka and I worked together on an article that discussed the idea of stereophonic TV, remember?
Yes.
Dr. Nikki's research was even more advanced than the studies being conducted today.
Even if the work on the stereophonic TV was completed the transmitted image could only be reproduced on a TV set.
You see, through Dr. Nikki's work, he was trying to produce a 3D image from a special transmitter.
In other words, matter itself would be transmitted.
When a person concentrates very intensely, he transmits brain waves.
It's also known as telepathy.
Now add to that, the coordination of the forces of mind and spirit.
From that, teleport-telekinesis is created.
Simply put people and things could be transmitted through space using this concept.
The advanced Yogi's of India believe it's one of the greatest mysteries ever demonstrated.
That may be a secret of Yoga, Professor, but we can already travel in space.
Their gods have nothing to do with it.
But before the idea of space travel came along, wasn't it something only a god could do?
However, with the advances we have made in science mankind has discovered how to travel into space.
Telepathy or teleport-telekinesis can be amplified electrically, and can be transmitted as well.
It's a complicated process and would require a man of great genius to conceive and construct a machine for it.
Hey, look at this.
This is a tele-transmitting machine.
This tower here looks just like this one.
It does seem very similar, doesn't it?
This part about the cooling system...
I'm sure that it's an important clue as well.
The Klyotron!
It won't work unless it's at a constant low temperature!
Don't forget the story about the cave the criminal's strange color, his body... voice...
When you put all of these facts together, it sounds like they're all connected in some way.
Let's assume Dr. Nikki and Tsudo are still alive.
The problem is, where are they now?
Welcome back.
Hey, I think they're at a place called Kotani.
Kotani, you say?
It's in Karuzawa.
I know they purchased four refrigeration units recently from the Nippo Seiki Company.
I heard it from Akiko.
Oh, she's the girl we met recently.
Why don't we go take a look around?
We've got nothing to lose from it.
Okay.
Hello, is this the Nippo Seiki Company?
I'd like to speak to Miss Chujo, please.
Yes.
What?
She's gone to Kotani?
She'll be leaving Ueno station at 12:15?
Thank you.
It's 11:47 now.
We have about thirty minutes.
Kobayashi, it finally came.
Huh?
- Taki got a tag with a note stating when he was going to die.
When?
- Today, between 11:30pm to midnight.
I've got him under protection.
Don't forget what I told you to say, I'm a repairman for the Nippo Seiki Company.
Is that okay?
- Yes.
It's a little scary.
- It's alright!
It's alright!
We're trying to locate the machines you want.
So far we haven't been able to come up with a single thing.
But we're still checking out every clue that you gave us.
What's the situation with Taki?
We've given him a police bodyguard for the moment.
Do you mind if I look at the refrigeration units?
You're very anxious to examine the cooling units.
I wonder why that is?
Well, it's my job with the company.
He's with our "After-Service" station.
I see...
Unfortunately, I don't have a problem with any of the refrigeration units.
All of the units are working perfectly.
Then why did you call us out here?
No, I only wanted to talk to Akiko Chujo.
I didn't know my call would have caused so much trouble.
Well, I can't let you go home this late at night.
It would be very difficult.
Well, I like to go to bed early.
Please use these two rooms for your accommodations tonight.
Well then, goodnight.
Damn...
I don't like anything about this place.
Hey, I wonder if Dr. Nikki is here or if he's still alive.
If he is, he's trying to avoid us.
That guy's actions have certainly raised my suspicions.
Well Akiko, try to get some sleep.
- And you, Kirioka?
I'm going to keep an eye on that guy.
Nothing to report.
Okasaki, thirty minutes to go.
I'm scared, Kirioka.
- What's the matter?
Did you hear that noise?
- Yes, it sounded like an earthquake.
It was so strange...
I know that nobody is around, but I feel like I'm being watched.
You're not tired enough to sleep yet?
What was that noise?
Oh, that noise came from the volcano.
It's become quite active recently.
It could erupt at any time.
- Delivery?
- Yes.
Okay.
Taki, try to relax a little bit.
Sure.
You'll be okay.
We've got policeman posted inside and outside in the yard around the place.
Nobody's going to get by all the men we have here.
What's inside the crate?
I think it's some kind of machine.
What?
A machine?
- It's probably a construction machine.
It was ordered by the Taki Construction Company for delivery tonight.
Okay, let's go there together.
I'm back.
There's a large truck with a machine for delivery.
Huh?
The driver said that it was to be delivered tonight.
No, I didn't order it!
Kobayashi, let's check it out.
The invoice, please.
What in the world could it be?
You should stay indoors, please.
- Quickly!
- Sure.
Where is the policeman who came with you?
He was just here a moment ago.
How about it officer?
Like a drink?
Damn it!
Okasaki, it's a trick!
What?
That way!
Damn it!
We should have caught him!
Alright!
Let's try to catch him now!
Hey, what do you see?
Not much, but I can see someone.
- Really?
I see you two are inspecting things.
Please return to your beds.
Chief...
I want to search the Kotani ranch thoroughly.
I agree, but the suspect had a perfect alibi.
We can't sit around and wait for the next murder to happen.
We've lost two policemen already!
Do you have any evidence to prove that Goro Nakamoto is Lance Corporal Tsudo?
Well, that is...
- I believe the two men are the same.
You said his alibi was perfect since he was seen between 11:30 and 12:00.
But this was to set up an alibi.
Don't forget the machine we found at the train wreck.
After all, it was the same type found at the first fire.
Therefore, I'm convinced that this is no coincidence.
Kirioka did you happen to see anyone there that might have resembled Dr. Nikki?
Yes, I'm sure I saw someone down there but I can't be sure if it was the doctor or not.
They must have suspected us though.
All of the doors that led to the lab were locked tight.
Is that so?
However, none of us would really know what Dr. Nikki looks like.
I believe that Professor Mura would recognize him if he saw him.
You would have made a good detective.
Any suggestions?
Give us a search warrant.
That way we'll find out what their machines are all about.
Chief!
Onishi seems to have disappeared.
Boss, I hope you don't plan on fishing.
Whatever you say.
It looks like some bad weather is blowing in.
- Buddy, we'll sit out a typhoon!
Well, well...
It's good to see you again!
You can go home.
We'll be fine.
- Really?
Well, then...
Boss, why did we come out here?
This place gives me the creeps.
You'd better have a seat, and then I'll tell you why.
There is a man after me.
Who is it?
- The bayonet murderer.
I doubt he'll be able to find me here.
Excuse me...
Wha... what is it, woman?
Yes, I almost forgot to tell you.
A letter arrived yesterday addressed to the master.
- What?
"The day after tomorrow, I will kill you at noon."
- Lance Corporal Tsudo
Leave!
Please go home!
Nakamoto...
No, I'm not sure of I should call you that, or Lance Corporal Tsudo.
Who is this Tsudo?
I don't know him!
I'm sure that you know who that person is.
I'm also sure that you're the bayonet murderer.
Stop with the jokes.
What evidence do you have to support your charges?
If you're Tsudo, we'll find out soon enough.
We have a search warrant for your house.
Step aside.
Let them come in and look around, please.
That voice?
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
Well, please look around.
Nikki!
It's you, isn't it, Nikki?
It's me!
It's Mura!
Mura?
!
It is you, Nikki!
You're still alive?
What happened to your legs?
This is what happened when some fools blew up the cave after the war.
Why didn't you tell me you were alive?
I would have helped you.
The nation that I knew had been shattered.
I felt that I was no longer wanted.
Dr. Nikki...
Have you completed your work on the matter-transmitting machine?
Who are you?
This is a student I taught.
He works as a journalist.
Now, about your research...
Yes, it's almost complete.
Do you know what this is?
It looks like a kind of vacuum tube.
What is it?
It is used in the process of matter transmission.
It melts like this when the electric waves get agitated.
As a result, the image can become distorted.
Then that's why we thought the face of the killer looked strange.
I'm sure he used a device like that.
Killer?
- That's right.
It's Nakamoto.
Did you find him?
- No, but someone else is coming.
Oh, that's Detective Morane.
Morane!
Did you happen to pass by anyone?
No, I didn't see anyone.
Okasaki, I've got a message from Tokyo headquarters that Onishi wants police protection.
- Onishi?
!
Where is he?
He's on an island near the Murazaki Peninsula.
The killer's note said that his sentence would be carried out by noon today.
I knew Tsudo was using my electric machinery, but not as a tool for murder.
Incredible...
I can't believe a man would use it for that purpose.
That man is very clever.
He appeared in Tokyo while he pretended he was still here.
He set up a perfect alibi for himself.
I still believe Tsudo will use the electric machinery to finish the job.
He'll be in Murazaki by noon.
I think that we should head out there.
We may find a way to head him off.
Nikki, I want you to come with me, for your own good.
I'll be alright.
I'm used to being on my own here.
Besides, all of my work is here, so please go ahead.
The typhoon is currently expected to bypass the Japan mainland.
Strong winds and dangerous seas will be a result of the typhoon as it makes its way past Western Japan.
Residents within the danger zone are asked to secure their homes and any boats for the storm.
Boss, we don't need the police with this incoming typhoon.
Boss, there's no way a boat can make it in these rough seas.
No, that guy will come here.
But really, boss...
Hey!
The typhoon is going to pass us!
The weather is still bad enough.
I'm just doing this to be safe.
The owner of the cottages is here tonight, huh?
Yes, but we won't be going fishing tonight in weather like this.
By the way did you tell him about the package that arrived from Tokyo not too long ago?
I forgot to tell him today.
I was going to tell him tomorrow.
I put it in the shed with the fishing net, so please be sure to tell him tomorrow.
I wish we didn't have this typhoon to deal with.
Yes, but at least it's getting better.
Hey, how long to get to Murazaki?
We should be there around 11:00.
That's about twenty minutes.
Hey, is something on your mind bugging you?
Yes, I think our man really didn't escape just so he could return to the laboratory.
The transmitter?
That's crazy!
- Inspector Hondo.
- Thank you for coming.
Have you had any luck finding the man we described?
- We thought we'd find him easily in a small town like this, but we couldn't.
I believe he isn't here.
What about the island?
There are about twenty houses on it but no boats are heading out to it due to the typhoon.
I'm sure that no boats went out there today.
Could you search all the warehouses and check for any strange machinery?
You haven't found it?
- Not anything unusual...
We have twenty minutes left.
Get us a boat right away.
- Yes, I'll get it at once.
I'll assemble a special guard for you.
- No.
The murderer isn't a normal human.
This man has no heart.
He's a devil with electricity running through his veins instead of blood!
Tsudo... it's you!
I didn't run away like everyone thought.
I hid myself in a room that even you don't know about.
Tsudo, I no longer want you as my assistant!
Leave my laboratory now!
I understand.
Wait!
Don't touch that!
How can you do this?
Shut up!
Boss!
A boat is coming in!
What?
!
I can't tell if it's the police.
Hey, go and find out!
Damn it!
Where could he be?
Outside!
Forgive me!
Stop, Tsudo!
Tsudo, there's nowhere to run.
- You think so, huh?
Damn!
Could he be in there?
Kobayashi, what's that noise?
Hey!
Something's wrong!
THE END
(horse whinnying)
Hyah!
Keep out of this, Cartwright!
We don't need you!
Stop her somebody!
Don't let her see this!
(screaming)
(screaming)
Why?
In the name of decency, Mrs. Buford, why?
Decency?
That girl's as guilty as her father and her brother were.
(theme song playing)
Well, how is she?
She's resting.
She's in deep shock.
I believe I could have made that diagnosis.
Now don't take your moral indignity out on me, Ben.
I don't mean to, Paul.
It's just when I think of people like that Mrs. Buford-- one of the so-called leaders of our town...
Give her these.
One every four hours.
The only thing else
I can prescribe for her is time.
How about prescribing a little kindness and affection?
About the kindest thing that could happen to Leta Malvet is for her to get out of Virginia City as soon as possible.
Give the people a chance to forget about the two men her father and brother murdered.
But when she leaves, she ought to go of her own free will, not because somebody threw rocks at her and drove her out.
You may be right, Ben.
Good-bye.
Whoa, boy.
What's the matter with you, Little Joe?
You trying to scare this horse half to death just when I get him tamed down?
Yeah, cut out the infernal shooting.
I was just practicing, older brother.
Well, put it back in your holster before I have to take it away from you and keep it until you grow up.
Well, you think you can?
Now what's all this racket?
Little Joe, next time you pull a stunt like that,
I'm going to put you up on that little sorrel.
Your baby son here is playing at stage robber.
Well, quiet down, the lot of you.
That girl in there needs her rest.
Now, look, Pa, if we're gonna start guarding those mine payroll shipments, we...
And keep quiet about that, too.
Well, who's going to hear me out here?
(horse approaching) Now never mind who's...
I can't say you're welcome on the Ponderosa, Renton.
I figured I wouldn't be.
Then why are you here?
To ask about Leta, that's all.
BEN:
I'll tell her you asked about her.
I'd sure like to see her, Mr. Cartwright.
I don't think that would be best.
I appreciate what you done for her, Mr. Cartwright.
I...
I just stopped by to say thanks and see how she was, that's all.
Pa.
Can't do no harm, it might do some good.
(sighs)
Come on then.
Take his horse.
Clay, I needed you.
I tried to find you.
I come as soon as I could get here, Leta.
I've been working at a ranch over at Washoe.
What am I gonna do, Clay?
I want to go away from Virginia City.
Running away is not going to help anything.
I found that out.
But the talk, Clay.
Facing them every day.
Long as you know the talk is lies, it can't hurt you, Leta.
First thing you got to do is forget the talk.
Ain't that right, Mr. Cartwright?
Well, the, uh... the doctor did say she needed a lot of rest.
Sure.
I'll be around any time you need me, Leta.
You know that.
Now, you get a lot of rest just like the doctor said.
Good to see you, Joe.
You and me used to have a lot of good times together, huh?
Yeah, we did.
Thanks.
Thanks, all of you.
Well, that's all we need-- somebody like Clay Renton snooping around.
I don't think he's snooping around, Adam.
I think he meant what he said.
You know, he's just a little bit older than I am, and he's already got two prison terms behind him.
Yes, and about eight or ten more ahead of him, more than likely.
Pa, don't you think maybe you ought to talk to her about him?
Son, there's one thing that a man can't do, and that's tell a woman who to love and who not to love.
Yeah, I reckon not.
You boys have nothing to do?
Yeah, come on, Little Joe.
Well, what's on your mind?
The girl.
She's been here three days now.
What are you going to do about her?
What do you want me to do, throw her out while that mob in Virginia City is still in a lynching mood?
We have an obligation to ourselves, too.
Such as?
Guarding the payroll shipments.
Whether we like it or not, the only associates
Leta's ever had in her life have been outlaws.
Now I just don't like the idea of somebody like Clay Renton hanging around the Ponderosa.
I suppose you're right.
Why don't you do something for a change and rustle me up something to eat, huh?
Who took care of you before I was around?
Where do you think you've been?
If I thought it was any of your business, I'd tell ya.
I warned you for the last time, Clay--
I'm running this shebang-- all the way.
Yeah, you're running it just fine.
You have us hold up an empty stage,
Malvet and his boy kill a guard and a driver and get hung for it.
What'd we get out of that job, Spence?
It's been a long time since we picked up any money, boss.
We came here to get a slice of that mine payroll money.
I don't care if it takes six months-- we ain't gonna go off half-cocked and get our necks stretched like Malvet and the boy did.
They ain't carrying that payroll on the stages anymore, but they're still getting it through.
You got no idea how they're doing it, huh?
I suppose you have?
If I was running this outfit, I'd find out.
Well, you ain't running it!
I kind of go along with your thinking, kid.
But you ought to have better sense then try to outdraw Spence.
Thanks for taking care of my chickens, Hoss.
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
I plumb enjoyed it.
Me and them chickens got to calling each other by first names.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I sold some of your eggs to Mr. Buford, and here's the money.
(sobbing)
Now, there ain't no cause for that.
Nobody's ever been as good to me as you folks have.
Well, we-- we better get this little lady home.
Good-bye, Miss Leta.
It's best to be home.
Oh, I don't mean I don't appreciate all of the...
Oh, I understand, Leta.
I'll go in with you, see that everything is all right.
Oh, no.
I mean, I left it so quick and all--
I guess it looks pretty awful, don't it?
Leta, you do believe that I want to help you every way I can, don't you?
You and the boys think maybe I ought go away from here, don't you?
I think it would be best.
Mr. Cartwright, I haven't got anyplace to go.
Do you have any plans then?
Well, I've got my chickens.
Mr. Buford buys all my eggs.
I can make a living.
I've been doing it for three years now.
And I never took a penny of the money my dad and brother stole.
You got to believe that, Mr. Cartwright.
Oh, I do believe you, Leta, but you know, there are some folks that won't.
Well, then I'll-- I'll make 'em believe it.
I'll stand up and face 'em, and make 'em know it's true.
Well, if that's what you think is best for you to do, Leta,
I'll do everything I can to help you.
It's what I have to do, Mr. Cartwright.
Clay was right.
Running away won't do any good.
(clicking tongue)
Welcome home, Leta.
Clay, what are you doing here?
Who's got a better right?
What's the matter?
A week with those high and mighty Cartwrights make you too good for me?
It's not that, Clay.
What is it?
It's just that... that you take me for granted.
Take you for granted?
You think I thought of anything but you every day of those three years I was in jail?
I'm sorry, Clay.
Let's not talk about it now.
Let's just remember that it's over now, and we can get a fresh start on things.
You bet we will.
We'll have lots of good times together, too.
It's-It's more than that, Clay.
It's-It's having people look up to you and it's walking down the street knowing that nobody's talking about you behind your back.
Wait a minute.
What did those Cartwrights do to you, anyway?
They treated me like a lady.
(chuckling)
Well, honey, ain't you one?
Come here.
It's been a long time, Leta.
Don't let those Cartwrights give you any fancy ideas.
They ain't like us.
They treated me good.
But I'm your kind.
And don't you ever forget it.
HARVEY:
I told them we wouldn't pay a penny more than $25 for all the decorations.
BOYD:
You always were a sharp trader, Harvey.
(Harvey and Boyd laughing)
(whispering) I buy eggs from her.
Fresh eggs are hard to come by.
You get them where you can.
Well, I guess everything is in order, then, Harvey.
Be the best bazaar we ever had.
No doubt about it.
My wife has worked day and night.
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye ,Boyd.
Well, Leta, so you brought me some more eggs.
There's six dozen there.
You can count them.
Well, now, I...
I could take your word for it.
I wouldn't have to count them.
They'd look awful pretty on you, Leta.
I never seen any that pretty before.
And just your size, too.
If you're finished counting them,
I'll take my pay for the eggs now.
You ought to have these shoes, Leta.
I can't afford them.
If you'll give me the pay, Mr. Buford.
You can afford them, Leta.
You got a pair of shoes, Leta.
I told you I couldn't afford them.
I just want to be nice and friendly.
I could come out to your cabin of an evening once in a while.
and-and pick up the eggs.
Oh!
She came at me like a tiger.
I caught her trying to steal.
These!
You dirty liar.
Stop it.
Honey, they tried to rob me.
I saw it all.
She's a thief, just like the rest of her family.
Take me home, Clay.
Please take me home.
Come on.
We gonna just let them go?
You got your shoes back, didn't you?
Honey, it's like I told you, she tried to rob me.
I said I saw it all, didn't I?
Anybody interested in a $50,000 load of fire wood?
I'd be interested in your keeping quiet about it.
Any trouble?
Not a bit.
No.
Well, there's apt to be if those outlaws are still around and they find out how we're getting the payroll across the Ponderosa.
Now we got to figure out something different for next week.
Listen, Adam.
Little Joe had a real good idea.
Here's what we're going to do.
He's gonna put on a beard, see?
Then we're going to get in the covered wagon and come out here like we're looking for land.
Yeah, see, then we put him in a real nice bonnet and a print dress.
Mm-hmm.
How did I ever get tangled up with you two?
(laughing)
You're just plain lucky, older brother.
Well, there it is.
$50,000 in cold minted cash.
What I could do with that at the big charity bazaar next week.
Well, now, I wouldn't worry about it too much, 'cause you're not going to be at the charity bazaar.
Yeah?
Why not?
You'll be right here on one of these payroll wagons.
You get in trouble there, it'll be constructive trouble.
You get in trouble in town, it'll be just plain trouble.
Hey, Pa, Adam says I can't go to the bazaar.
That's right, son.
But neither can Adam.
He's going to be riding the wagon right alongside you.
ADAM:
Oh, now, Pa.
Hoss and I will represent the Cartwright family at the bazaar.
I'm trustworthy.
All right, come on.
Let's unload the wagon.
Why?
Why don't you listen to me?
'Cause I don't like it.
It wouldn't hurt to listen, Spence.
We can't be no worse off than we are now.
All right, so you found out how it's done.
What are you going to do about it?
What's the matter, Spence?
You gone yellow?
I've gone smart.
I'm going to wait for the right time.
These nags of ours ain't had a bait of oats in a month.
What are you gonna do, get these horses of ours ready by next Wednesday?
I'm gonna buy fresh horses.
With what?
Money.
Money.
Out of the safe in Harvey Buford's store.
With half of Virginia City looking over your shoulder?
They won't be.
I take time to think things out.
Now, listen.
There's a bazaar starting up in a couple of days.
Every thing shuts down except the saloons.
Nah.
Be good to have some money to go on, Spence.
No!
Why?
Because you didn't think of it?
Because I don't want no part of a cheap two-bit hold up.
I came here after big money and that's what I'm gonna get.
I told you before, boy.
You think too small.
You been living on egg money too long.
We're gonna do things my way this time, Spence.
What's the little boy trying to do?
Grow up to man size?
He ain't trying.
He just did.
(chuckling)
Clay, it's getting dark out.
It's time to wake up.
I'm awake.
Come here.
I guess I just don't know how to say this right, Leta.
But there, in Buford's store, when he accused you,
I knew it then.
I can't stand to see you face it alone anymore.
I can't stand to be alone.
I love you, Leta.
I love you and I need you.
Oh, Clay.
Oh.
I waited so long to hear somebody say that.
I know folks around here are going to talk against me, but...
But if I knew you was waiting, I...
Oh, I will, Clay.
I promise you, I will.
I can go away for a while and get a little money ahead...
Oh, that isn't important, Clay.
Yes, it is, honey.
It's important to a man.
A man likes to feel like he's taking care of his wife.
I'll get it.
Of course you will.
I hope you won't change your mind, Leta.
Like if those Cartwrights start talking against me.
They don't like me coming out here to see you.
But I do, Clay.
That's all that matters.
Anybody home?
Hoss!
Hello!
Hi, Miss Leta.
I just brung that chicken feed into town for you.
Sure big things doing in Virginia City today.
Getting ready for that bazaar meeting.
Got the streets all decorated and the booths all set up.
(chuckles)
Say, Miss Leta, you-you sure do look pretty, ma'am.
Oh, do you like it?
I made it myself.
Sure enough?
Well it's-it's mighty pretty, ma'am.
It's the first time I ever tried.
Really?
Listen, you keep that up, and you're liable to take first place at that dress making contest at the bazaar one of these days.
Oh, Hoss.
Do you think so?
Do you really think so?
Well, ma'am, like you said, it is your first one.
And I reckon...
I reckon it takes a lot of practice to really sew good.
Hoss, when I was sick...
when I was over at your house... you said that I could talk to you any time, tell you anything I wanted to.
Yes, ma'am, and I meant it, too.
Well, I want to show you something.
I have to tell you.
It's in here.
Sit down, Hoss.
Yes'm.
Now, close your eyes.
Yes'm.
Ah-ah-ah!
Now.
Hey.
That's a wedding dress, ain't it, Miss Leta?
Yes, it's a wedding dress.
I made it all myself.
It's my wedding dress!
You made it for your hope chest.
I heard about gals making stuff for their hope chest.
It sure is pretty, Miss Leta.
I'm going to enter it in the contest, Hoss.
And I'm going to be married in it, in the best church in Virginia City, and I'm going to walk down the main street of that town and let everybody look at me and I'll be so proud
and everybody will say, "There goes Mrs. Clay Renton."
(giggling)
You and Clay Renton?
He asked me, Hoss.
I wasn't supposed to say nothing, but I been just bursting inside with wanting to tell somebody about it.
Clay's gonna get a job.
A real fine job.
Yes'm.
It ain't like I hadn't known him for a long time.
No, no.
I know he's had trouble, but then, so have I.
I want to start all over again and so does Clay.
Don't you see that's what makes it so good, Hoss?
Yes'm.
I reckon I do.
Ain't you gonna wish me happiness, Hoss?
Yes'm, Miss Leta.
I wish you all the happiness in the world.
You and Clay both.
Bye, Miss Leta.
(rooster crows)
* Da dee dee-dee-dee dee
* Da dum dee
* Oh, da-da dum.
MRS. BUFORD:
Well, good-bye, Mr. Boyd.
Come again.
Oh, Mr. Cartwright?
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Cartwright, over here.
Over here.
Hello, Mrs. Buford.
Looks like your bazaar is going to be a great success.
Well, I've worked very hard at it.
I'm sure you have.
Nice to see you.
Oh, Mr. Cartwright, I want to thank you for your generous contribution.
Oh, not at all.
Not at all.
Good cause.
Oh, and, Mr. Cartwright--
I was wondering if you would, uh...
If I would judge the dress making contest again this year?
No, Mrs. Buford, never, never again.
You ladies take this way too serious for me.
But thank you very much for asking.
Much obliged.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, ma'am.
(sighs)
Let's get over to the Last Dollar, see what the boys are up to, huh?
Pa, don't you think it's a little bit early to start celebrating?
Early?
What, for a couple of young bucks like us?
(loud scraping)
What's the matter?
$50?
A lousy $50.
There should be more.
I thought there'd be more.
You thought.
We risk getting our necks stretched for $50.
Take it easy.
I'll figure out something.
BOYD:
Harvey, Harvey, don't tell me you're going to open up today?
Oh, I have to get something for my wife.
Boyd, it's been sort of up to you and me to head up things around here.
Something wrong, Harvey?
(footsteps approaching)
Well, what do you think we ought to do, Harvey?
I don't know.
My wife thinks she ought to be run out of town.
Me and the rest of the committee will back you up.
You know that, Harvey.
Spence was right about you.
You do think small.
Eric, let's get out of here.
(door opening)
(pistol cocking)
Clay Renton.
I had to come pick this up for my wife.
I didn't figure on you being here today.
Turn around.
Hmm?
Turn around, walk.
(blows landing)
Mrs. Buford.
Mrs. Buford, wait a minute, Mrs. Buford.
I've got an entry for the dress making contest.
Now, now, ladies, if you can get your menfolk quieted down.
Now, ladies...
Mrs. Buford.
Now ladies, as you know...
I got an entry.
What is it, child?
I made a dress.
I want to enter it.
I was afraid I'd be late.
Clay was supposed to come by and get me, but he plumb forgot.
I guess that's just like a man, though.
It's kind of crumpled, but I stuck by all the rules, Mrs. Buford.
I bought the material right here in town like the rules say.
I traded eggs for it.
You can ask your husband, Mrs. Buford.
And it ain't no boughten' pattern either.
I made it my own self.
It's my wedding dress, Mrs. Buford.
(crowd murmuring)
I guess that was just an accident, Mrs. Buford.
I guess you just couldn't help it.
I said I want to enter my wedding dress in the contest.
The entries are closed.
To everybody, Mrs. Buford, or just to me?
If you had been on time,
I would have been glad to accept your entry.
You're a liar, Mrs. Buford, and everybody here knows it.
(crowd murmuring)
I know I ought to hate you, but I don't.
I just feel sorry for you.
You know, this is really nice.
I wish the boys could be here with us.
Yeah.
Did you see the expression on old Adam's face when you told him he couldn't come?
(both laughing)
Leta...
Leta, what happened?
What happened?
I just found out where I belonged, that's all.
Now wait a minute, Leta.
For what?
(door opening)
Clay Renton.
Get a doctor, somebody.
Hoss.
Find Adam and Little Joe.
Get some of the men together from the sawmill, spread them out and cut off all the trails between here and the Ponderosa.
I'll get some men together here to follow out the Gold Hill and Peavine Springs roads.
I'll meet you at the Ponderosa later.
Yes, sir.
We've all got good ropes, Ben.
We know how to use 'em.
Yes, I guess you would, Boyd.
You've had practice.
(hoofbeats approaching)
How are things in town?
Ugly.
Hoss said you sent the posse up toward Peavine.
A lynch mob would be more like it.
Well, I doubt if they'll find anything to lynch out that way.
You picked up a trail then?
I figured you would.
There must have been three others besides Clay Renton.
What makes you so sure it was Clay Renton?
Well, Hoss said...
That Harvey Buford had mentioned Clay's name.
I'm not going to condemn a man until I have a lot more to go on then that.
You talked to Leta?
Not yet.
We found where four men had been camped.
It looked like they'd been there for some time.
Followed a trail up along Manzanita Ridge and we ran out of daylight.
They headed up to the lake, then, huh?
Well, three of them are, anyway.
You boys follow on along the ridge.
Then circle back to the Malvet place.
Sure you want to go alone?
I'm sure.
(coyote howling)
Well, I guess we lost 'em.
I doubt it.
(rifle cocking)
(pistol cocking) HOSS:
I wouldn't do that, boys.
Just leave them peashooters right where they are and be sensible about this.
It was Clay Renton beat up that storekeeper.
I swear it was.
Now, the safe was robbed.
You got the money with you?
You know what was in that safe?
$50.
That's what was in it.
Cartwright, listen to me.
Let me explain it.
Oh, you'll have all kinds of time to explain.
What do you want to do with them, Adam?
Take them back to town where there's a jail to hold 'em.
Then we'll swing back around Leta's place like Pa told us.
$50?
Was it worth it, boys?
(sobbing)
(hoofbeats approaching)
(hoofbeats stop)
Clay, what's the matter?
The way you came riding in here just now like something had happened?
I used to see my own father and brother ride in here like that.
I felt bad about not being here to take you to the bazaar like I promised.
I just wanted to see you and explain.
Maybe I rode a little too hard.
Clay, I heard about it-- everybody did.
About what?
Harvey Buford.
(hoofbeats approaching)
(horse whickers)
Who is it?
It's me Ben Cartwright.
(whispers):
You won't need that.
Who's with you, Mr. Cartwright?
I'm alone.
Oh, I, uh, I came here because I'd like to talk to you, Leta.
About Clay.
You've already made up your mind about him, haven't you?
No, I haven't made up my mind about any...
Yes, you have.
All of you have.
Somebody gives Harvey Buford the beating he's always deserved, and everybody blames Clay.
Clay wasn't even in town.
BEN:
Well, if Clay wasn't in town and he can prove that, then there's nothing to worry about.
But he'll have to prove it, won't he?
Well, shouldn't he?
Why should he?
Why should he get down on his hands and knees and come crawling to you?
Is it because his name is Renton and not Cartwright?
Now you know that isn't so.
Why is everyone getting so excited?
Every day a man gets a beating in Virginia City and nobody turns a head.
Leta, this is more than a beating.
Harvey Buford's store was robbed.
Harvey Buford is dead.
Do you understand what I said?
A man has been killed.
My father and my brother were killed, too.
And I know who did it.
A whole town full of your kind of people is guilty of that crime.
Why don't you go knock on their doors in the middle of the night?
Clay Renton is suspected of murder.
Clay is not guilty!
If you're so sure of that, then what are we fighting about?
He's all alone against all the rest of you and I know how that feels.
I know you do.
And I want to help you.
I can't turn against him, Mr. Cartwright, not when he needs me most.
I'm not asking you to turn against him.
I'm asking you not to turn against yourself.
What is it you want of me?
If Clay comes here, don't get into trouble by trying to protect him.
If he comes and asks me, I'll have to give him my help.
Then you'd be putting yourself on the opposite side of the fence from everybody.
I guess I would, but it would be on the side where I belong.
I'm a Malvet, and there's one thing the Malvet women could always be proud of.
They always stood up for the men they loved.
Thank you for helping me find my own place, Mr. Cartwright.
(horse neighing)
All right.
You can come out now, Clay.
He's gone.
Yeah, I guess he has.
Did you think I'd lie to you?
No.
I can trust you, Leta.
I was proud of the way you talked up to him.
We got to get out of here.
You got a gunny sack or something?
We'll need a few supplies.
Here.
Start filling it up.
I'll keep an eye on the window.
I didn't know Harvey Buford was dead.
He got what he deserved.
When I think of him putting his hands on you...
Mr. Cartwright said the store was robbed.
I heard him say that.
Did you hear him say it or did you already know it?
How could I know it?
I told you I wasn't in town, didn't I?
Throw some grub in that sack.
We got a long, hard ride ahead of us.
What are we running from, Clay?
That's a fine question, coming from you.
You heard old man Cartwright, didn't you?
He's already made up his mind I'm guilty.
But if you're not...
Well, what difference does that make in this town?
Do you think they'd listen to me or you?
Honey, look.
Don't you know how I've dreamed about this?
You and me getting a fresh start?
We can't do it here.
They won't give us a chance.
Hurry up, now.
(softly):
Pa.
(softly):
Adam.
Is Clay in there?
Yeah.
His horse is back there.
We caught the other three.
Took them back to town.
There's no doubt about Clay's being guilty, Pa.
Oh, I guess I knew it all along.
So does the rest of the town now.
Does anybody know where you were headed?
It wouldn't be very hard to figure out, would it?
We've got to get Clay out of there before that mob gets here.
We'll have another lynching on our hands.
Well, Hoss and Little Joe are around back.
We could rush him.
No, we can't.
Leta's in there with him.
Clay, I have to know the truth.
Did you rob Buford's store?
Why don't you stop deviling me about it?
You didn't answer me!
You got to tell me the truth!
Did you rob Buford's store?
Did you steal that pair of shoes?
Let's move in a little closer.
(rustling outside)
There's somebody out there.
Renton!
Clay, my boys and I are out here alone.
Now, if you come out,
I promise you we'll see you get a fair deal!
No, Clay!
No!
You think you can trust those Cartwrights?
We've got to trust somebody, can't you see that?
You think they're out there alone?
Listen.
(many people speaking indistinctly
(voices growing louder, horses approaching)
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Listen to me.
The girl's in there with him.
We want her too, Cartwright!
(shot firing)
We'll get out of here, honey.
Just do what I say.
Out the back way.
We'll both start shooting at the same time.
Then what, Clay?
Leave that to me.
We're going to have a good life together.
We're going to enjoy some of the good things other people have.
Everything we've always wanted.
Let's go.
Everything, Clay?
You won't have to wear homemade dresses, either.
Not with me, you won't.
I'm going to buy you the finest wedding dress you ever had.
You did kill Harvey Buford, didn't you?
Come on, Leta.
Let's go.
I'm not going, Clay.
What?
You couldn't turn on me, Leta.
Now, put away that gun.
Honey, what are you trying to do?
Put that gun away, Clay.
Mr. Cartwright?
I hear you, Leta.
I want to do what is right, Mr. Cartwright.
There'll be no deals with that woman, Cartwright.
What do you want to do, Leta?
If I bring Clay out without his gun, will you promise me that he won't be lynched?
I promise, Leta.
How do you expect to keep that promise, Cartwright?
You'll have to shoot me in the back to make me break it.
Ooh, that was smart of you, Leta.
Old Man Cartwright went for it.
They wouldn't dare shoot as long as you're with me.
Look, I'll put the gun in my boot, huh?
We're gonna make a great team, honey, you and me.
We're going to have a good life together.
They're not going to be able to stop us.
None of them.
You wait and see.
As soon as I get clear of the cabin,
I'll make a break for a horse.
Okay?
Let's go.
Leta kept her end of the bargain.
I'll use my gun if I have to.
Look in his boot.
(moaning)
I would have got one of those payrolls away from you, Cartwright.
I had it all figured out.
That's what I was after.
Just one big one.
Just one big one.
Clay.
You had a chance at something much bigger than a payroll.
(sobbing)
Tell the girl if there's anything we can do...
Is there anything you want to do?
I would like her to know how sorry I am.
How very, very sorry.
Then why don't you tell her that, Mrs. Buford?
( noirish jazz theme playing )
WOMAN:
Left.
( slow, tense theme playing )
Once.
Three-one.
Right... twice.
Fifty-five.
Left.
Ten.
What's in there?
Nothing.
What's going to be in there Sunday night?
Over a hundred thousand dollars.
I hope.
One hundred and thirty thousand.
In cash.
What about the watchman?
Oh.
Well, he starts his rounds on the hour.
Takes him 12 minutes.
He ends up right back where he started from.
His room at the front of the entrance.
That's why I go through the front gate at 5 after 11?
That's right.
Now then, what are you gonna do?
I take the money out, put it in my bag and close the safe.
And then get out.
You'll wait.
You'll wait in between the buildings until you see the watchman start his midnight rounds.
Right?
Then what?
Well, then we follow our plan.
You've already left on another buying trip.
I meet you in the cabin in the Sierras.
( upbeat theme playing )
Yeah, going to use the company plane this trip, Howard?
You know I love to fly, Mr. Taylor.
I'd hoped my son could take over some of this traveling for you.
Give you a chance to relax behind your desk.
Give him the experience he needs in the field.
Don't you worry, Mr. Taylor.
I'm sure he'll get it.
Yeah.
The only experience Andy's getting is how to shoot craps in Vegas... and how to be irritating and stubborn with me.
Well, I think he's just a little young, impetuous.
How long do you stay young and impetuous?
Boy eight years out of college and married... ought to have some sense of responsibility.
The fights we've had lately...
I've tried to be a good father.
WOMAN:
Have you, Mr. Taylor?
How do you expect Andy to assume responsibility... when all he ever hears from you is how untrustworthy he is?
And what does he hear from you, Carol?
How to be a patient, dutiful son and wait for the inheritance?
I know you think I married Andy for your money.
Well, what did you marry him for?
To reform him?
To get him over the habit of signing my name to checks?
To stop his gambling?
Hasn't been a very successful marriage, has it?
Perhaps with a little understanding--
Andrew wasn't ready for marriage, young lady.
You rushed him into it.
I understand that much.
What are you up here for now?
Mr. Walters...
Andy and I are leaving for dinner at the club.
I thought perhaps my father-in-law would join us.
Well...
my wife's waiting.
She's driving me to the airfield.
I left that Fresno account for Andy to take care of on Monday.
He'll be there...
if I have to pour him on the morning plane myself.
( chuckles )
Well, everything else is under control, Mr. Taylor.
I'll be calling you the first part of the week.
Fine, Howard, fine.
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
It just seems as though we don't have a life together anymore.
It's a short trip this time.
I wish you wouldn't fly yourself.
I prefer it.
It isn't safe.
Well...
look at all the insurance you stand to collect if anything happens.
Don't say things like that.
All right, Ruth.
Howard.
I'll call you.
( plane flying overhead )
( grunts )
Be careful.
Sure.
Go on now.
( dramatic theme playing )
The plane is gassed and ready.
I'm leaving now.
WOMAN:
All right, dear.
Nervous?
Yes.
But I'll be all right Sunday night.
I'll be fine.
Oh, sure you will.
It'll go without a hitch, just like we rehearsed it.
I'll meet you Monday, 4:00, at the mountain cabin.
A new life, Janice.
Love me?
Darling... you know I do.
Bye.
Bye, Howard.
See you Monday.
( line clicks dead )
( slow, dramatic theme playing )
You won't.
But I will.
What a surprise he'll find up at that cabin.
Instead of Janice, his darling... me.
Instead of $130,000 dollars, a .32 slug.
Mayday.
Mayday, mayday.
This is 14536... 14536.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
MAN ( over radio ):
This is Merced Airport.
This is Merced Airport.
We receive your transmission, 14536.Over.
I hear you, Merced.
This is Walters.
Howard Walters, Los Angeles.
All oil pressure lost.
Impossible to set her down.
Over.
Walters, state your position.
Please state your position.
Where are you bound for?
Over.
Fresno to Portland.
Losing altitude.
Dropping fast.
I'm on fire!
On fire!
I'm gonna crash!
I'm crashing!
Tell my wife-- Tell my wife--
( bangs on radio )
( suspenseful theme playing )
( grunting )
Oh, clumsy, blundering fool.
Ouch.
( panting )
( grunting )
( slow, dramatic theme playing )
( groans )
( stamps feet )
( fire crackling )
( man whispers indistinctly )
WALTERS ( whispering ):
Janice.
Hundred and thirty thousand.
Janice.
Janice.
Yeah.
( wind gusting outside )
Oh!
You better lay quiet, mister.
Your leg's busted.
( groans )
How long have I been here?
Almost two days.
Two days.
Oh, I've got to get out of here.
Help me get up.
You ain't goin' no place, mister.
You're just lucky I found you and brung you home, and took care of your busted leg.
Who are you?
Zack Davis.
What's your handle?
Not a solitary thing in your belongings to tell me, stranger.
Have you got a car?
Car?
Yeah.
Mister, there ain't no way in or out of this place excepting' on a shank's pony.
We're smack in the middle of no place.
( sighs )
We got no roads, no neighbors, no nothin'.
Where'd you find me?
This side of the ridge.
I was out prospectin' with Daisy.
She's my burro.
I reckon you traveled a far piece with that busted leg.
Look.
Help me get to a phone.
There ain't no phone for miles.
And you can't move till that leg sets.
Well, how long will that be?
It don't matter how long.
You'll be here till spring, anyhow.
Spring?
No, I can't!
Well, it don't matter.
We'll be snowed in all winter.
I Hope you like cribbage, mister.
Sure helps pass the time.
( dramatic theme playing )
Oh.
( sighs )
MASON:
And it's now seven weeks since your husband disappeared?
CAROL:
Yes, Mr. Mason.
I wanted to notify the police immediately... but my father-in-law wouldn't let me.
Why?
Well... you see, the Sunday that Andy disappeared, a hundred and thirty thousand dollars was stolen from the office safe.
And your father-in-law thought that Andy might have stolen the money?
Yes.
Oh, I know there were many things that Andy did before we were married that weren't right, but he never stole.
Haven't you heard from him in all this time?
No.
That's why I'm so worried.
All the other times he would--
Other times?
( sighs )
Twice before he went away.
After arguments with his father.
But he'd call me, and I'd talk to him, and he'd come back.
I see.
Now, uh... just how did you want me to help you, Mrs. Taylor?
Mr. Mason, I'm so worried.
I think something might have happened to Andy.
An accident--
You want me to make inquiries?
Perhaps call in a private investigator?
Oh, yes.
Please.
You understand that in finding him, it may uncover the fact that he did steal the money?
Yes.
I understand.
Do you have any family, Mrs. Taylor?
Just a cousin.
Roger Porter.
Della, see if you can set up a--
An appointment with Mr. Wade Taylor.
Make it this afternoon if possible.
Mm.
Here?
No.
I think I'd like to see him in his own surroundings.
A privilege, Mr. Mason.
Mr. Taylor.
I'd like to talk to you about your son.
So Carol went to you.
At least she didn't go to the police.
Did she tell you about the money?
Yes.
And what does you want you to do, find him before the money's all gone?
No.
She's concerned over his welfare.
Not hearing from him, she thinks maybe he might have been hurt or something might have happened to him.
Forgive me, Mason.
I have no such fears.
Have you heard from him?
No.
Would you tell me why you suspect him of stealing?
I don't suspect.
I know.
He took $130,000 out of that safe in the outer office.
No question about it?
Only three people knew the combination.
My general manager, Howard Walters.
My son, Andrew.
And myself.
I see.
What about this Walters?
He couldn't have taken the money, Mason.
He was out of town when it happened.
As a matter of fact, he telephoned me the evening of the robbery, from Fresno.
And that leaves only Andrew and yourself?
And I didn't rob myself.
Why didn't you report the robbery?
And put my son in jail?
Insurance companies aren't noted for sentiment.
Then you are taking the loss?
My loss is my son.
I thought there was some hope for him.
I know now...
there isn't.
Yes.
I will, thank you.
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
They found the plane.
The snows melting, uh, gave the search party a chance to get up there.
What about Walters?
Uh-
- Apparently, he never bailed out.
They found his body badly charred.
Thanks, Roger.
Oh, Roger Porter, Perry Mason.
How do you do?
Hello.
You're Carol Taylor's cousin, aren't you?
Uh, that's right.
I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Walters.
When was the crash?
Seven weeks ago.
In the High Sierras.
Around the time of the theft?
Well, the next day, I believe.
A good man.
You were about to tell me where to start the search for your son.
Why not just wait, Mason?
He'll come home with his tail between his legs as soon as the money's all gone.
( slow, dramatic theme playing )
( door closes )
Thorough check on the last seven weeks.
Former girlfriends, associates, gambling, nightspots.
Here, Las Vegas and in Reno.
With special emphasis on whether or not he's been flashing a roll?
Mm-hm.
And about that plane crash--
I have a preliminary report on that one.
Uh, a small private plane reported an oil leak to the Merced Airport at 2:12 p.m.,
Monday, January 26th.
Crashed, burned and snowbound.
A search party reached the plane this morning.
The body is being sent to Los Angeles at the wife's request.
Paul, before you do anything else,
I want you to drop in on Lieutenant Tragg.
Just drop in at headquarters?
Uh, with a suggestion.
I wanna make sure an autopsy is performed on that body.
One that covers all possible causes of death.
( slow, mysterious theme playing )
( sighs )
I can't understand it.
What could've happened?
Howard faked the whole thing, why didn't he bail out?
I don't know, and I don't care.
Roger, it's been seven weeks.
How much longer do we have to wait?
We played it safe.
We got the money stashed away.
We don't wanna get careless now.
Oh, darling.
Just think... $130,000... split two ways.
One way, baby.
One way?
Share and share alike, remember?
In everything.
( ominous theme playing )
( sighs )
WALTERS:
Hello, Janice.
Well, don't I get a welcome-home kiss?
( dramatic theme playing )
I called a half-a-dozen times.
No one answered.
( grunts ) Mm, Howard, I--
I had just given up all hope.
Why didn't you let me know?
Oh, I couldn't.
I bailed out all right, but I broke my leg when I landed.
Then I got snowed in.
Everybody thinks you're dead.
Well, isn't that how we planned it?
Where's the money?
In a safety-deposit box.
Oh.
Good girl.
No one suspects?
No.
No, it... went off just perfectly.
Well, fine.
We'll take the money out tomorrow, get away just the way we planned... only, uh, seven weeks later.
( sighs )
Say, have you got anything to eat in this place?
Howard, you can't stay here.
Why not?
Well, a girl from the office is coming to spend the night here.
Don't you have any place to stay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I checked in at the Valley Vista Motel in North Hollywood.
Under the name of Henry Morrison.
Seems like I, uh--
I really surprised you.
( scoffs )
Uh, you did.
The search party reached the plane.
Well?
It burned up, didn't it?
Not completely.
They recovered a body.
So what?
I thought it was you.
It wasn't.
If I can't stay here... you come with me.
Howard.
We mustn't take any chances.
And if my girlfriend came in here and found you here, sh--
All right.
All right, I can wait another day.
I'll call you later... and set up the arrangements for tomorrow morning.
Howard.
Yeah?
Who was in that plane?
We thought the body found in the plane was Howard Walters, of course.
We even asked his wife and his employer,
Mr. Taylor, to come to the identification.
And then the body was definitely identified, not as Walters, but as Andrew Taylor.
And Wade Taylor made the identification of his son?
That's right.
He told us to look for a false tooth, some special dentistry, and the evidence of a mastoid operation, which we found.
What about the autopsy?
The body wasn't completely consumed by flames.
Andrew Taylor died of a .32-caliber bullet through his heart.
Which made it murder.
How'd you know, Perry?
I didn't.
How did you guess?
More of a hunch, lieutenant.
What's your interest in this case?
I don't know if I have an interest at all now.
May be finished.
( rings )
Hello.
Hello?
Mrs. Taylor?
Yes?
Uh--
Who is this?
I'm sorry, but the line isn't clear.
If you would like evidence that your husband did not steal that money from his father's safe, you can find it at the Valley Vista Motel in North Hollywood.
Bungalow 1.
What do you know about this?
Uh--
Who is it?
( line clicks dead )
Hello?
Hello?
She'll probably leave right away.
You'd better start out.
Okay.
Fifteen thousand?
( ringing )
Hello?
JANICE:
Mrs. Walters.
Your husband is in town, at the Valley Vista Motel.
Bungalow 1.
( gasps ) What's that?
Howard?
He wants to see you.
Howard?
Is Howard--?
( line clicks dead )
( pushing cradle )
Hello?
He--
( doorbell rings )
( exhales )
( doorbell rings )
Good evening.
Mrs. Walters?
What is it?
Who are you?
This is Miss Street.
My name is Mason.
Wait a minute.
What do you want?
I'm an attorney.
Now, if it's more convenient for you to talk at another time-- Why, yes, it would be.
I represent a member of the Taylor family.
I just wanted to find out if you'd heard from your husband recently.
Why, no.
Not since the plane crash.
Must have been a relief to you to discover that...
Andrew Taylor had been impersonating your husband?
Impersonating Howard?
Yes, it was a relief.
Of course I-
- I feel sorry for Andy.
Really, Mr. Mason, I apologize for being rude--
Not at all.
Haven't you been worried, not hearing from your husband?
Oh, yes.
Yes, terribly worried.
And don't you think it odd that none of the stolen money was found in the wreckage?
Are you implying my husband had something to do with the stolen money, Mr. Mason?
If you haven't heard from him.
He frequently goes on long trips.
Without keeping in touch?
Sometimes.
Now, look here, I don't have to answer your questions.
I beg your pardon.
We're, uh, sorry to have disturbed you.
Come on, Della.
( dramatic theme playing )
( car starts )
She didn't go in.
And the police, Perry.
Uh-huh.
( car approaches )
( car door closes )
Sorry.
You'll have to stand back.
My name is Mason.
Okay, Mason.
I'll see the reporters spell the name right.
What happened?
It'll be in the morning papers.
Hastings?
Uh-
- Oh.
Well, hello, lieutenant.
Well, I was kind of expecting you, Perry.
Then you know more than I do.
I wasn't expecting to be here.
Murder?
Uh-huh.
Who is it?
The one we were looking for:
Walters.
When did it happen?
Well, we can't be sure.
About an hour ago, the manager here thought he heard a backfire.
And it could've been then.
Uh, we'll have the whole story in a few minutes.
Oh?
Yes, we have the killer.
She came back for her gun, we caught her.
Who's "her"?
Andrew Taylor's wife:
Carol Taylor.
( dramatic theme playing )
And that's my story, ma'am.
I was with Mr. Walters all the time he was up in the mountains... so I feel like I know you personal-like.
What do you know about me personal-like?
Oh, this and that.
You weren't his wife, but he was in love with you.
Crazy about you.
I can't believe Howard talked to you like that.
Well, he didn't.
Not directly.
But when we first met up, he was out of his head.
Delirious.
Of course, I didn't connect up anything he was saying till he... mentioned $130,000.
What about $130,000?
Seems like you're holdin' it for him.
Am I?
'Course, now you can get to keep it.
Can I?
Mr. Walters ain't in no condition to ask for his share.
Isn't he?
No.
Why not?
'Cause he's dead, Miss Janice.
You know that.
And that nice-lookin', apple-cheeked young feller in there knows it too.
I mean the one you was with this evening at the Valley Vista Motel... a little before the cops came.
Roger.
What do you want?
Well, I'm a stranger in town.
I heard so much about Los Angeles from Howard,
I had to see it for myself.
I ain't lying' when I tell you it's left me flat busted.
That means you want money?
That's right.
Well, why do you think we should give you money?
If you don't know why, there's no use my telling you.
I'm in the wrong place.
All right.
You're in the wrong place.
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, just a second.
Where you going?
To the right place, I reckon.
Where?
Police station.
Oh, what makes you think we were at the motel tonight?
Saw you, that's why.
Oh, that means you were there.
That's right.
So you could have killed Howard Walters.
Sure.
I guess I could have.
I didn't though.
How much money do you want?
Would $500 be too much?
Well, Walters knew the combination of the safe.
The police figure he gave you the combination just before he left on his trip.
That you stole the money.
Walters picked up Andy by plane in Fresno, and then with Andy already dead, he deliberately crashed the plane.
It just doesn't make sense.
They believe that when Walters returned... you met him at the motel and killed him, in order to keep the $130,000 for yourself.
It isn't true.
I don't have anybody's money!
Why would they say I stole that money if I--
They found $15,000 in your home.
In my home?
But I didn't steal any money.
Mr. Mason, I-- I'd never conspire to steal or-- Or murder.
What were you doing in that bungalow?
I--
I just went to talk to Mr. Walters.
I found him dead.
How did you know where he was?
I received a telephone call.
From whom?
( exhales )
Man's voice?
Woman's?
A-
- A woman's.
I-I'm not sure.
It was muffled-like, fuzzy.
What did the voice say?
It said if I wanted evidence to prove that Andy didn't steal his father's money, I--
I should go to the Valley Vista Motel,
Bungalow 1.
If Walters was dead, how did you get in?
The door was open.
How many times were you in Walters' bungalow tonight?
Once.
Just once!
( sobbing )
Had you figured out that Walters killed Andy?
Mr. Mason... if you had told me the police believe that I shot Mr. Walters because he killed Andy,
I'd say it makes sense, even if it isn't true.
Yes, Mr. Mason, I figured it out.
And if you don't want to represent me, I--
Mrs. Taylor.
It'll be a privilege to represent you.
( dramatic theme playing )
( dramatic theme playing )
And, uh, death was instantaneous.
The bullet passing through the heart and lodging in the spine.
And I show you now this bullet and ask you if you can identify it.
Yes, sir.
It has my mark.
That is the lethal bullet.
Thank you, doctor.
Your witness.
( bullet clatters on table )
Uh, doctor, did you perform an autopsy on the decedent?
Yes, sir.
Did you find evidence of a recently broken leg?
Yes, I did.
Thank you, doctor.
That'll be all.
You may stand down, doctor.
MAN:
Well, I got a call from Unit 9-- that's in back of the court
--so I went over and I knocked on the door.
So I was outside when I heard something like a shot.
Well, at that time, I thought it was a car backfiring outside of Bungalow number 1.
And what time was that?
Well, it was about a quarter to 8.
And what did you do then?
Well...not getting any answer to my knock,
I went out toward the street to see what had happened, and that's when I saw this woman coming out from behind the bungalows.
She was running pretty scared.
BURGER:
I see.
Thank you, sir.
Your witness.
( clears throat )
( door opens, closes )
Now, this, uh-- This woman you saw, did you recognize her?
MAN:
No, sir.
And was that the only noise you heard that evening that sounded like a shot or a backfire?
Uh, yes, sir.
Now, excepting the time you went to Unit 9 at a quarter of 8, were you in your office at all times between 7:30 and 9:00?
Oh, yes, sir.
And from your office or from Unit 9, could you have seen anyone who might have called at Bungalow 1?
Well, no, I couldn't swear to who called there.
But I could've heard anything that sounded like a shot plain enough.
MASON:
Thank you.
That'll be all.
ROGER:
My job at Taylor Maid is head bookkeeper.
I take care of expense accounts and vouchers, and the bookkeeping on payrolls, and so on.
BURGER:
I see.
Now, could you tell us, in that capacity, the whereabouts of Mr. Andrew Taylor at 11 a.m.
on the morning of January 26th?
That's the day of the airplane crash.
Yes, sir.
Andy--
Andrew Taylor was in Fresno.
He called the office collect from there.
Did anyone else call the office from Fresno that same morning?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Howard Walters.
May I show you these...paper ribbons and ask if you can... identify them for us?
Yes.
It's a currency package marker, printed to our order at Taylor Maid.
To enclose $5,000 in cash for a bank deposit.
And where do you keep these packages of money?
In the safe in our executive offices.
Until they're deposited.
I see.
Thank you, Mr. Porter.
Your witness.
Uh, Mr. Porter... as I understand it, both Howard Walters and Andrew Taylor were in Fresno Monday morning, January 26th?
That's right.
Uh, thank you.
That'll be all.
JUDGE:
You may stand down, Mr. Porter.
Uh, $130,000 was taken out of the safe sometime near midnight, the evening of Sunday, January 25th.
And who knew the combination to that safe, Mr. Taylor?
Myself.
Andrew.
And Howard Walters.
Now, it's been established that Howard Walters was out of town that night, is that correct?
That's right.
He phoned me at home
Sunday evening from Fresno.
Your witness.
Mr. Taylor... the fact that only three people knew the combination of the safe doesn't rule out one of the three telling a fourth party, does it?
No, sir.
Then Howard Walters could've told a fourth party, could he not?
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, has it not occurred to you that someone could've robbed the safe Sunday evening while Mr. Walters was establishing an alibi for himself in Fresno?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
Uh, just a moment, Mr. Taylor.
One question on a redirect, please.
Uh, Mr. Taylor, you just testified that Howard Walters could've given a fourth party the combination of that safe.
Couldn't that fourth party have been the defendant?
I thought of it, yes.
Uh, that's all, Mr. Taylor.
Thank you.
And now, lieutenant, would you tell this court, please, what happened at approximately 15 minutes before 9:00 on the evening of March 16th.
Well, a call sent me to the Valley Vista Motel,
Bungalow 1.
And what did you find when you got there?
When I got there,
Mrs. Andrew Taylor, the defendant, had been taken into custody.
Did you have a conversation with Mrs. Taylor at that time?
Yes, sir.
I asked the defendant what she was doing there... and she answered by repeating over and over again,
"That's my gun.
That's my gun."
I show you now this .32-caliber gun, and ask if you recognize it.
Yes, sir.
That has my identifying mark on it.
It's the gun found in the murder room, and has been checked out by, uh,
Ballistics as the murder weapon.
Uh, did you also check the registration of this gun?
Yes, sir.
It's registered in the name of Carol Taylor, the defendant.
And when you subsequently searched the defendant's home, what did you find there?
Well, the search of the defendant's home turned up three packages of money, $5,000 in each, and each package wrapped in one of these.
We found them buried under a planter box.
Thank you, lieutenant.
That'll be all.
Your witness.
Lieutenant, who reported the murder?
It was a phone tip.
Anonymous.
We couldn't even identify if it was a man or a woman.
And by the time you reached the motel, a prowl car had arrived?
Yes, sir.
Just in time for our officer to catch the defendant going out the window again.
Again?
Had they caught the defendant going out the window once before?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
It's just a figure of speech.
Just a figure of speech.
Now, lieutenant...
you were aware of the autopsy report on the decedent's broken leg?
Yes.
Then after instituting some research, you must have found out where Mr. Walters spent the seven weeks between the time his plane crashed on January 26th, and his reappearance on March 16th?
Yes, sir.
In the cabin of a prospector by the name of Zachary Davis.
Did you speak with this Zachary Davis?
Heh.
Still looking for him.
I see.
Now, when you examined the body of Andrew Taylor, you found a bullet to be the cause of death.
May I ask if that bullet was fired from the murder weapon introduced in evidence during this hearing?
Yes, sir.
It was.
And as I understand it... what transpired could have gone like this:
Walters met the unsuspecting young Taylor in Fresno, offered him a lift in the company plane, shot the boy with his own gun, caused the plane to crash, while he, Walters, bailed out.
Yes, sir.
It could've happened like that.
Then Walters brought that gun back to Los Angeles, where he himself was killed with it?
Yeah.
Could've been like that.
Thank you, lieutenant.
That'll be all.
I couldn't really identify the voice on the phone... except that it was a woman.
And what did this woman's voice say to you?
She said that Howard was in town.
And then she told me where Howard was staying.
And what time was this?
Time?
No, I don't know.
About 20 after 8.
Thank you, Ms. Walters.
Your witness.
Now, you say this voice on the telephone was unidentifiable, Mrs. Walters?
Yes.
Then it could have been almost anyone?
Almost any woman.
Now, when you drove to the motel and saw the police there, you didn't go in.
You hadn't seen your husband for almost two months, you knew he was there, and still you didn't go in.
You drove away.
Why?
Uh, I was afraid.
Isn't it true, Mrs. Walters, that seeing the police at the motel was no surprise to you?
Isn't it true that you had visited with your husband earlier?
That you drove away because you had either killed him or had knowledge of his death?
No.
No.
No, I wouldn't.
No?
That's all, thank you.
Gentlemen... if you have no objections,
I'll call a somewhat early recess this afternoon.
I have no objections, Your Honor.
No objection, Your Honor.
Very well.
Court is adjourned till 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Perry.
I checked out Della's message on Unit 9.
A Milton Smith moved in the same night Walters did.
Good, Paul.
Let's go.
( dramatic theme playing )
( mysterious theme playing )
Can I help you folks?
May we come in, Mr. Smith?
Or should I say Davis?
Come in.
Why, you're the lawyer fellow, Mason.
I expect you know that Howard Walters spent some time at my cabin in the Sierras.
Is that it?
Is that what you want?
How much did he tell you about the money he'd stolen?
He didn't tell me anything, Mr. Mason.
What about the woman?
His accomplice?
I don't know anything about any woman.
( knocking ) MAN:
Open up.
Police.
Well, surprise.
I didn't expect you here.
I expected you, lieutenant.
Mr. Zachary Davis?
Yes, sir?
You'll have to come with me, Mr. Davis.
The district attorney's office wants you for questioning.
Aren't you forgetting something, lieutenant?
What?
Money.
What money?
I'd guess most of the money stolen from the Taylor Maid offices.
( slow, dramatic theme playing )
Well, the first few days, he was delirious.
He kept talkin' about this woman he was supposed to meet at the cabin.
She was supposed to bring the money with her.
Did he mention the name of this woman?
Yes, sir.
Carol.
Just Carol?
Uh, Carol Taylor.
They planned to kill her husband and make it seem like it was Walters died in the plane.
It isn't true.
Now, why did you follow Howard Walters to Los Angeles, Mr. Davis?
Well, I'm gettin' a little old, Mr. Prosecutor.
I guess I've seen so many others stake a claim and get rich... while mine always petered out.
I guess I figured this was one claim I couldn't lose on.
Mm, go on.
Well, I was keeping tabs on Walters.
And a little before 8 on the night of the murder,
I spotted this woman, her... bringing along a suitcase to Walter's bungalow.
What happened then?
Uh, then I went back to my room.
Well, in a little while, I heard this shot.
Well, it sounded like a shot to me anyway, but--
But I wasn't gonna meddle in anybody's business.
But then I got to thinki" about that suitcase... and Walters, and the woman and all, so I went to Walters' bungalow, and there was no answer.
So I went in.
Well, he was dead all right, and the suitcase was there... so I took it.
Would you please point to the woman that you saw enter Howard Walters' room at the Valley Vista Motel?
Her.
BURGER:
Let the record show that the witness is pointing at the defendant, Carol Taylor.
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
You may cross-examine, Mr. Mason.
( clears throat )
( clears throat )
Mr. Davis... haven't you made a mistake in this story of yours?
Mistake?
Haven't you substituted the name of Carol Taylor for that of Janice Atkins.
ZACK:
I don't know any Janice Atkins.
MASON:
But you paid her a visit yesterday afternoon.
You must be mistaken.
No, I have the report of a private detective.
Well...he must be mistaken.
According to his report... you entered her apartment house empty-handed... you came out 35 minutes later carrying a valise.
No, sir.
The detective further reported that while you were in Miss Atkins' apartment, you were joined by...
Roger Porter.
No, sir.
Weren't you blackmailing them, Mr. Davis?
I told you how I found that money.
It is possible, Mr. Davis, that by perjuring yourself, you are also involving yourself as an accessory after the fact.
Your Honor...
I protest.
Counsel's intimidating this witness.
There seem to be some discrepancies here,
Mr. Prosecutor.
Mr. Mason.
Do you, in fact, have proof that the witness called on this person named Janice Atkins?
Yes, Your Honor.
If counsel has no objection, I'd like Mr. Davis to step down while I call Miss Janice Atkins to the stand.
No objection, Your Honor.
Miss Atkins will come forward.
You may step down, Mr. Davis.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
State your name.
Janice Atkins.
Be seated, please.
Miss Atkins... do you know the previous witness,
Mr. Zachary Davis?
No.
Did he call on you yesterday afternoon at your apartment?
No.
Now, you're under oath... and the allegation has been made that the witness did call on you.
That one Roger Porter joined you.
And that the witness departed with a valise filled with money.
Maybe he saw somebody else in my apartment house.
May I, Your Honor?
All right, counselor.
Now, the witness, Zachary Davis, stated that he got that valise from Howard Walters.
But Howard Walters did not live at your apartment house.
All I know is he didn't get any valise or--
Or any money from me.
MASON:
Now, didn't Mr. Davis blackmail you for that money?
JANICE:
No.
Uh, did you call the defendant on the phone and tell her she could get evidence of the innocence of her husband at the Valley Vista Motel?
No.
And when she went to that motel, did you, or your accomplice, Roger Porter, plant $15,000 of the stolen money in the defendant's home?
No.
Fifteen thousand was found in the defendant's home,
$100,000 was found in the valise.
Leaving an undiscovered 15,000.
I don't know anything about it.
I must warn you, Miss Atkins, that a search warrant will be issued.
That your apartment will be searched before you have an opportunity to return to it and remove any incriminating evidence.
I caution you as I cautioned Mr. Davis.
That by perjuring yourself now, even if you're not guilty of murder, you may be indicted as an accessory after the fact.
Or did you really kill Howard Walters, the man with whom you conspired, to rob and murder?
No, I didn't.
You didn't kill him?
No.
But you did steal $130,000 from the Taylor Maid safe?
Mm, yes, but I didn't conspire to kill Andy Taylor.
I didn't know that was part of Howard's plan.
And you did plant $15,000 in the defendant's home, to make it appear she was guilty?
Yes.
Yes, but I didn't kill Howard.
He did.
Roger did.
( whispers ):
No.
Don't do that to me, Janice.
( people murmuring )
Order!
Order in the court.
( slow, dramatic theme playing )
If Your Honor please, I think we may get to the bottom of this case if I'm allowed to finish my cross-examination of Zachary Davis.
Mr. Davis.
Well, you c-
- Can't blame a fella for trying to keep his skirts clean.
So, okay, it was Janice Atkins and Roger Porter all the time.
What about the defendant, Carol Taylor?
She had nothing to do with it.
Uh, would you explain to this court why you perjured yourself?
Well, l-like I said, just to keep my skirts clean.
How dirty are they?
Well, I, uh...
I admit I tried to move in on all that money.
The, uh, first try for 500, well... that was just to test out if I could make a strike there at all.
I'd say your skirts are dirtier than that, Mr. Davis.
But not as dirty as theirs, though.
They killed Walters, didn't they?
MASON:
No.
ZACK:
Then who did?
His wife?
MASON:
No.
ZACK:
The young man's father?
Old man Taylor himself?
MASON:
No.
You figure me.
It had to be you, Mr. Davis.
How's that?
From the evidence.
The sound of the shot that killed Walters.
You said you heard it in your room.
That's right.
But you weren't in your room.
Sure I was.
When the motel manager knocked on your door, you didn't answer.
At the time he heard the shot.
There's some mistake there.
Yours, Mr. Davis.
You called the manager to your room to keep him away from Bungalow 1.
That was your mistake.
In not getting an answer when he knocked on your door, he put the lie to your alibi.
( sighs )
Well, I--
That's real tricky.
Real complicated and tricky.
Uh, I guess murder's like that.
No, sir.
Murder is usually very simple.
( slow, dramatic theme playing )
It's the getting away with it that's real complicated and tricky.
Mr. Mason, I want to thank you for supporting my daughter-in-law... and for being patient with my obstinate stupidity.
We all need to learn a little tolerance at one time or another.
It's unfortunate that sometimes the learning comes... after a man's death.
Yes.
I haven't had your bill yet, Mr. Mason... so, uh, I've left the amount here blank.
You fill it out any way you want to.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Mason.
That's a-- ( door opens )
That's a great idea.
Uh, why don't you just, uh...
( door closes ) ...fill my check out like that.
Uh, blank.
Just sign it.
( chuckles )
All right, Paul.
( noirish jazz theme playing )
( noirish jazz theme playing )
THE CARMELITES
Father, I cannot lie.
I'm happy.
I might do wrong in telling you this, my lord,
But suddenly, when I saw Miss Blanche in her wedding dress,
I thought of seeing again the lady, her mother, and you at her arm.
Yes, my good Thierry.
Thanks.
I also thought of that.
- Father.
- Yes?
Do you think it is wise to return through Saint Denis?
Yes, it is true.
We'd meet the crowd and couldn't endure it.
And in these times we should be back before dark.
Yes Thierry, avoid going to Saint Denis.
What do you ask for?
- God's mercy and yours.
In the world your name was Marie Genevieve Meunier.
In religion, your name will be Constance of St. Denis, Martyr.
In the world your name was Blanche de la Force.
In religion, your name will be Blanche of the Agony of Christ.
Our help is in the name of the Lord,
Who made heaven and earth.
God be praised!
God be praised!
Welcome, Sister Blanche!
- Thank you!
Do you feel happy, Sister Blanche?
- Very happy, thank you!
Good night, Sister Blanche.
My daughter, the rule orders to close the door.
Mother, I believe I will never be a good Carmelite.
A scary skull for everybody.
They should warn of the presence of this object in the cell of a Carmelite.
God has sent you here, Mother, to hear what I have not had the courage to tell.
There is a fatal weakness in me that made me suffer greatly.
As a child, I couldn't climb stairs without thinking it was going to collapse.
I have always been afraid of life and death.
Poor little thing.
You've dreamed of this house as a little girl dreams in her dark room, of a common room, with its light and its heat.
You know nothing about the loneliness, how a Carmelite must live ..
..or die.
Mother, I thought I was honest a while ago.
I did not mean to lie to my father.
What did you tell him?
- That I was happy.
We do not seek happiness here.
Our Bridegroom is not the smiling Christ who is shown in religious images.
He is the Man of Sorrows of whom speak Holy Scriptures.
My daughter, in the spirit of Carmel there is no room for softness.
But I'm sick, condemned, as stated by our doctor, Mr. Javelinot.
And so, I can be moved.
Great tests await you, my daughter.
It won't matter, if God gives me strength.
What God wants to prove in you it is not your strength but your weakness.
The nights are short in the Carmel.
And, as a good soldier, a Carmelite should know sleep.
Passing one day on horseback in the plain that extends over Assisi, he met a leper who produced such horror in him that he looked away so as not to see and resumed his journey on the other side,
but recalling the resolution that he had taken..
The doctor is waiting for you.
..dismounted and approached the leper and lovingly kissed his wounds.
Thus showing his great love for Christ..
I'm afraid we can no longer do anything.
It took too much of your strength, Mother.
and I cannot work miracles.
But, Doctor, listen..
Yesterday, however, not only I ate the soup without repugnance, but even with pleasure.
Isn't it so, Mother Marie of the Incarnation?
What your Reverence says is true.
I feel much better than in my last crisis.
When the storm breaks ..
I'm sure I'll rest.
I meant only that we'd better discontinue the medication and let nature take its course, with no more struggling against the disease.
Try to relax and not to move.
May God preserve you, my Mother!
To Him I give my healing or dying
According to His will.
I'm sorry I thought aloud in front of the Reverend Mother, Prioress.
Do not regret anything.
If you have attended more houses like this, you'll know that there are two kinds of religious able to die peacefully:
the very holy and mediocre.
It is very painful to have to show myself like this, cared for like a drowned just out of the water.
If it were not for my legs, numb and lifeless,
I'd not believe to be in danger.
Mother Marie.
How many days of life has Mr. Javelinot calculated?
Excuse me, your Reverence, but he thinks that it is not even a matter of days.
My God, I've reached the end.
Go find Blanche.
- Bring her, Sister St. Augustine.
It was my understanding, Mother, that your anxiety had subsided tonight.
It was a drowsiness of the soul.
So I did not feel like I was dying.
Now, nothing distracts me from death.
I'm alone, Mother, all alone, without any consolation.
I'm alone..
and I am scared.
Get up daughter, and don't look at me like that.
There is nothing unusual before your eyes.
Do not leave me, Mother.
My daughter..
Why did you choose to be called
Blanche of the Agony of Christ?
I do not know, Mother.
It was like an impulse.
Of all the moments of the life of Our Lord,
I wish I had been with him just when he was alone and abandoned in Gethsemane.
Of all my daughters, you're the last one who has arrived.
The most beloved of my heart.
The more helpless and threatened.
To avert this threat, I would have given my poor life.
Now, I can not give more than my death.
A poor death!
Mother Marie of the Incarnation!
- Yes, Reverend Mother?
I was the one who introduced into this house..
Sister Blanche of the Agony of Christ.
I'm responsible for her.
I must delegate this responsibility before someone else takes my office.
Mother Marie!
In the name of Holy Obedience..
I entrust to you Sister Blanche of the Agony of Christ..
here present.
You will answer me for her before God.
Yes, Mother.
Again these detestable beans!
They say that speculators rationed the flour, and that they won't have bread in Paris
Oh, finally the iron is here!
They've fixed it already.
Look how they have strengthened the handle.
We shan't hear Sr. Jeanne of the Divine Infancy scream while blowing her fingers,"How can one iron with such a piece of junk!"
Hilarious.
I bite my tongue to keep from laughing.
When she says..
- Constance!
Are not you ashamed to talk like that when our Mother is dying?
My God, sister.
In the Carmel, death is a ceremony like any other.
The last on earth before the great processions of Paradise.
Have you not ever had fear of death?
- Life has always seemed so much fun!
Aren't you afraid God may get tired one day of so much good humor and say to you as to St. Angela of Foligno:
"Love is not always joy?"
Sister Blanche, I cannot help believing that you wanted to hurt me on purpose.
No, you're wrong.
I did it because of envy.
You envy me?
How strange.
You envy me when I deserve to be flogged to speak so lightly of the death of our Rev. Mother.
Sister Blanche:
Let us offer our two poor lives for that of her Reverence.
But what I have to do in this comedy?
Leave that silly board and answer me!
Sister Blanche, now you're upset with me.
How can you believe that our lives can save another's life?
You're as proud as hell!
That's horrible!
Horrible!
Stop, stop!
Let's stop ringing the bells!
There's too much haste, I have not died yet.
Calm down, Mother, they're not ringing any bell.
It's my poor ears that are playing outbursts.
Have you summoned the community?
The ceremony, to which your Reverence is referring, can wait.
Yes, until I am good for nothing.
But look, look!
How can I show this face to my daughters?
- But, Mother, do not worry about us.
Do not worry about anything other than God.
Who am I, miserable me, to care for him?
Let Him worry about me!
- Your Reverence is delirious.
Watch out for the horses!
Close all doors, quick!
Oh, too late!
Peace, Mother!
- What do you mean?
Peace, peace!
Are you blind?
Don't you see the war and blood everywhere?
Mother Marie!
Mother Marie!
- Yes, Mother?
I've just seen our chapel empty and desecrated.
The altar split in two..
straw and blood on the tiles.
Oh, God is abandoning us!
God is repudiating us!
I beg you say nothing that might..
- Say nothing, say nothing!
Why nothing?
Sr. Elisabeth, close the window!
What matters what I say!
Anguish..
is stuck to my skin as a mask of wax.
If I could tear it with my fingernails!
Tell the sisters that today they will not see the Rev. Mother.
At six recreation, as usual.
No, Mother Marie of the Incarnation:
I order you..
Sr. Elisabeth, you are not going to faint like a little girl?
Get on your knees and pray.
There's nothing else we can do.
Sr. Blanche!
Sr. Blanche, come!
Take off the apron.
Sisters, our Mother has appeared before God.
Sr. Catherine, intone the Salve Regina..
I'd never have thought that an election in Carmel would take so long.
They must be discussing as much as in the National Assembly.
It's a difficult election.
Things are becoming worse for religion.
I bet on Mother Marie of the Incarnation,
I've prayed for her election.
You always think that God will decide according to your tastes.
- And why not?
I also hope they elect Mother Marie, as she is the most worthy of all.
I proclaim elected as prioress of the Carmel,
Mother Therese of St. Augustine.
Our help is in the Name of the Lord.
Who created heaven and earth.
God be praised.
- May He be praised.
Sr. Lucie!
- Whom have they elected?
Mother Therese of St. Augustine.
- God be praised!
Tell her Reverence the Commissioner is here and he is getting impatient.
Sister Lucie, here are the letters for the Commissioner.
Tell him that the Reverend Mother is waiting in the parlor.
Mr. Commissioner, I apologize if I made you wait, but an election is always more complicated and longer than expected.
And since when, ma'am, you vote in convents?
Since ever, I imagine, or otherwise, for centuries;
this shows that we are not as reactionary as they say.
My name is Mother Therese of St. Augustine.
And is it you whom they elected prioress?
Yes, in fact, not what I expected.
Are you a foreigner?
In our homes there is no foreigner.
We are all sisters.
Oh, sure.
Equality, fraternity and freedom.
We're here freely.
I've sent you the list not only of the goods of the community, but also of the endowments of the religious.
Do you want to proceed with any verification?
No, ma'am, your word and signature are enough.
But it is my duty to warn you that you have only the usufruct of these assets, which now belong to the nation.
Citizen, bring these documents to the municipality.
Madam.
It seems, in France and even in this city the bloodthirsty and rioters are the majority.
I am not such.
So, facilitate my work.
Rightly or wrongly, people think that the monasteries are home of profiteers and traitors.
As for me, I have the duty to follow the orders from Paris.
In this situation, the slightest imprudence on your part could be fatal.
Your recommendations are consistent with my main concern.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Father, I am Chevalier de la Force.
Help me to hide.
Come in, quickly.
Here they will not find you.
They have been following me for a mile.
- You can sleep here.
Thanks, but I am in a great hurry.
They expect me in Vermont before dawn.
I must reach the army of the princes and would like to see my sister immediately.
I am only the chaplain.
We'll have to ask the Mother Prioress.
Luckily, the night office is not over.
Come with me.
Mr. Chevalier de La Force wants to see his sister.
He's leaving France.
He cannot wait until morning.
But they'll accuse us of hosting fugitives.
Only you, Mother, can decide.
But you must decide quickly.
Under the rule, I have no right to deny a religious to see her brother, even less if she might not see him again.
Take him to the parlor.
Accompany Sr. Blanche to the parlor.
What fright you gave me.
What does this visit in the middle of the night mean?
How is our Father?
He entrusted me with a message for you.
He says that here you're not safe.
Maybe you're right, but I feel safe.
And that's enough for me.
Blanche, we just have a few minutes.
Only from abroad one can defend the King.
That is why I'm leaving.
Do not get your hopes up.
The revolution will not spare anything that it has decided to destroy.
And you advise me to flee from danger, while you are going to meet it?
Blanche, I beg you, do not act like a child.
The habit you wear is not a defense, on the contrary.
Mr. Chevalier.
This habit is a uniform on a battlefield.
And the Carmel is a fortress that prepares itself to support an assault.
But you, my daughter, as long as you have not pronounced your vows are free to go.
- Please, Mother, I'm staying.
I want you to think of myself as a comrade in arms.
We will both fight, each in his way.
And mine has risks and dangers, like yours.
So, farewell little sister.
Our father will be very proud of you.
Now we're all bound to the same destiny.
Who knows?
I've been proud, I will be punished.
Citizen, no passage.
What's happening?
- Warn the Prioress immediately.
The whole community shall meet in the chapel.
Mother Mary, we must expect an inspection.
You stay at the cloister door.
And when those men come to ask to enter, demand, above all to see the inspection order.
Do not oppose any resistance, but do not separate from them.
Thanks be to God, Mr. de La Force is far away.
Rev. Mother, Sr. Blanche is not there.
Go see in her cell.
If she's tired, tell her I give her permission to rest.
Put the veil.
Christ, have mercy on us.
- Christ, have mercy on us
Lord, have mercy on us.
- Lord, have mercy on us.
God, the Father of heaven!
- Have mercy on us!
God, the Son, the Redeemer of the world!
- Have mercy on us!
God, the Holy Spirit!
- Have mercy on us!
Holy Mary!
- Pray for us!
Holy Mother of God!
- Pray for us!
Saint Michael!
- Pray for us!
Saint Gabriel!
- Pray for us!
Saint Stephen!
- Pray for us!
Saint Lawrence!
- Pray for us!
Saint Vincent!
- Pray for us!
Saint Sylvester!
- Pray for us!
Saint Gregory!
- Pray for us!
Saint Ambrose!
- Pray for us!
Who is she?
Could we end once with this masquerade?
Take off the veil, Sr. Constance.
Citizen..
How long have you been locked in this house?
I'm very happy to be in here, as if I were at home.
I don't feel locked up at all, Mr. Commissioner.
And why does one accept to live behind bars?
To know God, love Him, and serve Him, and thus merit eternal happiness, Mr. Commissioner.
Ah, I see you know the lesson by heart.
We know it with certainty.
Last night they had concealed a suspect.
And he must show up somewhere.
Come, citizen, do not be afraid.
I'm here only to provide the protection of the law.
Citizen!
I order you to tell me how long ago this girl has been held here.
I think you should ask herself.
She seems to have lost the use of the word.
You don't think it was you who scared her?
This girl will come to explain herself in front of the municipality.
A registration permit does not give you rights over people.
This girl will leave from here only by her own will.
Sr. Blanche.
- I forbid you to continue!
Here I represent the Reverend Prioress and I will not take orders from you.
Citizen, remind her that we have a machine to cut the breath..
Shut up.
Young Citizen, say just a word..
and we'll immediately free you from those who have not even feared to abuse the name of "Mother".
Certainly to submit is better.
You should not be afraid.
Since you are now under the protection of the law.
First of all, she is under mine.
And I won't let you abuse the terror of a child.
You should also know, Commissioner, that for the poorest daughters of the Carmel honor is stronger than fear.
I'll have to give account to the municipality.
It is to your conscience that you should give account first.
As long as there are beings like you, there'll be no respite for the patriots.
This house is a Bastille.
And we'll destroy it, like the other.
You must also destroy us, to the last, because where there is a daughter of St. Therese, there is a Carmel.
Follow me, citizen.
What a fool I am!
That conversation was to make us forget our mission.
I know where the fugitive is hiding.
- Where, citizen Commissioner?
All the nuns here wear black veils.
And I bet that the fugitive is there in the middle, he also with his veil, reciting the Our Father.
From sudden and unprovided death!
-Deliver us, O Lord.
From the snares of the devil!
- Deliver us, O Lord.
From anger, hatred..
In the name of law:
I order you to immediately remove your veils and look at me with your face uncovered.
I told you that you must remove those veils.
My daughters, take off your veils.
Take off your veil, Sr. Jeanne.
My daughters, wait in the cloister.
I ask you to vote to decide whether we should allow them to pronounce the vows, or we should return them to the world.
The new French laws formally ban monastic vows.
If two novices pronounced them, it would be a challenge.
I do not intend to challenge anyone.
I've done everything possible to avoid colliding with the Commissioner, but I can not go so far as to ask permission to observe the rule.
The ceremony will be secret, behind closed doors.
For Sr. Constance, no problem.
For Sr. Blanche, it is not so simple.
- I agree.
Sr. Blanche took refuge here for the rule to protect her and keep her, when it is we who must protect the rule.
Excuse me, Reverend Mother.
I would plead with the Council in favor of Sr. Blanche of the Agony of Christ.
I know the risks of her character, but I feel it would break a promise to the dead if we rejected her and I could not watch over her.
Let's vote.
Three votes against.
Someone go find Sr. Blanche of the Agony of Christ.
I'm going, Mother.
Sister Blanche!
My daughter,
Neither you nor we hope more than you may be freed here from your mortal anguish.
The Council has decided to return you to the protection of your father.
No doubt that in better times or later, who knows..
Answer me honestly.
Do you think I will hurt you by returning you to the world?
Yes, you'll hurt me.
Not even I expect to overcome my weakness.
No, I don't expect it any more.
But this house is the only place in the world where I can offer it to our Lord, as a patient offers his wounds.
I believe, Mother, that maybe God wanted me a coward as He wanted the others good or stupid.
All right, so be it.
Sister Blanche of the Agony of Christ, remain a Carmelite.
I will never leave you.
Do you understand me?
Never.
Sacrifice to God the glory of the world.
Is it by your own will and by choice that you pronounce these solemn vows?
- Yes.
Do you intend to persevere until death?
- Yes.
And just for the love of our Lord?
Yes, by the grace of God and the prayers of my sisters.
May God, who has guided you to us, lead you until the the end.
Sacrifice to God the glory of the world.
I am not leaving you, but I am obliged to hide.
I refused to swear allegiance to the Constitution.
I'm an outcast.
Now, for you, I'm out of the law.
But if a fish can not live out of water, a Christian lives very well outside the law.
We will manage the same, with some precautions.
André will be our contact.
In the affairs of this world, when you lose all hope of reconciliation, the last resort is strength.
In God's affairs, the last resort is the sacrifice of the consecrated souls.
Sister, pray for me.
- Sister, pray for me.
Sister, pray for me.
- Sister, pray for me.
Sister, pray for me.
Mother, pray for me.
Concern does not make you lose your appetite, Sr. Constance.
It is the fourth apple that I see you eat.
Really, at this rate the basket will not be filled.
Why do we need so many provisions?
Maybe we die before these apples rot.
It is not fixed that we die.
I have no hurry to die, Sr. Constance.
- Ah, neither do I.
But if we let the Lord decide about our lives, what's the use of worrying about what to eat?
We may never find another opportunity to be gluttonous.
Yours is a curious way of preparing for martyrdom.
On the contrary, it's appropriate.
Before facing the lions in the arena, to be devoured,
I want at least to suppress my hunger.
Well, Sr. Constance, the lions will surely be very grateful.
Moreover, their food will be more nutritious.
Soldiers!
Come and see you too, Sr. Anne of Jesus.
What are they singing?
It must be a new song, I've never heard it.
It's a terrible song.
- Yes, but it is magnificent.
Down from the ladder immediately.
You have violated claustration.
- Forgive us, Mother.
What was the matter with you?
I had a crazy idea, Mother:
I have a brother in the national army, and I thought he was marching with them, and that I could see him.
And you, Sr. Constance?
Oh Mother, I could not resist.
I love parades.
I'm glad of your visit, Commissioner, so I can protest directly to you.
Protest, madam, and why?
Because we have been deprived of our Chaplain.
It's absurd to think that a peaceful man like him could be considered dangerous
and be made an outlaw.
Madam, I'm afraid you have not understood your own situation and the danger you are facing.
What harm do we do?
It is not the harm you do, but that which is attributed to you.
Have not you heard that the Prussians are marching on Verdun?
And maybe they'll be here in three days, and in five in Paris.
Across France volunteers are enrolled.
The people feel betrayed.
And they are suspicious everywhere.
On Sunday, in Paris, there was a massacre in the prison.
Oh God!
Are you sure?
Yes, I am.
There is here among you, a young woman..
whose name is Sr. Anne of Jesus.
Yes.
What do you want from her?
She had a brother in the army of the Rhine, he was killed in battle.
They found a letter to his sister.
So I heard.
At last you'll be convinced, Mr. Commissioner, that we are good patriots.
We want peace and the protection of the law.
Ah, madam, if it were only that.
Why?
What else is there?
When things go wrong in the country, someone is to blame.
So, why not you?
Dear daughters, death, truncating all the affections, is always cruel.
And violent death, especially if the cause is a human being, is even more cruel.
Our country is unhinged by the invasion and the civil war.
Our relatives are divided into different fields.
Some have emigrated brothers and cousins who fight for the Princes.
others have relatives in the national armies.
Men are fighting.
Let us condemn neither one nor the other.
We are not judges, but only pleaders.
May the civil war never enter into our hearts.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.
Open up, open up immediately!
I thought I wouldn't escape!
- What happened?
There's a crowd in the church square, and they are furious.
The baker of Meaux has been reported.
Mother Marie, gather them all in the chapel.
Do not be afraid, you will remain here with us.
And the Chaplain?
- They didn't find him.
He was not in the hideout when they searched, but they arrested the baker.
And when they saw me arrive for the bread, they grew furious.
If you allow me, I will go to the door to talk to these people.
No, my daughter, one doesn't talk to an out-of-control crowd.
Courage, my daughters!
It's not the first time that they invade and pillage churches and monasteries.
It often happens during wars.
Silence!
Citizens!
Citizens!
The French army has obtained a great victory at Valmy.
And in Paris, the Republic has been proclaimed!
It is more than twenty years since you have set foot outside this house.
And now you go to Paris.
Are you even sure you can come back?
We are concerned for the life of your Reverence.
It is necessary that somebody should go to get recognition.
I feel that the circle is closing every day more about us.
In a big city a group of seventeen women may be overlooked.
Why not take the risk of our vocation to the end?
Why don't we stay all in this house, with our habit..
observing the holy rule, and die, if necessary, as Carmelites.
Mother Marie, what I want is to protect the Carmel.
What would all of us perishing profit, if the Carmel perish with us?
I'll say farewell to my daughters.
Careful, Sr. Constance, or you will burn St. Denise.
Is not it enough that they cut his head?
It would be a shame.
He looks so cute with his head in his hands.
It's outrageous.
Why portray our great St. Teresa with a sword in her heart?
The founder of Carmel died quietly in her bed, I know.
Sr. Blanche, why are you shocked?
It is a symbol.
St. Teresa died of love for God, so an angel grabs the sword.
I do not think God would send his angels..
to kill those who love Him.
But if God sent His Son to the terrible sacrifice of the cross.
And from that first Good Friday there is no greater honor for a Christian than to be sent to the gallows like Christ.
You said it well, Mother.
"It's an honor."
And as for us, Carmelites, we shouldn't run after honors in any case.
When a great king, before the whole court, makes a sign to the maid to sit together to him, on his throne of glory, it is preferable that she should believe neither her eyes nor her ears,
and continue cleaning the furniture.
In my absence, to Mother Marie, who has my confidence,
I delegate my authority.
Obey her as myself.
Mother, come back soon to us.
I hope with all my heart.
God help you, my daughter.
Who is it
- I'm André.
The Chaplain has found another hiding place.
He sent me to tell you that he'll celebrate the office of Good Friday tomorrow at midnight in Albetier's barn.
- Thanks, dear.
All precautions have been taken.
We expect to lead you in groups of two or three.
Thank you.
- Good night, Mother.
See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
Friend, whereto art thou come?
Dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss, your Teacher and your Lord?
Then they rushed impetuously upon Him
And the soldiers, full of rage and unbridled fury, those Barbarians, seeing Him in their power, unleashed all their fury upon Him.
It's funny, we have come together to the Carmel.
I chose the name of a martyr, but yours is the most beautiful.
It's the very name of the martyrdom of our Lord.
Today it's like His feast day, I say.
Sr. Blanche, we will not part any more.
Sr. Constance,
I think it's easier to talk here in the dark.
I too would like not to part with you.
But I am afraid.
And I am ashamed to be afraid.
But afraid of what, sister?
Afraid of death, of what is after death.
One day you told me, fear is an illusion of the devil of which God can free us.
Sometimes I think..
that He does not want to free me.
But how can you think that God does not love you?
Even your name, and all that you are must remind God of the terrible moment..
when His own Son felt abandoned.
Come.
Last night, you attended a secret meeting..
under the direction of a recusant priest, pursued by the law.
In the Albetier barn, to be exact.
Answer: yes or no.
- Yes.
And I hold myself responsible for that meeting,
It's I who organized it.
And my sisters did nothing but obey.
That's enough.
All disobeyed the law.
All exposed themselves to suffer its rigor.
We went to venerate the Cross on which our Master suffered His martyrdom.
So much the better if we suffer or even die for that.
In times like these to die is nothing.
To live is nothing.
Is this what you mean?
In fact, only death counts, when life is devalued by fear even to the ridiculous and is worth less than your paper money.
These words may cost you dearly.
I do not think that your comrades approve your insolence.
What's he saying?
I want to know..
if you all agree in disobeying the law..
and insulting a representative of the people.
You should know that nothing can separate us from Mother Marie.
It is to her that we must obey.
We'll see.
First:
You have 24 hours to gather your things and to procure yourselves clothes, other than these ridiculous rags.
Second:
Tomorrow morning you'll be evicted from this site.
This house will be occupied by soldiers.
Third:
From now on, all community life is prohibited to you, and any contact with recusant priests.
And you are forbidden to live more than two or three in the same house.
You will all present yourselves to the municipality to give your names and your new addresses.
And if this is not enough, the strict application of the law will surely be able to end your obstinacy and fanaticism
The regime aims to suppress religion and disperse the monasteries.
I think that the entire community should respond by solemnly pronouncing the vow of martyrdom.
So that France may continue to be Christian, the daughters of Carmel offer their own blood.
What do you think, sisters?
The disadvantage of these extraordinary vows is that they can divide the spirits, and oppose conscience.
And just as we want to affirm the unity of our community.
The opposition of only one of you would make me give up my idea.
Why do not we decide with a secret ballot?
Sr. Anne de Jesus.
Sure there will be a vote against.
There's a black ball.
Forget the vow of martyrdom.
I did it.
Here is my white ball.
But now I agree with all the others, and desire..
I also want to pronounce this vow, I beg you, in the name of the Lord.
It's certainly a sign from God that we all agree.
I, Constance of St. Denis, make the vow of martyrdom.
I solemnly promise to God to imitate His Son in His holy Passion, without defending myself nor fleeing, offering also my blood if necessary.
For the honor of the Carmel, the exaltation of the Church, and the salvation of the world.
I, Blanche of the Agony of Christ, make the vow of martyrdom.
I solemnly promise to God to imitate His Son in His holy Passion, without defending myself nor fleeing, offering also my blood if necessary.
For the honor of the Carmel, the exaltation of the Church, and the salvation of the world.
Here's the list of houses and directions.
You shall divide yourself the sisters in groups.
Tomorrow morning, a cart will come to help you carry the essentials.
You will also give them some civilian clothes.
Sister Blanche.
After the vow we've pronounced,
God will keep us together forever.
I know..
- What do you know?
I know that soon we shall die.
- Do not touch me!
Sister Blanche, what's the matter?
- Do not touch me!
I lied to God.
I did not expect to see you again, at least in this world.
I can not give you any good news.
Sr. Blanche is not here.
Go, I'll catch up with you in a moment, at the municipality.
You'll inform the municipality of the new local distribution.
Are they all?
Citizen Lidoine is missing.
Citizen Lidoine is missing.
Mother Prioress will be here in a moment.
And citizen La Force.
Citizen La Force.
Is she not that girl whom they called
Sr. Blanche of the Agony of Christ?
Why the hell is she not here with you?
Where did she go?
You, who speak so well, answer, citizen!
You do not want to answer.
So it is I who will give them the news.
One of my patrols found this girl late at night, wandering alone through the fields, shaking for cold and fear.
What have you done to her?
Young citizen, you are free now.
Do you want to join those whom you call your sisters or return to Paris to you father?
Here's money and a pass.
Citizen Montreler.
Find more decent clothes for the young citizen.
Mother Therese of St. Augustine Prioress of the Carmel.
Citizen Commissioner, everything is in order.
Citizens, you may leave.
What happened?
The Commissioner gave her the means to go to her father in Paris.
Her father was arrested eight days ago and is in prison.
What should we do, she has only ourselves in the world?
In no way we'll abandon her.
Open, it's me, Thierry.
Thierry!
- Calm down, Miss.
We need you to come with us right away.
With this man?
- Yes, it's urgent.
Yesterday nobody was spared.
You must do what he says.
Citizen, Thierry's right, Let's hurry.
He who was the Marquis de La Force.
My friend.
He who was the Marquis de La Force.
- Yes, yes, I'm coming.
Citizens Judges, the young and curious girl with me is the daughter of the accused.
The Republic snatched her from the hands of the priests who had taken her away from her father to steep her into the depths of fanaticism.
This citizen has given up superstition forever, and has sworn eternal hatred for the aristocrats and tyrants.
She proclaims her dedication to the nation and the Republic.
She has come here to thank her protectors and liberators.
Blanche, has the man who accompanies you, spoken in your name?
Is it true what he says?
No, Dad.
He lied.
Blanche!
Blanche de La Force!
The Reverend Mother sent me to look upon you, upon learning that your father is in prison.
He's in prison no more.
- Is your father free?
He is dead.
He's been guillotined.
My poor daughter, you can not stay here alone.
Come with us.
You mean that with you I'll be safer?
You will run less risk than here.
No, I do not believe it.
Who will want to come to get me here?
I hurt nobody, and I want nobody to hurt me.
Leave me in peace.
You scared me.
Go!
Sister Blanche of the Agony of Christ.
Yes, Mother?
What should I tell our Prioress?
That I do not forget her.
Sr. Blanche, listen to me well.
I'll give you an address.
Remember that.
Miss Rose Ducor, Theater of the Palais Royal.
She has been informed.
You'll be safe with her.
I'll wait for you there.
I won't go.
I don't want to go.
You shall go.
I know you'll be back with us, sister.
I have to see Miss Rose Ducor, immediately.
Wait for her there, she won't be long.
Even here, poor Baptiste.
You're not ashamed to make a parody of a heinous death.
Let's hurry to laugh, that there will be time to mourn.
Oh, Baptiste, when you will stop taking everything so lightly?
Someone is looking for you.
She is waiting back there.
Rose, what are you doing?
- Quick, Rose, we are already late.
Oh, we have all the time!
I want to see how it ends.
Miss, I'm Blanche de La Force.
- Yes.
When I enter the theater follow me into the dressing room.
You come to compete with me before my theater, and yet, you expect that I pay you?
Yes, Miss Ducor pays with Golden Louis.
Stand here and do not let anyone in, not even the maid, for at least ten minutes.
Citizen, you can not enter.
I must see Mother Marie of the Incarnation.
- She's there.
Mother Marie.
Mother..
They have arrested all our sisters and have taken them to Paris to try them.
Sr. Blanche, we must reach them immediately.
O Mother, if there is any way to save them..
I think that now I would have the courage to risk everything.
This is not to save them, but to fulfill the vow of martyrdom we pronounced freely.
And we will let them die without doing anything for them?
What matters is not to let them die without us.
And what need have they of us to die?
To die.
To die.
You only have that word in your mouth.
But, is it not enough for you the horror of the blood already shed?
Only crime is horrible, my daughter.
But I do not want them to die.
And I do not want to die!
What's happening, Sr. Constance?
I slept under the window and it gave me wryneck.
Oh, my poor neck is..
- No, Sr. Constance!
Excuse me, sister, it didn't occur to me..
- Come on, be quiet, Sr. Constance.
Well, my daughters, our first night in jail has passed.
It was the most difficult, but, as you see, we passed it alike.
We are used to bars.
None can take away a freedom to which we voluntarily renounced a long time ago.
Anyway, in court, to all questions answer:
I did but obey my superiors.
It is a formal order.
I try to answer for you on earth as I would do it before God.
With your Reverence we will never be afraid of anything.
Be calm, do everything possible for your lives and your souls.
Citizen, do you have anything to say?
We are the servants of God.
- The Republic does not need servants.
I am the keeper of the soul of the country, but you, who do not recognize the authority of the laws, have also attempted to attack the city.
- We are also citizens of another city.
That's enough!
You should be grateful that you have found in this country, which you betray, a court that heard and judged you.
This afternoon a grave awaits you.
For having formed counterrevolutionary caucuses;
for having had, again and again, fanatical correspondence, and hosted recusant priests and emigrants, preserved liberticide writings.
are sentenced to death.
Dated on Messidor 28, the second year of the Republic.
What does that gentleman say?
That we are condemned to death.
All?
- Yes, all.
Including Mother Marie of the Incarnation, who is not here.
Judgment to be executed immediately.
May God receive us in His bosom.
Who knows if He will recognize you as His own.
We have that confidence.
Because we have not offended Him.
May He forgive us our sins as we forgive you, son.
Citizen President, I ask that you adjourn the court.
The court is adjourned.
My daughters, now we are at the end,
now it is only about dying.
God calls us to the throne of His glory.
It's time to fulfill the vow of martyrdom you have generously made and that God has accepted today.
As for me, who didn't pronounce it, He has given me a part.
Let's thank Him for not having allowed the mother to be separated from the daughters at the time of death.
I humbly share this great gift on behalf of our sisters Marie of the Incarnation and Blanche of the Agony of Christ..
I exploit their vow, though unworthy.
My daughters, once again, for the last time,
I solemnly subject you to obedience.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee..
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee..
Blessed art thou among women..
She who was Sr. Gabrielle.
She who was Sr. Saint Louis.
She who was Sr. Jeanne of the Divine infancy.
She who was Sr. Jeanne of the Divine infancy.
She who was Sr. Lucie.
I knew you would come.
You are crazy.
Don't go any closer.
I don't want them to die without me.
- How does what you want matter?
God chooses and calls whom he wants.
I've dragged my sisters to death.
If they die without me, I will be dishonored.
Shut up!
Who do you think you are?
It is not for you that your sisters dies but for God.
What do I have in this world?
The Carmel.
You will continue it, alone.
How hard is God!
Come with me and repeat what I say.
Our Father who art in heaven..
- Our Father who art in heaven..
Hallowed be thy name..
- Hallowed be thy name..
Thy kingdom come..
- Thy kingdom come..
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven..
Thy will be done..
Thy will be done..
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven..
She who was Sr. Anne of Jesus.
She who was Sr. Constance.
She who was Mother Marie of the Incarnation.
She who was Prioress of the Carmel of Compiègne.
As usual, here we go again.
This is no life.
My ruin.
My ruin!
Scoundrels!
Scoundrels!
Scoundrels!
What's happening here?
- The revolution sir, revolution.
Haven't you heard?
- So much fuss about that?
There's a revolution here every two years, I can't understand it can still impress anyone.
Well, I better pay.
We're even.
We've had enough of president Meza's term.
We are tired of citizens being deprived of carrying arms.
General Vegas has put himself at the head of an army... and every real man should immediately join ranks with these brave ones.
All men that is, and courageous women as well.
Don't wait any longer.
Right now you must take up arms.
We want our freedom.
Out with Meza!
Your delay could cause a great loss for your brothers, those braves fighting Meza from the beginning.
Haven't you heard?
We need strong men like you.
I understand very well, but it's dangerous to play with guns.
Here, try your luck.
Three shots for 10 cents.
And you girl, go back home.
There's housekeeping to do.
We are determined not to retreat one single inch... to chase the enemy out of our country, and we will succeed whatever it takes.
I think you don't have a clue, kid.
Look closely.
Stack them this way.
See?
That's the way.
Now we place the gun.
It seems you know about this.
A little.
I learned this craft in Indochina.
And won't you join us?
No.
This quarrel is yours, I'm a foreigner.
Don't tell anyone who you are, Juanito.
If they ask, say your father runs a shop, a tailor, and your name is Zaragoza.
Zaragoza.
- Good luck, son.
We must besiege the palace.
Tear down the door.
Stop.
Brutes, savages!
Be careful!
The child!
Blessed Virgin!
Is there no one who'll protect my poor child?
Don't worry, ma'am, I'll try to help.
God bless you.
No time for gentleness now, we must avoid being walked over.
Well boy, now you can go on by yourself.
You have been very kind, sir.
- All right, all right.
Come on son, come on.
I can't get a train out of my sleeve.
We must leave as soon as possible.
Isn't there a locomotive and some wagons?
There may be a freight train coming soon.
Wait, I'll inquire if it's coming and if it's delayed.
It's the revolution, it's urgent, we can't wait.
I'm tired, Margarita.
Son, the train is coming soon.
Relax sweetheart.
I'll get you out of here.
Where's Dad?
Don't tell anyone about your dad, understood?
Your dad is fine and you'll see him very soon.
Sir, excuse me again.
Can the child stay with you for a moment?
OK.
- Because I'm going to...
Go, and return immediately.
Easy gentlemen, don't run me over.
What about that damn train?
Is it coming or not?
We know nothing.
Communications are cut.
What I can do?
The least they could do is inform people.
But hey, I can not...
It's the least you can do.
Understand that I have obligations too.
I didn't organize this revolution, you understand.
Fire at will.
The guerrillas are coming.
Don't fail to...
The train, the train!
Margarita.
So what are you doing, are you coming or not?
I can't wait.
And Margarita?
Where is Margarita?
We can't wait for her.
There's no time.
We gotta go.
Quickly.
Very kind of you.
Thank you.
Open your mouth.
Come on, open your mouth.
Men should know how to take advantage of the circumstances.
Like the old saying goes.
What could Margarita be doing?
Well...everyone knows:
surely she's running after the train.
What's your name?
Juanito.
And what else?
Esteban Álvaro Francisco Carlos María.
I mean your family name.
Meza...
Zaragoza, my father is a tailor in San Antonio Street.
Not a bad job, you have to clothe the naked.
Margarita told me...
She's your nanny, right?
Where's your mom?
Because you surely have a Mom.
Do you have a Mom?
Neither do I.
Here.
What shall I do with you, Shorty?
I want to go back to my dad.
As you see, for now you can't.
Then I'll come live with you.
No, no, that's not possible.
Now let's get that.
Here.
Wait.
You like it?
It's good.
Do you hear the bird?
He is saying, "To your health, Tom".
Because my name is Tom.
Tomás Latournes.
I'm not from this country.
But you call me Tom, just like my friends do.
So, am I your friend?
Yes.
- And where do you live?
In the woods.
- In the woods?
Are you a villain?
No, don't panic, just a hunter.
I hunt bears, wolves, everything that can be sold.
And do you have a cabin?
Great, with huge logs!
It's surrounded by large pines, and there's a lake nearby, a large lake for fishing all you want.
And in the morning when the fog lifts and the sun peeks through the clouds, deers come down to drink and you hear cries of animals you haven't heard before.
That's life, and not that of the stinking cities.
And won't you take me with you?
It's just not the right place for a kid like you.
There you wouldn't have a good bed, or a maid like Margarita...
Well, you wouldn't be comfortable.
Don't you want any more?
No, I lost my appetite.
Are we close?
No, it's still a while.
You are very tired, right?
No.
I love this place.
Oh yeah?
It's great.
We have to pass that mountain, and then another one.
From there you can see the cabin.
Then you'll perceive the delicious smell of the deer that Paddy is roasting.
Who is Paddy?
He's a very friendly guy.
He has a red nose and crooked legs.
And he roasted a whole deer?
Sure!
What do you think?
You'll see when we get there.
What do you think?
Should we wait for him a while longer Wolf?
Because I'm already hungry.
I don't mind.
That guy, what a coincidence, he always arrives when the table is set!
Wow, it's a bunny, I like it so much!
What did you bring me this time?
- See for yourself.
Let's see.
But it's a boy!
Of course.
Don't make a face.
Go fix his bed .
What bed should I fix him?
Yours, what question!
It's always me who has to sacrifice.
Yes, of course.
Where will I sleep?
- On your back.
Get off, Chucho!
You want to sleep in the bed, too?
And me?
Under the trees?
No doubt you got crazy Tom.
You bring a child, God knows where you've got him.
And now who's the babysit?
Silly Paddy.
Stop the nonsense.
I had to bring him, he was left alone at the station.
Things have turned nasty in the city.
Why nasty?
Because they're shooting again.
And how they like having fun!
Hey, what's the kid's name?
Shorty.
That's different.
At least we'd get someone to care for us when we get old.
Sure, and he'll take you out in the sun in a wheel chair, if you please.
When the revolution is over we'll take him back to the city.
His father will be looking for him.
This deed will open the gates of heaven to us.
After the action of the Lasca battalion, the city is back in our hands.
Right now the only fighting is in the suburbs.
Notify General Suarez that we absolutely need the water tank and the slaughterhouse.
Llano.
No news about the child yet?
No Excellency.
We found out that the nanny left the palace before the invasion of the rebels.
Margarita.
I am relieved.
Excellency, the women was found among the victims of the fights at the train station, dead.
We assume that one of the fugitives has helped the child to escape.
Find him.
Communicate with all authorities.
Notify the borders.
Hang posters with the child's photo everywhere... and offer a huge reward to anyone who finds him or gives news of his whereabouts.
So be it, Excellency.
Juanito Meza.
Very interesting, very interesting indeed.
It would be a big blow.
Yes, and we must do it.
Wait here.
A great opportunity, sir.
If we can seize the child, Meza would be in our hands, at our mercy, and we'll impose our conditions on him.
We'll also put up a poster and double the reward.
10,000 pesos is an incentive for the most loyal one.
I don't like these methods, Don Agapito.
I like to beat the enemy in combat, not by betrayal or cheating.
So far we have had little success by fighting.
We must use more effective ways.
And what can we do if Meza, despite everything, doesn't give in?
He'll give in.
The child is the best weapon to soften him.
I prefer that you to desist from this project.
I told you I like to fight in a fair way.
As your Excellency orders, sir.
What I dislike most is to have that man as an ally.
So do I, but we can't do anything against him, Cuesta.
He has friends, influence, political power... and we are just soldiers.
10,000 pesos.
Son of the tyrant.
Commander in chief Vegas.
Print 1000 copies.
And no doubt we'll find out where the boy is.
Everything will be done as ordered, sir.
What are you doing?
Such a courageous way of washing Shorty!
I have no fear, but the water is very cold.
At your age I had to break the ice in the well and put my head in the hole.
True, I remember it perfectly and he hasn't lost the habit.
Of course I haven't given it up!
We'll show this wimp.
Take off your shirt.
Hey, what are you gonna do?
No, not like that.
Huh?
Get down all the way.
Don't get your pants wet.
Come on!
Yes, how nice!
How nice, yes, yes!
You like it, eh?
Yes sir, I like it!
Now it's your turn.
Cleanliness comes first, because cleanliness is health.
"Cleanliness is health."
No, no, I don't want, I don't want, stop it!
Enough, no, no, enough!
Why do you say it's enough?
I don't want, I don't want.
- What do you think, eh?
Cold water for Shorty!
Great, very good, very good!
Well it wasn't that cold!
Hey Shorty!
So it wasn't that cold, eh?
Have you gone mad, get me that wet?
I don't want Shorty to flee from water like you.
Get it?
And it did you good.
It's okay we're living like savages, but the boy has to be taught, given a good example.
Let's see if for once you get it, damn it!
Set an example should not include cursing, I suppose.
Do I curse?
- Of course, many times.
Fuck you.
Shut up, there's the boy.
Come on lazy dogs, there's work to do.
Your education!
- Come on.
Let's get going.
Go!
Don't tear your pants, Shorty!
Wolf, here!
Come back!
Come back, I say!
Goodbye!
Stay with Tom.
And careful with the ax.
Don't worry.
Margarita always says there are ghosts in the forest.
Women are very superstitious.
Yes, but what if one shows up?
You scare him off with the ax.
Did you ever see a ghost?
They hide, they're scared of me.
And are you ever afraid?
No never, are you?
Neither am I. With you I won't be scared.
Tom!
Tom!
Haven't you heard?
It wasn't a ghost, it was a bird.
Look, there it is.
There, there it is!
You shouldn't make a sound, or you'll never catch anything.
When I grow up I'll be a hunter like you.
Okay, so you know how to defend yourself.
Tom!
Tom!
Where are you?
- Here, I am here!
Thanks Shorty!
Such scare we had!
You still want to be a hunter?
Yes, I want to be a hunter like you.
OK you will, but not a word to Paddy about the bear, otherwise he won't let you go out with me again.
There's something I don't understand:
how could the tree fall on you.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I tripped over a root and when I fell I got caught by the tree.
Well, you should be more careful, because any day something serious could happen to you, and it wouldn't be fun to have to dig a grave.
And where was the boy at the time?
Margarita won't let me put a knife in my mouth, because she says it's disgusting.
See if you get it!
My dad says that those who drink whiskey become fools.
And Tom is proof, just look!
And what does your dad say when you destroy your clothes like an urchin?
He would take his size and make new ones.
My dad?
Didn't you say he's a tailor?
Yes of course, but since he's not here...!
And since Paddy is not a good seamstress, we'll go to San Felipe and buy you new clothes.
Come on lazybones, get up!
In formation everyone!
You're not here to sleep!
Attention!
Good morning.
- Good morning.
What are they doing here?
They are General Vegas' men.
Meza's troops gave them a good beating.
They are retreating to the mountains, and now we have to endure them here.
And what will you do about it?
What are your men doing?
What can we do?
Wait.
They drink our wine, steal our cattle, seduce our daughters.
May the devil take them!
That's what you get for flirting.
If I'd wanted I would have gotten her!
If you'd wanted you'd gotten some slaps on your nose.
Speak proper: "your snout".
Well dismount, the party is over.
Let's dress up the boy.
Where could we...?
That.
So... this is not the child we thought.
And look, such a reward, 10,000 pesos!
Come on, let's go Shorty.
Can I have a light?
Why not, friend!
Yes.
Here you are.
That's it.
Why don't you fight on our side?
Are you afraid?
- Of course we are afraid!
I'll kill you.
You go buy the things.
We wait here.
With those eyes you'll sell anything you want.
Then buy something for the child.
Of course, beautiful one.
Give the kid a slice of melon.
And one for me too.
Thank you.
So now you're a babysitter, Paddy?
Me?
It's a prank on Tom, so he won't ask for more errands.
He's become very dainty.
Here, take this too, and if it's too big for him, he'll fix it.
At least it'll make a good bib.
He who hides Juanito Meza will be shot.
Tom, Tom!
If they catch us, they'll shoot us.
Nonsense.
Why?
Anyone who knows where the child is or has hidden him will be shot.
I just read it.
They've added it to the poster.
First they must catch us.
Yes, yes.
Where's the boy?
Oh great, there he is!
Go Shorty, let's go.
Come, come.
Walk.
Carmencita, over there is a cabin.
Maybe someone can fix the engine.
Anyone knows the kind of people living there.
Let's find out.
Hey you!
Come on, man!
Are you possessed as to shoot my hat?
Tom also shot a hat.
But it wasn't mine.
By all means!
Wait Shorty.
Let me show you how to take a good shot.
Just see.
Now!
Ha, you hit it!
Damn it!
You are a pair of thugs, when I catch you...
Hey!
Anybody there?
Wow, two women!
What about the boy?
Listen Shorty: why don't you take a little spin around... and find some mushrooms for dinner tonight?
Just now when people come over!
He won't dare I'm sure, he'll be afraid to go alone.
You say I'm afraid?
- Wanna bet?
Let's bet.
I'm not afraid.
Come on, Wolf.
He took the bait.
Ladies, did you call us?
- It's me.
Coming.
We have a problem with the engine.
We thought you could help us.
Don't worry, it's a job that has no secrets for us.
Go get the tools while I'll keep these ladies company.
Now he sends me for the tools!
It's always my turn!
Helping you Miss is a pleasure.
See, there are still guys with class!
When you smile you're much prettier.
Let's see what'll happen to this engine.
What nerve!
He always does the same to me!
Now that these girls came, I must go get the tools.
This guy always does the same thing!
Always.
The joker!
He really got me!
And he'll get the girl he likes best.
Sure, of course!
Are you going to fix the engine with that?
And why not?
I wanted to see how you live.
Thank you very much.
Take a look?
Here we sleep.
Solid beds.
Careful!
- Sorry.
And here we eat, this is our kitchen.
It's very dirty.
Yes, you can't count on Tom, he's very untidy.
And what's more: it stinks.
What stinks?
It could be the furs, we're hunters.
But we can take them out...
And this is the laundry place?
Sure, the laundry.
In this old log we do the laundry.
Here we wash.
You understand?
And what is this?
- Well, this is...
These clothes are mine.
All the washing made them shrink.
I no longer wear them.
Want me to help you with something?
No, it would spoil your hands.
Oh, it works!
How nice!
I thought you were a hunter.
If you knew the things I've done...
I was driving a truck in the Foreign Legion.
And what a truck!
Then I was a sailor and then a gold digger.
There, Miss.
When you need something again, here I am.
- Thank you.
You want one?
I haven't pulled a cigarette from a gold case for a long time.
Thank you.
- Any time.
Hey, we're back!
Here are the tools, the only ones I've found.
Where do we start?
You had a great idea, Paddy.
Give a few hacks to the canoe so they'll have to stay longer.
Do you want me to smash it?
- No, no, we gotta go.
We have to fix the engine.
- It's already fixed.
You did come in time.
So let's go.
What a pity!
And I thought... because we still have a boar ham we like to invite you over.
Stay, please!
And there are mushrooms for dessert which Shorty should have picked up...
I don't think that you agree with your partner.
No, it's not that I disagree, but... you are so pretty!
My friend is not dangerous, but...
I warn you, we're not afraid.
We were to spend the night in our tent.
Hey, where should we put Shorty?
- Great, say no more Paddy.
Let's leave them alone.
- Yes, maybe they want to tidy themselves up.
Even more?
Ladies.
At your service.
Come on, jerk!
Hey, that man seems a bit cheeky.
But he's very nice.
Tom, Paddy, look.
I've picked them myself and I wasn't afraid!
Shut up.
No need to make a fuss.
We already noticed that you're very brave.
Okay, now a quick dinner and then to bed.
But why?
What's up?
Because two ugly women showed up and I'm sure you wouldn't want to see them.
And if they're that old and ugly, why do you tidy yourselves up that much?
These are very gossipy women who would say that we are sloppy.
Start eating and stop talking.
And go sleep right away.
# With love and kisses they're waiting for me # in a little house I have in the countryside.
# It's the most humble, it's the smallest, # but it's the whitest, the whitest and the most beautiful.
# At a distance it resembles a snowflake, and a rose bush climbs up my window, # and while I sleep, the fountain sings for me, # the fountain I have by the vines,
# the fountain I have by the vines.
# I sell roses and rosemary honey, # blackberries for sauce, and some eyes, I sell.
# Deep inside they offer sweetness and consolation # and they're so blue, so blue because of looking at the sky.
# At a distance it resembles a snowflake, and up to my window a rose bush climbs, # and while I sleep, the fountain sings for me, # the fountain I have by the vines,
# the fountain I have by the vines, # the fountain I have...# Oh!
With all the noise I can't sleep.
But it's a boy!
Where did the little devil come from?
Carmencita, look what a charming kid.
- Come here.
Whose is this handsome child?
Whose can he be?
Mine of course.
Right Shorty?
Your name is Shorty?
And your mother, where's your mother?
No, I have no mother.
So who takes care of him?
I take care of Shorty.
And now I'll take you to bed, it's too late.
Sleep well, Shorty.
We also go sleep.
It was a happy coincidence that your canoe broke down so close to our cabin.
Good night.
- Good night Tom.
Couldn't we go for a short walk?
You're going too fast Paddy.
Good night.
Good night.
A farewell gift.
An ornament for the neck.
It won't bite.
Still smells a bit, but that'll fade.
Thanks Paddy, you're a good guy.
Come Shorty, it's your turn.
Here.
Tom made it.
Isn't it great?
Really?
You're an artist.
Both of you are artists.
Thank you.
- Please come back soon.
First you have to pay us a visit.
Agreed.
Where do you live?
You can be sure that we'll visit.
At the estate of my brother.
It's in Quebrada de las Yeguas, near La Juana, you ask for us there.
After this revolution we'll pay you a visit.
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Hey Tom, why did you say you were my father?
Did you want me to say you're the son of tailor Zaragoza?
I have to tell you something.
No need, we know who you are.
Who told you that?
They're looking for you, and I don't know what they'd do with you if they found you, that's why I said you're my son.
They won't look for you here and when it's all over, we'll take you to your father.
Yes.
In a canoe like this one, by the lake, and then we'll continue downstream.
# Finishing the canoe I am.
# Sailing the river we'll go.
# To the forest, on leaving, we're going to say goodbye.
# Strike, strike the ax nonstop.
Together we will make fun of the dangers.
# Let's work always with determination # happily singing the song. #
But what happened here?
Carmencita, my little dove!
What's up, Salome?
What pleasure!
What a joy to have you back!
Have you seen how awful?
Carmencita.
Carmencita!
Hello.
- Hello, Luisa.
What are you doing here?
Did something happen to you, Emilio?
Fortunes of war.
Sometimes you advance and then you retreat.
And you're now receding.
Yes, that's why General Vegas installed his headquarters here.
I demand the utmost respect for our guests.
I don't want the fate of war influence the ways of the Cuesta family.
All right.
I'll do what you command, brother.
Goodbye, Luisa.
- Goodbye.
I like your brother's way, but now it will be difficult to stay that way.
Hey, look!
Juanito Meza.
Son of the President!
And this shameless Tom told us so proud that he was his son.
For a man to say that he's not the father of a child is normal, but to make us believe he is when he's not, that's something new.
He couldn't expose the child.
Sure, it's only natural that you excuse him!
No woman, let me explain.
I know what you're going to tell me:
that those hunters are men of truth.
Come girls, the water is warm!
All right, then let's go!
- Let's go.
Luisa, let's make a vow: we won't talk to anyone about this kid.
Of course not.
They would find him and kill him, and also kill those two nice guys, and we still need them.
Right?
What hurts me is having to give up the reward of 10,000 pesos!
What a vermin you are!
You'll pay me back for that!
By your side ladies, the hardships of war are easily forgotten.
That's all we can give the soldiers: some peace.
So far we noticed mostly the absence of the ladies.
If we knew you'd installed your headquarters here we would have returned immediately.
Especially because the situation can change from one moment to the next.
For now things seem unlikely to change, unless Meza manages to cut off the road to the border, in which case we will be in a compromising position.
That's why I insist on chasing Meza's son as a hostage.
It would be a decisive asset for us, and the threat of shooting anyone who hides him, should bear results, not to forget the considerable incentive of the 10,000 pesos reward.
I told you Don Agapito, that I don't like these tactics.
I know, Excellency, but big problems call for big solutions.
This is the most effective way to have Meza in our hands.
It's like a life insurance for all of us and the likelihood of achieving success.
And this is how politics are made, Don Agapito?
I thought that politics was not at odds with consciousness.
You are still very young, miss.
The General should not be disturbed.
- Sorry, but I have to see him.
Excellency, a messenger.
General.
- Speak.
Commander Ramirez sent me to inform you that an enemy brigade... advances to Sierra Negra near the border.
We have to stop them whatever it takes.
Take command of our men, Colonel Cuesta.
Our fate may depend on this action, Colonel.
I know.
At your orders, sir.
Emilio.
Don't worry.
Serve the guests.
May God protect you, brother.
Hey look, I found marshmallows.
No use for them.
And these Boldo leaves.
But that's for the liver, stupid!
And this is lime.
Well, lime is another matter.
I remember my mother made me tea and it did me good.
Make him a cup.
But outside, so we won't get smoke in the cabin.
Will you shut up?
What a fuss, having a sick kid at home!
You should know, stupid!
Hey, why stupid!
- I was talking to the dog.
Come on, hurry up.
Ah, I thought you talked to me!
# Juanito was lying because he was constipated.
# The doctor gave him warm tea to see if he got better. #
Give me a hand, man.
- And Shorty, since he's so nice... will take some lime tea, which will do you good.
Come on Shorty, open your mouth!
You don't want it, as tasty as it is?
Well, then I will give it to you in a different way.
Let's see: one spoon for your dad.
Very well.
Another one for Paddy the fool.
And another one for Tom the brute.
And this one for the pretty lady.
For which one?
Yours?
- That's it, Shorty.
That's it.
All gone.
You see it'll do you good.
Now go sleep, go sleep.
When you wake up you'll be able to run around.
Won't you stay with me, Paddy?
I'll stay out there.
- No, I want you to stay here.
Okay I'll stay, but you go sleep.
What are you doing, Tom?
I'm making an Indian drawing.
In this canoe we'll be sailing, you and I, and we'll take Paddy along and Wolf.
Come on Tom, sing me that song of the hunter in the woods.
Yes Tom, I'll play along.
# I'm walking in the forest # because there my faithful companions # are the trees, with their rustle, # that help me dream better.
# In the forest I'll always find # good hunting, which is what I want, # but I also like to watch # the bird fly happily.
# It is the fate of this life:
# like a very fast deer # you can miss it # if you're not a good hunter.
# And my friend the forest it shared # my sorrows and my joys, # and the trees with their rustle # sing together my song. #
Did the fever get higher?
Yes.
Paddy.
Get up.
- What is it?
I think he is getting worse.
What do we do?
We can't go on like this.
We must do something.
I'm going to San Felipe and bring the doctor.
And if he recognizes him and tells on us back in town?
Then they'll shoot or hang us.
You have to take risks.
If he betrays us, so be it.
And won't there be any chance to save him?
Perhaps my General.
Maybe we can disarm Meza by making him believe that we have his child in our hands, that we offer to swap him for the colonel and that if he dies, the child will suffer the same fate.
This will give us...that is you, a great strategic advantage, and this could end in our favor.
But are you sure that he'll yield to this threat?
I'm sure that Meza, like all parents who had a late child, feels great affection for this kid, and he would do anything for him.
Yes, it's serious.
Did this child live in the mountains a long time?
But isn't this a healthy climate?
The height makes children strong.
It depends on the environment they're used to.
Your wife was Creole?
My wife?
No, I ask because of his features.
I leave these medicines.
The most he needs is plenty of rest.
Go ahead, doctor.
Your fee, doctor?
We'll settle that later.
I hope you don't forget the great responsibility that you have for that child.
Thank you, doctor.
We won't forget.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, doctor.
Hey, what did he mean to tell us?
Did he notice?
I don't know. "Our responsibility".
Is there any new news?
Meza asks to bring his child within three days, otherwise he'll shoot your brother.
We have to deliver the kid, because...
my brother's life is at stake.
Carmencita!
Excellency!
Did you already know, my daughter?
Yes Excellency, but I also know where Juanito Meza is hidden.
The son of Meza?
This is great news, Miss.
Carras!
I hope you'll give us all the necessary details, it's paramount.
I will say nothing.
But I am willing to hand over the child on the condition that I go get him alone, and no one tries to make inquiries later.
Anyway, I think you should have an escort.
Thanks, no need for that.
Goodbye.
I have to announce something very important:
I know where the son of President Meza is.
Some hunters who live near the lake keep him.
All right, you go Sergeant.
- Move!
Tom.
Tom!
What a surprise!
What brings one of our beautiful friends here?
I'm glad you came.
We are in trouble.
Tom, help me.
My brother was made prisoner by Meza's forces.
They'll shoot him.
Shoot him?
Why?
He commanded a brigade of General Vegas.
Darn, he fought with the rebels!
The President will forgive him if we deliver the child immediately.
What do you mean?
You know very well what I mean.
This is no time for deception.
But how did you know?
I came alone, you see.
I said nothing of the whereabouts of the boy.
But I beg you to give him to me.
Nothing will happen to him nor to you.
I'll take him to his father myself.
No.
It's not possible.
Tom...
- Come with me.
Take care of the horse.
The fever lasts already for three days.
Understand that it'll be a crime to take him out of here, and even more to ride such a long distance.
The thing with your brother is very sad,
but he's a military guy, and when revolting he knows the risk he takes.
The child's life is in danger, and he's the least guilty of all.
So can't we do anything?
Wait.
Hey Carmen, for heaven's sake, I don't want you to leave this way, maybe we can still do something.
I will cross the combat line this evening, see the President and give him my word that his child is safe.
I'm sure he'll believe me... and cancel the order to shoot your brother.
Please don't cry.
You'll see everything will work out.
I want to see you smile.
Well, listen to me, what did you tell her?
It's a long story and there's no time.
Take care of the child.
I have to see the president, whatever it takes.
But can't you at least tell me what you agreed on with Carmencita?
Didn't I say I can't spare a minute?
What happened?
Speak Paddy, answer me!
Tell me what happened!
The pigs...
I shut the door well but they broke it down and took the child.
Tell me who it was.
I don't know...
They hit me on the head.
Come on, wake up, I need you to tell me who these men were.
What a pest your Carmencita!
She was the one who brought them here.
Did she come with them?
- No.
She may...
They returned to finish us off!
No, these are Meza's soldiers.
We know you hid the son of President Meza.
Where is he?
You came too late, Sgt. The child is no longer here.
How come, wasn't he sick?
- Yes.
You have handed him over to Vegas' men.
- We?
Hold it!
We'll clarify that soon.
Let's go.
Ah, good shot, yes, sir!
You did it, Carras.
But what's wrong with him?
Is he sick?
Apparently.
Have they brought the child?
And where is Miss Cuesta?
Ms. Cuesta hasn't returned yet.
So what does the little one do here?
I wanted to make sure and I rather had my men bring him in.
No reason to miss the coup.
And what happened to the hunters?
What did they do to them?
Almost nothing, we were in a hurry.
If you knew how much I hate you all!
My God, the fever burns him up!
He's quite bad.
Sorry to move him sick like this.
His father gave us very little time.
We have to take him to bed.
Give him to me.
No, our fate depends on him.
I want to give him to his father before he dies.
Let's march, Carras.
You wouldn't care less if he dies, right?
In wars and revolutions these things happen, Miss.
Where is the General?
What does it matter where he is?
Here just happens what I command and nothing else.
You are lying.
You handed the child over to collect the reward offered by these traitors.
It's written here clearly.
I wish you wouldn't speak like that.
We treated the child with the greatest care.
Right Paddy?
Don't just stand there, say something.
My friend tried to cross the lines to tell you where the child was.
And why didn't he come?
He had just left when I was attacked, then he heard the shots and came back.
Look, look where I was wounded.
Stop right there.
Who ordered you to move?
Easy, easy.
Sir, I beg you to think about it.
It is precisely what I'm doing.
If Vegas' men had found the child you would've been shot.
You're alive.
This shows that you've sold the kid.
You've handed him over so to cash in those 10,000 pesos.
For guys like you, trials are a waste.
Take them.
Come.
- Okay, sir...!
Take it easy.
The fence is very solid.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Do you also...?
I am Colonel Cuesta.
- What?
Colonel Cuesta?
Glad to meet you personally.
My name's Latournes and this is my friend Paddy.
Do you have news from the front?
What do you know about General Vegas?
General Vegas...!
May the devil take him and all his gang!
Don't pay attention to him, Colonel.
Vargas' supporters beat him up.
By the way Tom, we should thank the Colonel for the betrayal by his sister.
Don't mind him.
He doesn't know what he says.
Ah, but...you know my sister?
Yes, we know her.
Your sister had a big concern for you, she knew they were going to shoot you, and the only way around it was handing over Meza's son.
And as Juanito was with us in the bush, in our cabin,...
What most infuriates me is that they took the boy even when he was so sick.
Don't worry, he'll be treated well.
The salvation of us all depends on his life .
You, your only concern is yourselves!
What matters to me is the salvation of the child.
Sorry I can't give you good news, Excellency.
It was a crime to bring Juanito in this shape.
Thank you.
Be sure to keep me informed.
Now I have to work.
And what do we do with Cuesta, Excellency?
Let him free.
Will you keep your promise, Excellency?
This is a rebel, a rebel military.
I gave my word.
He can also be useful as an intermediary... to obtain the surrender of General Vegas.
Come with me to the office.
I bring an order from the President...
Excuse me, sir.
Did they bring the child?
I mean the President's son.
Juanito Meza.
- Yes.
So?
Then everything should be clarified.
How's the boy?
What did the President say?
He surely knows we're innocent.
Shut up.
It'll be your turn later.
Colonel Cuesta, follow me.
I have orders to release you and accompany you to the headquarters of Vegas.
I have the instructions here.
I will also have you released.
Good luck.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I would like to talk to the President about these two hunters who are not guilty of anything.
We have orders to leave immediately.
The fate of these men is not your concern
Hey, Sarge!
Sergeant, Sergeant, come!
What?
We need you to clarify this situation.
This is nonsense, a mistake.
Listen to me:
I want you to take me to the President, or rather to the child.
The child is dying and your fate is sealed.
What, is he dying?
Our fate doesn't matter.
I after all...and neither you.
But poor Shorty...
I'm here.
Carmencita.
- Emilio.
I have to see the General immediately.
I have to fulfill a mission that can save many lives.
Emilio, when will this horrible nightmare end?
Hopefully soon, but hear me out:
in the Holy Trinity are the two hunters you know.
They're going to shoot them.
Shoot them?
Holy God!
Why?
They are convinced that they handed over the child to get the reward of Don Agapito.
I haven't been able to do anything.
And what do you think I can do for them?
Why not try to talk to the President?
If you could convince him, they'll be saved.
Colonel Cuesta.
- Let's go.
Goodbye.
Get the car Antonio.
Quick.
I always made fun of people who spoil their children.
Now I don't laugh at them anymore.
I understand them perfectly.
This kid has managed to take over my love.
I can't believe he's dying.
But you don't understand me.
Why do you say I don't understand you?
Or do you think I have no heart, that I'm a piece of wood?
Sorry Paddy, I didn't mean to offend you.
Sorry.
Do you think the guy who stands guard would take a letter to Carmen after I die?
But she doesn't care at all, she just wanted to save her brother!
You don't know her, Paddy.
Something unexpected must have happened, something we don't know.
If she knew our whereabouts she'd do anything to come to our aid.
She knows that I think of her.
Hey Tom, I've the impression that you talk like you're in love with this woman.
And I am.
Didn't you notice?
But it's too late.
We want to see the President.
Impossible Miss.
We can't bother his Excellency for any reason.
But will you announce us at least?
I can't announce anyone, those are my orders.
No way.
I want to talk to the chief of guard.
What happens there?
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you ask, Sgt. I want to see his Excellency.
Even if you give me 1 million pesos I could do nothing.
His Excellency can't receive you.
He has enough trouble with his son who is dying.
Go away.
Hey Lieutenant, we have to talk to his Excellency.
It's this way, right?
- Please miss, you can't pass.
Four men to arrest one woman?
But hey, Missy!
Don Alvaro, out of charity, listen for one moment.
The two imprisoned hunters are innocent.
They didn't sell your son to the rebels.
I've been informed on the subject, lady.
I'm the only one to blame, because of me, Don Agapito heard of his hiding place.
They followed me and kidnapped him.
At exactly that same time one of the hunters was on his way to talk to his Excellency.
This is no time to deal with this unpleasant business.
Good night.
Listen: these two men have taken care of your son with great affection, with the greatest efforts.
I swear.
They've spent whole nights at his bed and even made him toys.
Look.
Here's proof.
This canoe was made by Tom for Juanito to play with.
Why not take it to him to see?
Surely he will recognize it.
Give it to him, Excellency, please.
Come with me.
Juanito, Juanito my son!
Tom.
Here go my friends Tom and Shorty, when I grow up I want to be a hunter like you, and we won't take that fool Paddy because he has to fix the meal.
Come.
Well Paddy, it's time.
What day is it?
- I think it's Monday.
Good way to start the week.
- The firing squad!
Stop!
Left!
We'll be shot.
Don't worry Tom, in a little while we'll be in heaven.
Attention!
Shoulder arms.
Hey, you!
Why are you standing there?
Keep walking, this isn't for us.
Turn.
You stay here.
Follow me.
Come in, but don't speak.
Can't you see you'll wake him?
Tom, Paddy!
Hello, great Indian chief!
Such nice bed!
Huh?
You would even want to be sick.
What's up Shorty, a hunter like you in bed at this hour?
Tom, sing the song of the hunter.
Carmen!
Madonna, the revolution!
Only one more week, Carmen.
After that we'll be together.
It's funny:
my mother always told me: "Tom, my son, you'll never conquer a girl."
You vain person, it was me who conquered you!
Don't you forget it.
Luisa, my love, I want to ask you something.
How many shorties...
I mean children, do you want to have?
But we're not even married yet!
Yes!
But you have to think of everything:
the geranium, the primer of large family, expand the cabin...
Don't go on.
Long live President Meza!
There they are!
Hello Shorty!
- Tom, Paddy!
Shorty, come here!
It was impossible to keep him at home.
I hope you don't mind taking him with you for a few days.
Of course not, Mr. President.
The opposite.
Thank you Mr. President, for your generosity.
You helped to hasten the end.
Besides, we all wanted the same thing:
happiness for our country, no more revolutions.
Until next time.
- Huh?
No, I mean: see you next time, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Here Juanito.
Goodbye Colonel.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye Carmen.
- Goodbye.

My glasses.
Should make you feel pretty good, Matt.
Number 50 leaving San Francisco flying the Cabot flag.
I want a full report on why she sailed 40 minutes late.
If it was the dock force, not a man stays on our hiring list.
Did you get that?
Yep.
First thing in the morning.
First thing this afternoon.
Forget your golf game just once.
Where were we, Miss Lee?
The radio to the captain of...
Yeah.
"Proceed under tow to Hong Kong for repairs..."
Bad today?
Don't hold your breath, Howard.
I'll be around for a while yet.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what it means.
"Proceed under tow to Hong Kong for repairs.
"First mate will relieve you, pending inquiry into collision.
Cabot."
That's all, Miss Lee.
Yes, Mr. Cabot.
You got anything more?
Nothing pressing.
Longshoremen are talking strike again, but so far it's just talk.
And we don't have to decide that tug contract till the 10th.
I've already decided.
It goes to Acme Towing.
Acme?
What for?
They'll do the best job.
Draw up a letter of agreement.
Matt, you know who runs Acme Towing?
I know everything on the waterfront and a few miles inland.
You're ready to trust Joe Richards' son with a million tons of Cabot shipping?
What has trust got to do with it?
I don't trust you, either.
I keep you around because you're the best man for the job.
I also know where a few bodies are buried.
I guess we both do, Matt.
Fair enough.
On your way out, tell Sheila I want her up here.
Sheila.
Did I startle you?
Why do you walk so quietly, Howard?
Maybe it's something to do with this house.
I bring a summons.
The affairs of empire having been settled for the day, your presence is commanded above.
Thank you.
He's a little late today, isn't he?
I mean, that would be Dr. Rivera, wouldn't it?
Well, he is expected.
Matt really likes that fellow, doesn't he?
He seems to.
DO you?
Well, yes.
Don't you?
Me?
I like everybody.
I just can't stand the smell of ether.
Come in, Doctor.
Tawny.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Cabot.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Mr. Mason.
How are you, Rivera?
May I take your coat?
Thank you, Tawny.
I'm sorry I'm late.
An operation with a few unforeseen complications.
You made out all right, I presume.
I think so.
And the patient?
Equally all right?
Sheila!
If that's the doctor, get him up here!
Excuse us.
Well, what sort of day, Mr. Cabot?
My ships are late.
My doctor's late.
Apart from that, like any other day.
Pain bad?
That's one thing I can depend on.
It was on time.
More severe than yesterday?
I don't measure it.
I'm getting to be as bad as those hop-heads on the waterfront.
Can't go through the day without a fix.
What's so funny?
I don't like having to depend on anything or anybody!
What's this I hear about you running out on me?
Switzerland, isn't it?
Who told you that?
Your distinguished predecessor, Dr. Kessler.
Chief of staff of some big hospital, he tells me.
Why didn't you tell me yourself?
I haven't decided to go yet.
You're meeting the director of the Zurich Hospital tonight, aren't you?
To hear what he has to say, yes.
What's so special in Zurich?
Money?
No.
Facilities for independent research, mainly.
That still leaves me here.
Who takes your place?
Hold still.
I think Dr. Beloit would be the best.
Beloit, huh?
Is he a good man?
I'm sure Dr. Kessler would recommend him.
He already has.
All right.
Bring him along tomorrow.
If I decide to go.
You'll go.
Quite a feather for the son of a Napa Valley fruit picker.
You'll go, all right.
You're the type.
Dedicated, that's the word, isn't it?
I hope you have a comfortable night, Mr. Cabot.
Yeah, sure.
All right, Sheila.
The doctor knows his way out by now.
If I'm needed, I'll be at home.
Three minutes, that's all it'll take.
Too much to ask of my wife?
No, Matt.
Of course, it could go a few seconds overtime.
It takes a bit longer every day.
The magic needle.
The miracle of medicine.
Kills the pain, keeps a man alive for years.
Well, half alive, anyway.
Too bad they can't find something for your condition.
That would really be a miracle, wouldn't it, Sheila?
A vitamin shot for love deficiency.
Is there anything else, Matt?
Yes.
I got something in the mail today, about you.
About me?
A Photostat.
"Department of Motor Vehicles,
"learner permit issued to Sheila Cabot, the 16th."
That's day before yesterday.
Your friends are everywhere, aren't they?
Why, all of a sudden, do you want to drive?
Well, why do you make it sound like a criminal offense?
Chauffeur and limousine not enough anymore?
Not enough privacy, huh?
Matt, your own daughter drives.
Her mother used to drive...
Where would you drive to?
Why, I don't know.
I haven't given it much thought.
The hairdresser, stores, friends...
That's what I pay Cobb for.
Well, and sometimes nowhere, nowhere at all!
Just to drive!
Just to be alone!
Listen, you're my wife!
You don't go anywhere alone!
Matt, you're hurting me.
Just learn to take it, like I did.
You don't need any permit for that.
All right, your three minutes are up.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Peter, your father's sleeping.
Look what Miss Lee brought me from the office.
All airmails.
My-
They're from all over the world, aren't they?
Did you remember to thank Miss Lee?
I think so.
Will you help me paste them in?
Well, not right now, darling.
Tonight before you go to bed.
All right?
Okay.
I'll go and sort them out.
Yes?
Tawny, I'm going out.
Mr. Cabot is sleeping, but I'd like you to look in on him while I'm gone.
Yes, Mrs. Cabot.
Cobb is here now.
I'll tell him.
Mrs. Cabot wants you to bring the car around.
Wouldn't you know?
The whole day to choose from, and she has to pick this minute.
She would like it at once.
Naturally.
The car sits in the garage for days with the battery draining away.
But when she wants it, it's right now.
On the dot.
With no regard for the fate of my investments.
You're well-paid for doing very little.
Little?
Parading around in this monkey suit?
I won't be wearing it all my life.
One of these days my luck will hit, and I'll take the track home with me.
Then it'll be Top of the Mark for Cobb O'Brien.
In the meanwhile, bring the car around.
There speaks the wisdom of the inscrutable East.
You ought to save it for a fortune cookie.
How's Father?
He's sleeping.
Dr. Rivera was just here, and he gave him a sedative.
And you're going out?
I have some shopping to do downtown.
Tawny will look after him.
She doesn't have to.
I will.
Cathy...
Yes?
I haven't been out of the house in three days.
I need a breath of air.
Surely you can't object to that.
Enjoy yourself, Sheila.
Pick me up in an hour, Cobb.
"He, IRS-gm'?
Well, yes.
Why?
The store closes in 45 minutes, ma'am.
All right.
Forty-five minutes, then.
On the dot, ma'am.
Thank you.
1201 Divisadero Street.
I was hoping you'd be able to get away.
I had to, David.
Today of all days.
Sheila, about Zurich...
I wanted to tell you.
Not now, darling.
Don't say anything for a moment.
Just hold me, please.
Darling.
Oh, darling!
Darling.
It is true, then.
Darling, now, sit down.
May I take your coat?
No, David.
I can't stay long.
Is it true?
Yes.
Sheila, please look at me.
It sounds like a splendid opportunity for you.
Yes, it is.
It's...
It's the kind of thing you've always wanted, isn't it?
Sheila...
In Switzerland.
Such a beautiful country, and so clean and so...
Don't cry, darling.
Please, please don't cry.
No, I'm not.
The only other time I saw you cry was the first day you came here.
Those were very different tears.
Yes.
Oh, David.
David.
It's strange what goes through one's mind at a time like this.
All I can think of is...
I've never known what it's like to awaken from sleep
and find you beside me.
And now I never will.
You will, darling.
Believe me, you will.
It's only a matter of time.
No.
Your husband's not going to get well.
His condition is hopeless.
So is mine.
If you could only leave him.
Sheila, come with me.
How?
Just pick up and run away?
He'd never give me a divorce, you know that.
And Peter...
Matt would hound me to the ends of the Earth to take him away from me.
And he'd destroy you, too, David.
He'd see to it that you could never practice medicine again as long as you lived.
I know, I know!
How well I know.
Oh, my God, if anybody had ever told me that I would be praying for the death of one of my own patients...
I know what hell it's been for you, just as it has been for me.
All those hours of lying and plotting and sneaking through side exits just for a few moments together.
But when I think of what my life would be without them, I...
Sheila, please.
Don't leave me, David.
Please don't go away.
I've got to go.
But why, darling, why?
I don't know what I'll do if you go.
I'm afraid of what I'll do if I stay.
Afraid?
Look at this.
It's more deadly than a gun.
A thousand times less detectable.
I use it every day on him.
David.
Have you any idea of how easy it would be?
Nothing so crude as an overdose of his daily injection.
That could be discovered in an autopsy.
A simple bubble of air, that's all it would take.
Don't, David.
Don't even think it.
Don't think it?
Day and night for months I've thought of nothing else.
Sheila, I've got to get away.
I don't dare stay!
When will you go?
Soon.
Tomorrow night.
Then this is the last time I'll see you?
No, I'll be by tomorrow with the new doctor.
A public farewell.
Goodbye.
Sheila.
Wait.
Tawny, show Dr. Rivera and Dr. Beloit directly to Mr. Cabofs room.
Yes, Mrs. Cabot.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good afternoon, Tawny.
Are you alone?
Yes, Tawny, I am.
Honey, the way you push that Crackerbox, one of these days you're gonna wind up in my engine room the hard way.
This can't wait.
Blake, I've got wonderful news.
Well, next time use the phone.
It's safer.
If I'd known you were hauling fertilizer again, I would have.
Phew!
It may be "phew" to you, honey, but it's bread and butter to me.
What's up?
Blake, what do you want more than anything else in the world?
No, next to that.
A load of Chanel No. 5.
Blake, I'm serious.
Well, in that case, I wouldn't turn down a couple of new towing contracts.
Well, would you settle for one?
The Cabot Line?
Yeah, if you twisted my arm.
Well, hold tight, darling.
I think you've got it.
Are you sure?
Well, pretty sure.
I talked to Miss Lee down at the office.
And she said she wasn't at liberty to tell me, but, well, then she winked at me.
Winked, did she?
Which eye?
Right or left?
Blake, are you kidding me?
Have you heard anything?
I hate to spoil your surprise, honey, but I got more than a wink this morning.
A call from your father, direct.
Blake, that's wonderful!
Did...
Did you tell him anything about...
About us?
No, Cathy.
And I'm not going to.
I've lived with this for a long time.
You want to tell him?
Fine.
He's your father.
But my father's dead, and the Cabot Line's the reason why.
Matt Cabot gives me a contract, okay, I do my job.
But Blake...
I know, honey.
It's easy for me.
Everything's simple.
I love you and I want to marry you.
It's more complicated for you.
You've got a tough decision to make.
Well, I've made it, Blake.
You better be sure, Cathy.
Real sure.
It's a long step down from a Cabot liner to an Acme tug.
I'll float down.
You know, this is the first time you've ever mentioned marriage.
Did I do that?
You must've caught me in a weak moment.
Well, it's high time.
Blake!
Look!
Lord, what is man that Thou takest knowledge of him?
His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
For the wind passeth over it and it is gone.
And the place thereof shall know it no more.
And the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting.
I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord.
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
And unto the dust from which we came, we commend this body where it shall rest until the final day of judgment in the sight of our Lord.
Amen.
Would you like me to drive back to the house with you?
No, thank you, Howard.
I think it would be better if I were alone with the children.
I don't know what I can say, Cathy.
You've said it, Blake, just by being here.
Cathy?
You go on to the car, Sheila.
I'll be there in a moment.
Would it be okay if I called you tonight?
Please.
David.
Catherine, dear.
Dr. Kessler.
David, I...
Well, I wanted to tell you,
I mean, everyone's been so kind and sympathetic to the family.
Well, I couldn't help thinking how awful the doctor must feel.
Please don't think we're not grateful.
We are.
Father was so vital.
For him to be chained to a bed for the rest of his life...
I don't know.
I think it's better this way, quickly and peacefull in his sleep.
Don't you?
Well, I...
If he doesn't answer that, it's only because of something we call medical ethics.
Well, anyway, David.
I wanted you to know.
Goodbye.
Bye, Cathy.
You know, in my time, if a young girl called a doctor by his first name, somebody would have taken a gun to him.
Nowadays, the girls are older and doctors are younger.
It's our educational system.
Older, younger...
I still go 18 holes a day at Pebble Beach.
Bring your clubs some time.
I'll beat the pants off you.
What's the old man trying to do?
Change your mind about that Zurich job?
No, we didn't discuss it.
Why do you ask?
It was practically all he talked about on the golf course the other day.
He thinks you're a chump.
Really?
How do you feel about it?
Me?
I have no feeling about it, one way or the other.
Should I have?
I don't know.
I was just wondering.
Well, it's hardly worth brooding about.
Hardly.
I'll probably get around to it one of these days.
I hope so.
I think it would be very good for you.
Magic needle...
Kills the pain, keeps a man alive for years.
Deadly as a gun, a thousand times less detectable.
And unto the dust from which we came we commend your body, No.
Too bad they can't find something for your condition.
No, please don't!
A simple bubble of air, that's all it would take.
Matt, you're hurting me.
No!
No!
Tawny?
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Cabot.
Why are you up?
I couldn't understand it, but the buzzer rang downstairs from Mr. Cabofs room.
Yes, it was Rajah.
He woke me, too.
He must be very lonely now.
Please see that he's kept downstairs.
Yes, Mrs. Cabot.
Dr. Rivera speaking.
David.
Sheila.
You know you mustn't call me from the house.
It's insane.
But when am I going to see you?
David, it's so horrible alone.
May I come to your place tomorrow?
No, Sheila, no.
We don't dare.
Not yet.
But I've got to see you.
I can't sleep.
I keep hearing sounds from his room.
Please, darling.
Please, I must see you or I'll...
Oh, God, David, I'm sick!
Help me, please!
All right, Sheila.
Try to get a hold of yourself.
I'll come by.
When?
When?
First chance I get.
But when, David?
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
Now, will you please get some sleep?
Yes, I'll try, but...
Oh, darling, I need you.
I need you so much.
Shei...
Howard, it's only one day after the funeral.
I can't read all those legal documents today.
I'm not asking you to read them.
All you have to do is sign them.
But why just this minute?
Because the waterfront's boiling over, and I'm sitting on the lid.
A couple of weak sisters in the Association have been talking about signing a separate contract with the Union.
I've got to hold them in line.
And I can't do that unless I speak for Cabot with full Power of Attorney to back me up.
Please, Howard!
Please, I'm just not up to it.
Is it really as bad as all that?
Prostrated with grief?
Isn't there maybe the slightest sense of relief at being free after all these years?
I wondered just how long you'd wait before saying something like that.
I've been waiting for years, Sheila.
You've always known that.
Yes, I suppose I have.
You made it very clear, right in this room
the night they took Matt to the hospital.
You're not going to hold that against me, are you?
After all this time?
It was no then, Howard.
It's still no.
I was in love with you that night.
I still am.
Love?
I know you wanted me, but it's not quite the same thing.
All right, I wanted you.
Let's not quibble over words.
I'm sure you've known any number of women who wouldn't quibble over words.
Sheila, I want to marry you.
I've never said that to any other woman.
I'm sorry, Howard, but I don't want to marry you.
Why?
ls there somebody else?
Well, I could hardly blame you.
A beautiful woman, young, healthy, with healthy appetites, married for years to, shall we say, half a man?
After all, you...
Howard.
I think you'd better leave, and now.
I hadn't planned to talk about this today, but you're going to find that you need me, Sheila.
I can wait a little longer.
Sign the papers.
Don't wait, Howard.
It's no use.
We'll see.
I usually get what I want, one way or another.
That's right, they'll never strike.
If we stick together, we'll break their backs, and they know it.
That's why I want a unanimous vote at that meeting.
Excuse me, Frank.
I'll have to call you back.
Tell your friends to take their hands off before somebody gets hurt.
All right, boys.
Now, we have a custom around here.
We knock before entering an office.
My name is Blake Richards.
I know who you are.
I trust I won't have to ask you to speak up, Mr. Richards?
The word's around that you've given Bill Coleman your towing contract.
How does that concern you?
That contract's mine.
Yours?
That's interesting.
Cabot called me about it himself, the day before he died.
I find that hard to believe.
We discussed your bid and rejected it.
Well, then why did he phone me?
Why did he tell me he was drawing up a letter of agreement?
I don't believe that he did.
Miss Lee, will you come in, please?
What're you trying to pull?
Yes, Mr. Mason?
Miss Lee, I want you to think very carefully before you answer this.
A great deal depends on it.
Do you know of anything about a letter of agreement between Mr. Cabot and Mr. Richards here?
No, Mr. Mason.
Well, Richards, you satisfied?
You tell her straight out she'd better lie if she knows what's good for her, so she lies.
Who do you think you're kidding?
You've got your answer, now get out.
You're not getting away with this, Mason.
Because I'm not the only one who knew about that agreement.
His daughter knew about it, too.
I see.
Well, suppose I told you that Matt Cabot knew about the way you were using his daughter.
That's one of the reasons we turned you down.
There are a lot of ways to get ahead in this world, boy, but that's about as low as you can get.
Why, you dirty...
No wonder Cabot was able to break my father.
He wouldn't fight like that.
But I will.
Remember that, Mason.
I don't break that easy.
I'm not through with you yet.
Blake.
What happened?
Well, from what Miss Lee says, there never was a contract.
She didn't wink at you that day.
She must have had something in her eye.
That's not true.
I know it isn't.
So do I. But that doesn't help much.
I'll see about that!
I'm going up there and I'm...
And do what?
Stamp your pretty little foot?
You know, Mason says it's on account of us that they lowered the boom.
You mean he knows about us?
Oh, yes, indeed.
And so did your father.
You know, he probably also knew about the two new tugs I contracted for, and the crews I signed on.
They made sure I was carrying a full cargo before they scuttled me.
You better run along.
Will you call me?
Yeah, if I can manage to keep my head above water.
Not many phone booths at the bottom of the bay.
I'll see you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What are you doing with the mail?
Well, is it a crime to be expecting a letter?
From whom?
That man who came to see you the other night?
I heard him warning you.
If Mrs. Cabot finds out people like that are coming to the house, you won't be here much longer.
I'll take it, please.
Don't start packing my bags just yet.
It's still even money which one of us will be the first out of the starting gate.
What do you mean by that?
Well, it was the first Mrs. Cabot brought you here, wasn't it?
Now that the old man's gone, who knows?
Good afternoon, Miss Cathy.
Quite a batch of mail today.
Thank you, Cobb.
Is that Dr. Rivera's car, Tawny?
Yes.
He's in the library with Mrs. Cabot.
There's really nothing to worry about, Mrs. Cabot.
I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't interrupt anything.
It's all right, Cathy.
I was just finishing.
I'll give you a prescription to help you sleep.
Sheila.
Yes?
Did Father happen to mention anything last week about a contract with Blake Richards?
He never discussed business with me, Cathy.
Why?
It doesn't matter.
Are you all right, Cathy?
Yes, I'm fine.
Here's the mail.
Thank you, dear.
Would you put it on the desk, please?
You haven't opened yesterday's mail.
Well, I'll get to them all later.
They're mostly sympathy letters.
Don't you need sympathy, Sheila?
Cathy.
I am sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Excuse me, David.
That could've been very bad.
I'm sure she didn't notice anything.
Sheila, you've got to be more careful.
At a time like this, neglecting sympathy letters, that's just the sort of thing that could give us away.
You're right, David.
I didn't think.
I just couldn't face them.
I know, I know.
Will you take care of them?
Sheila, I have to go.
But you just got here a moment ago.
Cathy saw me write the prescription.
That usually comes at the end of a professional visit.
When will I see you again?
Not until it's safe.
David, are you making excuses?
Sheila.
You know that isn't true.
This was supposed to bring us together.
Now it's only keeping us apart.
Ironic, isn't it?
Darling, we have a lot at stake.
All right, David.
You go along to your hospital.
I'll comfort myself with these.
Please try to understand.
We don't dare.
"Dear Mrs. Cabot,
"I knew and respected your husband for 30 years..."
Sheila, don't make it worse than it is.
"My dear Mrs. Cabot, what small comfort can a letter be?"
Darling, it's only for just a little while longer.
I know.
Goodbye.
David!
Look at this.
"Dear Mrs. Cabot,
"congratulations on the success of your murder."
Will you take over, John?
Sheila.
How did you get here?
It's all right.
I changed cabs twice.
David, what about the letter?
I've been over it a thousand times.
What can you find from an anonymous letter?
Printed words, dime store paper?
He knew that when he wrote it.
We don't even know that it was a man.
All we have to go on is a postmark.
Carmel.
Carmel, 11:00 p. m.
Monday, the 21st.
Oh, darling.
This was to be so quick and final.
Sheila...
All in that one moment in Matt's room.
David, what are we going to do?
Wait.
For what?
He must be after something or he would have gone to the police.
But how can anyone know?
No one can.
A sick man dies in his sleep.
The death certificate says natural causes.
Unless he found out about us and put two and two together.
But if he's guessing, why did he write what he did?
To test us.
Then he sits back to watch for a reaction.
We may have given ourselves away already.
Sympathy letters you didn't open, an operation I couldn't go through with.
He may even have followed you here.
But I told you I was careful.
How?
Switching taxis?
How do you think that'd look to anyone who was watching you?
But no one was watching.
I'm sure of that.
We still shouldn't have taken a chance.
You don't want to see me?
Come on, now.
Don't be...
You don't want to see me at all?
Don't be ridiculous.
Oh, darling.
Oh, my darling.
I'm sorry.
What's happening to us?
Darling...
David, it's all my fault.
No.
I should have let you go away.
Quarter to 7:00, folks.
Park closes in 15 minutes.
Yeah, thanks.
Look, I'm shaking.
Well, don't worry.
He won't come out of the dark like that.
He'll wait, he'll watch, he'll make sure he's right.
That's our one hope, Sheila.
Hope?
Sometime, somehow, he's got to give himself away.
It'll be in his attitude, something he says.
We're looking for it, we'll find it.
And when we do?
Well, it depends on who it is and how dangerous.
What do you mean?
Well, you can trap a fox.
A wolf has to be killed.
Oh, no.
Good evening.
I'm looking for Miss Cabot.
Oh, yes.
Right this way, ma'am.
Good evening, Cathy.
Hello.
What is this?
Some sort of joke?
I asked her to come, Blake.
Please sit down, Miss Lee.
I don't blame you for feeling the way you do, Mr. Richards, but I had to lie the other day.
She'd have lost her job.
You know that.
Sometimes you can lose more than a job.
I know.
That's why I wanted to make it up to you if I could.
Did you find a copy of the agreement?
No.
Mr. Mason destroyed it and the carbons.
But I brought something else that might interest you, Mr. Richards.
Well, what are these?
They go back quite a number of years when Mr. Cabot was in Hong Kong and Mr. Mason was running the office.
These are about my father.
They won't bring him back, Mr. Richards, but I just couldn't let you go on blaming Matt Cabot for destroying him.
When your father was alive, Cathy, I got to...
You get to know a person very well in 20 years.
I'll miss him very much.
Looks like I've said a lot of things I shouldn't have.
That's not important now, Blake.
It's all forgotten.
No, it isn't, Cathy.
Not all.
Hey, Petey-boy!
Hi, Cobb.
Come here.
Say, how about finishing that story about the race at Indianapolis?
Which one was that?
You know.
You were beating Barney Oldfield by a whole lap, and the wheel came off in your hands.
Oh, that one.
Sure.
Say, you know, a funny thing happened just now.
I was sitting in my room, minding my own business, when suddenly I saw the postman go by.
So, naturally, out I came to pick up the mail, and what do you think?
What?
It was gone.
Stolen?
I don't know.
Gosh!
That's a federal offense.
Right.
Now, who do you suppose would dare tamper with the United States Mail?
Me.
You?
Well, in that case, I don't suppose we can prosecute.
I took them all up to Mother.
Fooled you, didn't I, Cobb?
You surehad me there.
And tell me, did you read the mail to your mother like you sometimes do?
Nope.
Today she read them herself.
Did she seem upset or anything?
Don't think so.
Peter, lunch is ready.
Lunch already?
Come along, now.
Better do what the heavenly princess says.
What was Cobb talking about just now?
Nothing.
He just asked me about the mail.
Hi, Mommy.
Where're you going?
To the doctor's office, but only for a little while.
You have your lunch now.
Gosh, Mom!
I can still taste my breakfast.
Oh, Peter!
Go on.
Tawny.
Yes, Mrs. Cabot?
Is there anything bothering you?
Bothering me?
Well, these past few days you've been acting rather strangely.
In what way?
I feel you've been deliberately avoiding me.
No, of course not, Mrs. Cabot.
I'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
Peter's getting careless with his toys.
I'll just leave this inside where the weather can't get at it.
Mrs. Cabot?
Yes?
I was wondering if I could ask you something of a personal nature.
Personal?
Personal to me, that is.
What is it, Cobb?
Well, not to put too fine a point on it, ma'am,
I was wondering if you could let me have an advance on my salary.
But I've already paid you several months ahead.
So you have.
You've been most generous, ma'am.
But if you could see your way clear to letting me have my salary for...
Let's see now...
That would bring us to next March, wouldn't it?
What do you want it for, Cobb?
Oh, horses, women, champagne.
Don't worry, ma'am, I won't be wasting it.
Confidentially, I'm being pressed by certain creditors.
They're putting the heat on, to state it bluntly.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll think about it.
Thank you, ma'am.
It's a little uncomfortable walking around with that kind of a threat hanging over you.
Well, did you tell him you'd give him the money?
I said I'd consider it.
You shouldn't have!
Next time it could be more than salary he wants.
No, David, not Cobb.
Look at all the chances he's had to spy on us.
Chauffeuring you downtown two or three times a week.
He's in debt, that's all.
He gambles every cent he makes.
Was he off on the 21st?
That was a Monday, wasn't it?
Yes.
No, no, he couldn't have been.
Is there any way he could've driven to Carmel that night?
Well, not without my knowing about it.
Well, are you sure?
It's no use, David.
Everything I see seems suspicious, every person, every action, every word.
I know, I know.
Oh, Sheila.
Yes'?
Excuse me, Doctor.
I told you I wasn't to be interrupted.
I know, Doctor, but there's a phone call for Mrs. Cabot.
The gentleman says it's urgent.
A Mr. Mason.
Howard Mason.
How does he know you're here?
I don't know.
Miss Bell, will you please put Mr. Mason through?
But why?
Talk to him.
But, David, I don't see why...
We've got to find out what he wants.
Be careful.
Hello.
Sheila.
I didn't mean to interrupt your consultation.
I was just wondering if you'd stop by the office while you're downtown.
How did you know I was here, Howard?
Tawny told me.
Did she betray a confidence?
Well, no, of course not.
I was a little concerned about you.
I understand the doctor came up to the house yesterday.
Today you're returning his call.
I had no idea that you were that ill.
Well, it's nothing serious.
Just emotional strain, David says.
Well, I'm sure we can depend on David's judgment.
What did you want to see me about?
There's a meeting of the Association Thursday night.
I'll need your proxy.
Well, I'll be through here shortly.
I'll stop by.
Good.
Well, I'll let you two get back to more clinical matters.
Goodbye, Howard.
Goodbye.
He knows you're not here for medical advice.
That's absurd.
He couldn't possibly know.
Did you hear the way he picked up the name David?
Sheila, I wonder...
Sheila, do you suppose it's Mason that...
Howard?
Blackmail?
That's incredible.
He has more money now than he can spend.
Maybe it's not money he's after.
Well, what else could it be?
I'm sure that...
What is it?
Nothing.
Sheila.
Sheila, what is it he wants?
He says he's in love with me.
He asked me to marry him.
When?
Yesterday.
Why didn't you tell me?
'Cause I was afraid you wouldn't understand.
I'm beginning to understand.
After all, a man doesn't propose to a blank wall.
You see?
That's why I didn't tell you.
He's known you a lot longer than I have.
David, I love you!
Did you tell him that?
How could I?
How could I?
He seems to know all about me.
Well, he can't.
He's been talking to Dr. Kessler.
Asking a lot of questions, for all I know.
Dr. Kessler?
Yeah, playing golf.
Why is he spending so much time with Matt's former doctor?
But that means nothing.
They've been playing Pebble Beach on Mondays for years.
Pebble Beach?
Well, why do you say it like that?
Sheila, when was that letter mailed?
On the 21st.
Monday.
Pebble Beach is only six miles from Carmel.
Howard Mason?
Howard Mason.
Sheila, don't go to the office.
You go home and call him.
Tell him you don't feel well.
Tell him to pick up the proxy at your house the night of the meeting.
David, what are you thinking?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
No, darling...
Sheila, Mason is more dangerous than a fox.
Tonight is the deadline for the negotiations between the Longshoremefis Union and the Shipping Association.
Both sides have made their final offers, and unless one of them is prepared to make concessions, which is highly unlikely in view of their published statements...
Well, it looks pretty good.
After midnight, don't bother to challenge anyone.
Hit them first.
I'll ask the questions afterwards.
Okay.
Hey, Sid.
Better get on up there.
Back in '29 a mob of them come up in rowboats.
I still got the scar.
You better send a launch out, with a couple of rifles aboard.
Larry!
Get out on the Janie D!
Take a couple of boys with you!
Okay!
I'll be at the Cabot home if you need me.
8:30 at the Shipping Association.
Right.
Cabot residence.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
I'll tell Mrs. Cabot.
Tawny, who was that?
It was Mr. Mason.
He'll be here in 20 minutes.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
Good night.
Good night, Mrs. Cabot.
I thought all the servants were going to be off.
She's going now.
The others have left.
What about Cathy?
She's having dinner with Blake Richards.
Good.
Now, remember, the instant Mason's car pulls away from the curb, you go...
David.
What's the matter?
I'm frightened.
Are you sure?
Are you sure we have to...
Sheila, he could lift a telephone and send us to the gas chamber.
I know that, but...
We have no choice.
But only one block from here.
Won't somebody suspect?
On the night of a strike vote, they won't look beyond the waterfront.
Darling, everything depends on your signal.
Now, the second his car pulls away, you draw the curtains open
so that I can see the light from the top of the hill.
Now remember, when the car pulls away from the curb, not one moment sooner or later, you draw the curtains open.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Are you all right?
I love you, David.
I love you.
Hi, Cathy.
Hi.
Is that how you're taking me out to dinner?
Is it 8:00 already?
If I'd known we were going to a beatnik joint for coffee and word-jazz,
I'd have worn my black tights.
Well, I'm sorry, honey, but Rosie and I are gonna be stuck here for a while.
You look beautiful, too.
Gee, it's a shame to waste that outfit.
Well, that helps a little.
I've got to get this tub back in shape.
The way things are at the bank, every penny adds up.
Well, I forgive you this time.
I'll tell you what.
We ought to be through in a couple of hours.
Why don't you go on home and get a bite and I'll call you?
Looks like coffee and word-jazz after all, huh?
Could be.
But skip the black tights.
You'll be sorry.
Listen, kid.
Save it, Rosie.
I hope you know what you're doing.
I know what I'm doing.
It's perfectly beautiful, Howard.
Here, let me.
You've been spoiling me these past few days.
I enjoy it.
Would you like a brandy?
Love one.
Howard, I've been worried about you.
About me?
Why?
The radio says that there might be violence at the waterfront.
It's been known to happen during a strike.
Why don't you call an agency and hire a bodyguard or something?
I've already taken care of it.
How?
I got me a private eye.
Trench coat and all.
I think that's very wise of you.
Thank you.
I'm flattered about your concern.
Well, I do need someone to run things for me.
Is that all?
For the present.
To the future.
I'd better be going.
Did you sign that proxy, Sheila?
Yes, it's right over here.
About that bodyguard, I hope he's trustworthy.
Hasn't lost a client yet.
Good.
Is he with you now?
No.
I'm picking him up at the meeting.
You know, he's gonna play merry hell with my most intimate moments.
Will we see you tomorrow night?
Dinner, perhaps?
Skyway Inn?
It sounds wonderful.
Good night.
Good night, Howard.
David.
Lock the door.
What happened?
Somebody took a shot at me.
I need a drink.
Did...
Did you see who it was?
No, he was in a car parked at the corner.
It's a lucky thing that light turned green when it did.
If I'd stopped...
As it is, that bullet only missed me by inches.
But who could it have been?
Someone from the waterfront?
Well, we'll soon know.
How?
I saw his license number.
His license?
I only got a glimpse of it as he drove away.
L-B something and then...
And something 4-0.
It's not much, but it's a lead for the police.
Get them on the phone, Sheila.
Howard, before we call them, are you sure we ought to?
What are you talking about?
Well, you're alive, that's all that matters.
You know what the police would mean, reporters and headlines, and it mightn't be good for the Cabot Line.
Look, I can't help that.
If he'd try it once, he could try again.
Here, I'll do it.
Hello?
Oh, yes, Cathy.
I'm so glad you called.
Something awful has happened.
Howard is here, and someone tried to kill him.
What does he know?
Can you talk?
No, no, he's all right.
He's right beside me.
We were just going to call the police.
He saw the license number of the car.
I see.
Don't let him phone.
Keep him there.
Yes.
That's a very good idea.
What's a very good idea?
She's right next to the police station.
She's going there now.
Yes.
But hurry.
They should be here in a few minutes.
Good.
Where are you going?
To make sure I locked the door.
It's all right.
When you came in I was so startled...
I wonder if I ought to call the Shipping Association, let them know.
Well, maybe you should wait until the police get here.
They may not want you to say anything to anyone.
You're probably right.
It was really foolish of you to wait so long to get a bodyguard.
Well, I never dreamed they'd go this far.
Sorry.
It's a delayed reaction, I guess.
You could do with another drink.
Yes, I could.
Well, what's keeping them?
It's only been a minute.
Police.
If I'd gone through a red light, there'd have been a squad car at that corner.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Who?
Hello.
Who's this?
Howard?
Didn't you have a meeting or something?
Well, yes, I did.
But I was delayed.
Well, look, would you mind telling Sheila that if Blake Richards calls,
I'm here at the yacht club having dinner and that he's to pick me up here.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Good night, Cathy.
Poor Cathy!
All of a sudden her memory's gone to pieces.
She seems to have forgotten about the police entirely.
But that's impossible.
She's having dinner at the yacht club.
She wanted Blake Richards to pick her up there if he called.
But I don't see how she could have said a thing like that...
Who called the first time?
Well, Cathy, of course.
There's some mistake.
Why are you lying?
I'm not.
Why didn't you want the police here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're trying to confuse me.
I'll tell you why.
Because you knew the man in the car was waiting for me.
How could I have known that?
You sent him there!
No.
No, I didn't!
I didn't think you'd be fool enough to try to kill me for what I suspected.
Who was in the car?
I don't know!
Who was it?
Don't!
My arm.
Shall I get a doctor?
How about your friend Rivera?
Of course, maybe he's not in his office right now.
Maybe he's sitting somewhere in a car with a gun.
Or maybe he's in a phone booth.
It was Rivera who called, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
Yes.
You told him to come here!
And then you went to unlock the door.
Well, he's not going to find me here.
Or you.
Get your coat.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Go to him.
Stay there, darling.
I'm coming right up.
What is it, darling?
I heard a noise.
It woke me up.
I was frightened.
Oh, you mustn't be frightened.
It was just a bad dream.
That's all.
I wouldn't let anything happen to you.
Boy, it sure was loud for a dream.
Like on Wagon Train.
Well, everything's all right now.
Come on, you go to bed.
Mommy, could I go to sleep in your room tonight?
All right, dear.
In you go.
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, baby.
Sheila.
Where is he?
Get your coat.
But darling...
I have to get rid of the car.
Hurry!
Wait.
We'll go along the Coast Highway.
I'll drive his car.
You take mine and follow me.
David, I can't drive.
You've got to.
I have to have a way to get back.
But I can't.
I just can't.
Sheila, you've got to!
There's no other way.
Come on!
David, I can't!
Go on, get in.
Get in.
Now, look, Sheila, here's all you have to do.
Now you step on the brake, here, you release the emergency.
You push this button, D.
This pedal makes the car go...
This one makes it stop.
All you have to do is steer it.
Sheila, the car practically drives itself.
Now, can you remember all that?
I'll try.
You keep my rear lights in view.
Don't let them out of your sight for a second.
But David...
Sheila...
Sheila, you can do it.
Go on!
Move along!
Sheila!
Sheila!
Quiet, honey.
Quiet.
Quiet, baby.
No wonder Cabot was able to break my father.
He wouldn't fight like that!
But I will.
I'm not through with you yet!
Is that what you'd call an idle threat?
No, I meant it.
Meant to kill him?
No, just change his looks a little.
Now, look, son.
Miss Cabot says you broke a dinner date to work on your tug.
But the night watchman on the dock says you drove off a few minutes after she left.
Now you say...
And I'll say it again.
I was waiting for him outside the Shipping Association.
But he never showed.
Anybody see you there?
When you're gonna push somebody's face in, you don't stand under a street light.
I was next door in a parking lot.
Convenient.
Are you sure you didn't jump him in his car, drive him down Highway One and then nudge him over into Half Moon Bay?
With a little lead in him for ballast?
It wouldn't have been a bad idea.
I just never thought of it.
You're not sorry he was killed.
You admit that.
What do you want me to do?
Send him a get-well card?
Look, it's all there in that file.
The whole blueprint for squeezing my father out of the shipping business, step-by-step, nice and legal and dirty.
And signed by Howard Mason.
How would you feel about the man who wrecked your father and left him sucking exhaust fumes in a locked garage?
How I feel's got nothing to do with it.
Okay!
I hated his guts!
But I didn't kill him!
Why not make it easy on yourself and tell the truth?
That is the truth!
Okay.
You'd better cool off for an hour.
Maybe that'll help your memory.
Come on, son.
Blake.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
My car is downstairs.
I'll drive you back.
I think you'd better run along, Cathy.
Is there anything I can do, Blake?
Shall I get one of the Cabot lawyers?
Don't bother, honey.
Their hearts wouldn't be in it.
Hi, Peter.
Hi, Cath.
Aren't you cold?
No.
Guess what?
Some police are here asking Mommy questions about Mr. Mason.
That's their job, darling, to ask questions.
I wish I could ask somebody some questions.
What?
About this dream I had last night.
You want to hear about it?
Not now, Peter.
Do you know if Mr. Mason had any relatives in San Francisco?
No.
Did Mr. Mason say anything to you that suggested his life might be in danger?
Well, he did tell me that he had hired a bodyguard.
Can you think of anyone else who knew he was coming here to the house last night?
No, but he had no reason to keep it a secret.
He came to pick up my proxy for the meeting.
Yes, I know.
We found it in his pocket.
Peter, darling, I told you...
Really, you shouldn't be here.
Gee, Mom.
Will you please do as I ask and go outside and play?
Okay.
Say, do you know Peter Gunn?
I'm afraid not, sonny.
Some detective.
Doesn't know Peter Gunn.
Even Cobb knows him, he says.
But I've given you all I can right now.
You have to give me a little more time.
Hey, Cobb.
Hold on a second.
You mind, Petey-boy?
Important business.
I can wait.
There's something I gotta ask you.
Well, later.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll get the money in a day or two.
Give me a break, will you?
What time did Mr. Mason leave here, do you remember?
Yes, 8:15.
Any particular reason why you should notice the time, Mrs. Cabot?
Well, he looked at his watch and said that he had to give himself 15 minutes to get downtown.
To the Shipping Association?
Yes.
But Sheila...
Yes, Miss Cabot?
It was later than that when I spoke to him.
You spoke to him here?
Yes, on the phone.
What time?
I don't know exactly.
I know it was a little later because I was expecting a call from Blake...
Blake Richards?
Yes.
Yes, he was busy last night, I believe.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I forgot Cathy's call.
Was it important?
Well, five or 10 minutes wouldn't have made much difference, except to the man who was waiting for him.
You got time now, Cathy?
No.
I'm sorry, Peter.
All right.
What's on your mind?
Can dreams ever really happen?
I mean, if they're real bad, can you wake up and find they're true?
No, darling.
A dream's gone the minute you open your eyes.
Boy, that's a relief.
Why, did you have a nightmare?
Last night.
It was about Mommy and Mr. Mason who got himself killed.
He was yelling at her downstairs.
It woke me up.
What was he saying?
I couldn't tell.
But then I heard a shot.
Boy, was it loud.
After you woke up?
I thought so.
But then I called Mommy, and she came upstairs and said it was only a dream.
I got to sleep in her room.
Boy, was I scared.
I still am.
There's nothing to be afraid of, Peter.
Dreams can't hurt you.
I guess not.
Hey, Rajah!
Come back here!
Tawny.
Did you hear anything unusual last night?
Unusual?
Like a loud noise, for example, that might have awakened Peter.
No.
I wasn't here last night.
Weren't you off the day before?
Yes.
But Mrs. Cabot was kind enough to suggest I take last night, too.
Then there was no one in the house?
Only Mrs. Cabot and Peter.
I see.
Why do you ask?
It's nothing.
Doctor Rivera...
Oh, David.
David, this is Cathy.
Yes.
May I come to see you now?
Yes, it's terribly important.
Well, now, Cathy, just what is it that's so important?
David, I need your help.
There was no one else that I could turn to.
Don't worry.
I'll do anything I can.
I know who killed Howard Mason.
You what?
What should I do?
Who do you think it is?
It's Sheila.
Sheila?
Cathy...
Cathy, do you realize what you're saying?
It's true.
I'm sure of it.
Well, how do you know?
Well, everything, it all adds up.
Sheila arranged for all the servants to be off last night.
That's never happened before.
Cathy, now surely...
Wait, David!
That isn't all.
I spoke to Howard myself on the phone at the house after Sheila told the police that he'd left.
For heaven's sake, Cathy.
If that's all there is to it...
David, wait.
Listen to me.
Peter was awakened by a shot.
A shot, David.
Sheila told him it was a bad dream.
It wasn't a dream.
David, it was a shot that he heard.
Cathy, there was a bullet hole in the window of Mason's car.
How can you believe they killed him in the house?
They?
You said "They," David.
What difference does it make?
She, they, whoever it was.
Why did you say "They," David?
Just to try to make sense out of what you're saying.
Now, how could a woman by herself drag a body from the house to the car and dispose of it and the car without help?
She couldn't.
Now you're accusing two people.
Who do you suppose the other person was?
Cobb?
Tawny?
Peter in a dream.
I know who it was.
You do?
It was her lover.
Sheila?
Sheila with a lover?
Oh, Cathy.
It must have been!
David, I've suspected it for months.
All those shopping trips with no packages brought home, nothing delivered!
She was meeting someone.
He must have been the one who helped her.
For heaven's sake.
What reason could she possibly have for wanting to kill Mason?
She hated him.
It was almost as though she were afraid of him.
Afraid of what?
He must have found out about the other man.
Howard was like that.
Well, he found out about Blake and me.
These wild, fantastic guesses!
Cathy!
Cathy!
It's insane!
Oh, no, David, it isn't.
Please, help me.
Help you what?
Spin a few scraps of unrelated nonsense into a web to implicate your mother in a murder?
She's not my mother.
No, no, no, of course she's not!
She's the woman who replaced your mother, and that's something you've never forgiven her for, isn't it, Cathy?
That's why you're so eager to believe she's guilty of adultery, murder, anything.
No.
No.
You're trying to protect the person who deep down you're afraid did kill Mason.
No, David.
You'll twist the facts.
You'll believe anything to convince yourself that Sheila is guilty, because that'll prove that Blake Richards isn't.
And that's what you really want to believe, isn't it?
Blake couldn't have done it!
Why...
The police are still holding him.
He threatened Mason.
Even he doesn't deny that.
I don't care!
I know Blake didn't do it!
You know!
Just as you know that Sheila and some unknown lover did!
But it all seemed to fit together.
No, no, no, not all!
You still haven't told me how they took the body from the house to Half Moon Bay.
Did they go together in one car?
How did they get back?
Did they hitchhike, or hail a taxi?
Maybe they had two cars.
Of course.
There had to be two cars.
Even you can see that.
Two cars traveling together 25 miles over a treacherous road.
Maybe that's what they did.
Cathy, Sheila doesn't drive.
Come on.
Go home, Cathy.
You see?
Peter isn't the only one who had a bad dream.
David.
What?
Cathy!
I swear by Apollo, the physician, by Hygeia, Panacea, and all the gods and goddesses, that according to my ability and judgment,
I will keep this oath and stipulation to reckon him who teaches me this art equally dear with my parents.
I will follow that system of regimen which I consider best for my patients and abstain from whatever is injurious with purity and holiness while I pass my life and practice my art.
Into whatever houses I enter,
I will go for the advantage of the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption.
I swear I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest such counsel.
While I continue to keep this oath inviolate, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of my art, respected always by all men, but should I break and violate this oath, may the opposite be my lot.
You can't go away, not now.
It's the only thing I can do.
But on the phone you said that you had convinced Cathy that she was wrong.
Yes, but look at us right now.
Every minute we're together we start to...
Sheila, our nerves are in shreds.
It can only get worse.
We're bound to give ourselves away.
Where will you go?
Zurich?
No, not anymore.
I resigned from the hospital.
I'm giving up my practice.
David, you can't.
Look, it's done.
Let's not talk about it.
Well, what will you do?
I don't know.
Go somewhere and try to put the pieces back together.
Sheila...
Sheila, we'll find each other again.
As soon as this has died down...
Darling...
Darling, I'll send for you.
But you see, right now...
All right, David.
Whatever you say.
Stop running!
Mommy.
Cobb just drove back from Seal Rock in 12-and-a-half minutes!
Boy, I bet that's a world's record!
I'm sure it is.
Peter, you mustn't disturb your mother and Dr. Rivera.
I'm not disturbing them.
I'm just talking to them.
You're right, Peter.
When Cobb breaks a record, people should hear about it.
Don't you have something for your mother?
Oh, yeah.
It was in the mail box.
I must have missed it this morning.
I'll read it to you, Mommy.
Well...
Please?
This one's easy.
It's printed.
"Dear Mrs. Cabot,
"my congratulations on the success of your second venture."
Thank you, darling.
What does "venture" mean, Mommy?
Come along, Peter.
Well, what does it mean, Tawny?
I am sorry that I had to break in on your evening, Mr. Corbin.
I'm glad to be of service, Miss Cabot.
Shall I drive you home?
No, we'll be all right.
But thank you.
It's a pleasure.
Good luck, Mr. Richards.
Thank you, sir.
Good night.
Good night.
Free air.
I never knew you could actually taste it.
Drink in all you can.
It's the end of the supply.
That sounds like a threat.
It is.
You're getting married.
Anybody I know?
Funny.
When's all this supposed to happen?
As soon as the law allows.
Let's go in and ask them.
That's why we're getting married, mister.
So I can keep you out of places like this.
Okay.
Come on home, and I'll get cleaned up and then I'll take you out for a wedding breakfast, champagne and all.
Breakfast?
We're not married yet.
Now, look, honey, if you're gonna stand on ceremony, then the whole deal's off.
Have some coffee, darling.
I can't.
Well, you really should have something.
Stop pretending we're normal people.
In front of others we have to, but when we're alone let's not kid each other.
Look at that letter.
No stamp, no postmark.
Whoever wrote it is close enough to drop it in your mailbox in broad daylight.
Sheila.
What is it?
Have you fired Cobb?
No.
Why?
Look.
Get him up here.
No, David.
No, we can't.
Do as I say.
Tell him you want him.
Don't let him know he was seen.
Yes?
Of course, ma'am.
I'll just pop into my jacket and I'll be up in ajiffy.
David, we can't get involved in any more killing.
We have to find out.
What else can we do?
We've gone too far to turn back now.
Listen to me, darling.
If he were going to expose us, he would have gone to the police already.
So it could only be money that he's after.
As long as we satisfy him, he'll be quiet.
Do you know what it means to sit and wait for a blackmailer?
We'd be together.
Sure, sure.
One day at a time.
That's more than we've ever had.
Then one day he writes his final letter, to the police.
Here he comes.
Darling, promise me you won't do anything until we're certain.
Until we've decided together.
Good evening, ma'am.
Doctor.
No sickness in the house, I hope.
Nothing serious, Cobb.
Cobb, were you leaving just now?
Leaving, ma'am?
Why would I do that?
Weren't you putting some suitcases in the car?
Oh, yes, the suitcases.
And that usually does indicate a trip, doesn't it?
Were you intending to take the car as well?
No, ma'am, only as far as the bus station.
Then you were leaving.
Mrs. Cabot, I'm going to throw myself on your mercy.
The truth of the matter is that the money you gave me to pay the Central Garage last month went to pay my bookmaker.
It's fearful how many horses lately have proved unreliable.
You should be getting a hot letter from the garage about the money any day.
So, I figured I'd better skip and save you the embarrassment.
There's no reason for that, Cobb.
I'm sure Mrs. Cabot could arrange for you to work off the amount.
Maybe she still can.
I'm afraid that's no longer possible, Doctor.
Why not?
Well, you see, besides the money I owe Mrs. Cabot, which I intend to pay back, there's still quite a bundle I owe the bookmakers.
And if I stayed, I might be picked up in a dark alley one night.
It's a prospect that's been disturbing my slumber.
All things considered, ma'am,
I'd appreciate it if you would regard this as my resignation.
Oh, Cobb...
Yes, Doctor?
On the 21st, the night of Mr. Cabofs funeral, did you happen to use the car?
Well, I...
Without Mrs. Cabot's permission?
No indeed, sir.
Where were you that night?
Do you remember?
Yes, sir.
In my room.
Couple of hours of TV, then to bed.
I see.
And tonight, where were you heading?
South.
That's still my plan, Doctor.
I feel I could do well in Los Angeles.
I suppose it would be a bit unrealistic to hope that you would write me a reference?
Well, I really don't see how I...
Emphasizing my skill at the wheel and skimming lightly over my moral character?
I think Cobb has learned his lesson, Mrs. Cabot.
You have my word on it, ma'am.
Very well.
Mighty decent of you to help, Doctor.
Thank you.
It's all right, it's all right.
Look, I have some friends in Los Angeles.
One of them might be looking for a good driver.
Would you be interested?
Indeed I would.
Fine.
Well...
Here, write your name and where you'll be staying.
I'll let you know.
Thank you, Doctor.
I won't forget you for this.
All right.
Just to make sure it's legible, maybe you'd better print it.
Print it?
Surely.
It...
It just occurs to me, Doctor, I have no place to call my own.
I'll send it along later, if that's all right with you?
Fine, fine.
I'm sure an expert driver like yourself won't have any trouble finding a job.
Tell your friends, never an accident in 12 years at the wheel.
And not just loafing along, mind you.
Wasn't a car on the road could pass me if I didn't want him to.
So I've heard from Peter.
Well, that's youngsters for you.
The faster I went, the better Petey liked it.
I remember he said you made it from the cemetery to the garage, that's the day of the funeral, in 20 minutes?
Being a boy, he's inclined to exaggerate.
Twenty-two minutes.
Well, that's good enough.
Fair.
And that night, two hours and 10 minutes, back from Carmel?
Two hours even.
You lied about that night.
I was only...
You were in Carmel.
Yes, but...
You mailed a letter!
No.
You're lying!
No, I'm not lying!
I want the truth!
That is the truth!
You did mail a letter, didn't you?
No, sir!
David, don't.
What were you doing there?
My regular job, chauffeuring!
Then you drove someone, huh?
Yes!
But...
Who was it?
I promised...
Who was it?
For God's sake, Doctor.
David!
Who did you drive to Carmel?
It was...
It was Mrs. Cabot!
Sheila...
It's impossible.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cabot.
Get out, Cobb.
He forced it out of me.
David, I wrote those letters, but because I...
Sheila...
It isn't possible.
I wanted to tell you a thousand times.
And I was going to as soon as we...
David, look at me.
In God's name, what possessed you?
I felt I was losing you, and I had to find some way to keep you with me.
Losing me?
After the way Matt died?
But you had changed.
You avoided me.
You kept making excuses.
Poor Howard Mason.
An innocent round of golf at Pebble Beach.
No.
No, he knew about us.
He practically said so.
David, I tried to stop it!
Honest, ltried, but...
He would've destroyed us.
You didn't know him.
But this last letter.
But you were going away.
Last night when you phoned about Cathy,
I could hear it in your voice.
I wouldn't have let Peter open that letter if I could have made you stay.
I'd have torn it up, I swear it.
All I wanted was to be with you.
But I told you I'd send for you.
No, David.
No, you wouldn't.
You'd have forgotten about everything, everything except Matt.
A car going over a cliff...
And everything that's happened to you from the day you met me.
David, don't go away from me.
Don't hate me.
Hate you?
How can I?
You're all I have left.
I've killed twice,
I'd kill again.
God help me.
My darling!
My darling!
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
It's all behind us now.
We'll go away.
That's what we'll do.
We'll make a new life together, somewhere, somehow.
If only we could!
We can, darling.
We can.
Nobody knows about Mason, or about Matt.
Or about us.
We're free, Sheila.
We're free.
Nobody knows.
Nobody.
Cathy.
David!
Cathy, put down the phone.
Don't call anybody.
Cathy.
Cathy, wait.
Please, just listen to me.
Please!
Don't run away.
Please, Cathy.
Oh, Cathy, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Oh, Cathy.
Cathy, you're my friend.
You've got to understand.
You see...
You see, Mason had to be killed.
Cathy!
Wait, Cathy!
Cathy, you're so young.
You don't realize what love is.
You see...
You see, Sheila and I...
Well, we love each other.
Some day you'll know what that means.
Please.
We had to do what we did.
David!
It's no use.
I've got to make her understand.
Cathy!
Cathy!
Cathy!
Cathy!
Cathy!
Cathy!
Blake!
Blake!
Blake!
Cathy, don't!
Cathy!
Cathy.
Cathy, please.
Please come back.
Cathy.
Cathy, please.
Cathy.
Give me your hand.
Cathy.
Please.
Blake!
Please come back!
Cathy!
Blake!
Please, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Cathy.
Cathy.
Cathy!
Cathy...
David!
David, don't!
No!
Oh, Sheila!
( noirish jazz theme playing )
( uneasy theme playing )
I'll put it to you bluntly, mayor.
Ever since the death of Roger Pearson, the governor has been looking for a replacement.
To head up the crime commission?
That's right.
Well, that's a very responsible job.
Sure it is.
Oh, thank you.
That's why the governor hasn't made the appointment yet.
Now it's come down to two men.
You mean I'm one of them?
That's right.
Arnold Webberly's the other.
He's a fine man.
A great attorney.
Yes, he is.
I understand you're friends.
Yes.
Good friends.
Although most of his legal practice is in Los Angeles, he still lives here in town.
Of course, he has the advantage of being free to take the job.
I'm still mayor here in Upton.
Well, your term is up this year, Jim.
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
MAN:
The job would wait.
Of course, I'm only the governor's birddog to sound you out.
The governor still has to make the decision.
But he wants to know if you're interested, Henderson.
What do you say?
It's up to you, Jim.
You know I wouldn't interfere.
But it is a big step up, isn't it, Mr. Carter?
A big step.
Yes, yes, I'm interested.
Good.
Good.
Now, why don't you come along with me?
We'll talk this thing out.
Very well.
The governor wants to attack the narcotics problem, juvenile delinquency.
JIM:
I'll be very happy to talk with the governor.
( suspenseful theme playing )
It's been a great pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Henderson.
We think a great deal of your husband in Sacramento.
Thank you.
We think a great deal of him here in Upton too.
( chuckles )
(car starts )
Tom?
Our deal's off.
Something's come up.
I'm sorry.
I can't afford to take any chances now.
My husband's career is at stake.
( telephone ringing )
( tense theme playing )
( ringing continues )
Yes, Tom?
Mona, I don't know what you're up to now, but you can't pull out on me,
I won't stand still for it.
I've got more than 70,000 dollars tied up in options.
I'll have to make it up to you in some other way.
We're going ahead.
Just as soon as the information I need reaches the mayor's office, you're going to pass it on to me as per our agreement.
Or I go right to the newspapers and dump the whole thing on their front pages.
Make up your mind, Mona.
All right.
But you haven't even paid me for what I've done so far.
I've got it, 10,000 waiting for you.
No.
I can't come to you.
I'll have to arrange something.
Let me see--
The Highway Hotel on 101.
After you register in your room, wait for me there.
Or I may send Jim's secretary, Susan Connolly.
I've have to be very careful, Tom.
All right.
What time?
Well, um...
Make it about half past 1.
( suspenseful theme playing )
MRS. HENDERSON:
I know it's an imposition,
Susan, but when I told Jim I'd do the errand for him,
I completely forgot I promised I'd be at the club and on the first tee by 1.
Well, it's no imposition at all, Mrs. Henderson.
I'm glad to help.
I'll explain to Mr. Henderson.
You said the Highway Hotel on 101.
Yes, that's right.
Mr. Stratton will be waiting for you in the lobby.
He'll give you an envelope for me and that's all there is to it.
I think it's wonderful news about Mr. Henderson.
Yes, it is.
Even if he doesn't get the appointment.
But he will.
I only wish there was something
I could do to help.
Oh, you've been a tremendous help,
Susan, just being his secretary.
And you are helping out, right now.
( tense theme playing )
Highway Hotel.
One moment, please.
Yes, ma'am, may I help you?
Yes, I was supposed to meet a Mr. Stratton here.
Would you have him paged for me please?
Are you Miss Connolly?
Yes.
A message was left to have you meet Mr. Stratton in his room.
Room 204.
Thank you.
( dramatic theme playing )
Are you Susan Connolly?
Yes, sir.
You'd better sign this receipt, Miss Connolly.
All right.
Right there.
Ten thousand dollars.
Didn't you know what you were picking up?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
You better count it, Miss Connolly.
I wouldn't want any misunderstandings.
( dramatic theme playing )
MAN:
Well, here it is.
You never saw two more surprised people.
Who are they, anyway?
Never mind.
Whoops.
You did say 100 dollars.
That's right.
One hundred dollars.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What are you going to do with the photograph anyway?
Oh, that 100 dollars answers all questions, Frank.
I have one question
I've been meaning to ask you for a long time.
And I've had one answer
I've been meaning to tell you for a long time.
I don't know how you mean that.
Now you know.
( closes door )
What did you do after the photograph was taken?
Nothing.
I was bewildered.
I still don't understand what it's all about.
Did you take the money?
No.
What about the receipt you signed?
Oh, no.
Mr. Stratton has it.
Not very smart, Miss Connolly.
But I was confused.
I didn't know what I was doing.
What did you do after you left the hotel room?
I went back to the office.
I tried to reach Mr. Henderson and couldn't, he was with Mr. Carter somewhere.
Then I tried to get in touch with Mrs. Henderson.
You said she told you she had a golf date.
I called the club, the starter said she didn't keep her appointment.
Then I just couldn't stand it any more, Mr. Mason.
I came here to you, for help.
Do you know of any connection between Mrs. Henderson and this Thomas Stratton?
No, I--
I didn't even know who he was until I looked him up.
What'd you found out?
Just that he's a real estate dealer.
You mentioned Henderson was seeing a man by the name of Carter.
Yes, well, that's another thing.
Mr. Henderson's up for an appointment to head the governor's new crime commission.
And if a word of scandal or anything unethical were to be connected with him it would--
It would hurt.
Yes.
And you wouldn't want that.
No.
Of course not.
Other than what you told me, did Stratton give you any clue to all of this?
Well, he did say a very curious thing.
He said, "I wonder what else
Mona Henderson has to cover up?"
Julia, oh, you must know about, uh, the governor's appointment by now.
Mm-hm.
Makes us sort of competitors after all these years.
Oh, this is the putter that won you the Reno Woman's Open, isn't it?
Mm-hm.
Oh, you played splendidly.
I remember when you went to Reno for the tournament.
Or was it for the tournament?
What do you mean?
Oh, I remember how positively brilliant Arnold was as the attorney in the Brigham-Putnam civil case, that was right around the time you went for tournament, wasn't it, Julia?
Well, yes, but...
That was his biggest case, put him right in the big league.
"Noted lawyer unearths surprise witness."
What are you getting at?
The surprise witness' name was Buonanova.
A striking-looking man, hunchback, if I recall.
Mona--
Isn't it odd he didn't come forward with his sensational testimony, until after you had a little talk with him in Reno.
Are you suggesting I did something wrong in Reno?
You met Mr. Buonanova in Reno, on June 14th, last year.
On June 15th, he appeared in Los Angeles with sensational testimony for your husband.
How do you know all this?
I've got evidence.
You're accusing me of suborning perjury.
That's right.
It's not true.
Well, the question is, since this is such a delicate period in your husband's public life, what will the newspapers believe?
I've done nothing wrong.
You're twisting the circumstances around.
Arnold had been looking for Buonanova for a long time.
I just happened to see him there.
He had just returned from Europe and he didn't even know Arnold was looking for him.
Think it over, Julia.
I'm sure you don't want the slightest hint of scandal to touch your husband.
True or not, it will hurt him.
Mona.
Mona, I can't believe this.
We've been such good friends.
What do you want?
I want your husband to tell William Carter that he's not interested in the governor's appointment.
Well, I've got something,
I don't know how much good it'll do.
First of all, His Honor Mayor Henderson hasn't been back in his office all afternoon.
You know where he's been?
No.
Did you speak to Mr. Stratton?
No.
Mona Henderson?
No.
But you did say you have something.
I hope.
If two and two add up right.
The City of Upton is 27,000 strong, give or take a few.
During the last 10 years, the population explosion has been fourfold.
Fourfold?
What does that mean?
It means that at a special election the citizens voted in school and sewer bonds.
And Mr. Stratton?
Has been buying up options on certain parcels of land.
Has the planning commission selected sites and so on?
I don't know.
What do you think?
It's quite possible that Mr. Stratton might have a direct line right into the planning commission's office.
Or through Mona Henderson directly into the mayor's office.
Getting a picture of Susan Connolly in that badger setup could have been
Mona Henderson's way of clearing her own skirts, making it appear that the defection came from the mayor's secretary and not mayor or the mayor's wife.
Della?
DELLA ( over speaker ):
Yes, Perry.
Right here.
Della, keep trying the Henderson home, would you, please?
I'd like to make an appointment with Mrs. Henderson, make it about 8:00.
( tense theme playing )
Oh, hello.
My name is Mason.
I'm an attorney.
I have an appointment with your wife, that is, if you're James Henderson.
Yes, I am.
Come along,
I haven't spoken to my wife in the last few hours.
( gunshot )
What was that?
It sounded like a shot.
Mona?
Mona?
( dramatic theme playing )
( tires screech )
HENDERSON:
Mason.
Mason, my wife...
Mason--?
Yes.
She's dead.
If someone was here in the house, they must have run out the back way.
We'd better call the police.
It must--
It must have been...
It must have been who?
Henderson.
You were just going to tell me who was here, who have fired that shot.
No.
No, Mr. Mason.
I was going to do no such thing.
( mysterious theme playing )
Didn't you say we'd better call the police?
( dialing phone )
You've got just about 90 seconds to talk to me before the police get here, Mr. Mayor.
I have nothing to talk to you about.
I don't even know why you're here.
Susan Connolly is why.
I don't understand.
You mean you haven't spoken to her since lunchtime?
About what?
Ten thousand dollars in cash.
About your wife and a man named Stratton.
About the governor appointing someone as head of the new crime commission.
I talked to Susan on the phone.
I didn't see her.
( siren wailing )
And we'll probably have no further chance to talk alone.
Once again, Mr. Henderson, have you any idea of who killed your wife?
No.
( suspenseful theme playing )
( tense theme playing )
I was home all evening, Mr. Mason.
I heard about Mrs. Henderson on the radio.
I called you at 8:30 last night.
Oh, I-
- I must have gone out for a paper.
I called you again at 9:00 and again at 9:30.
If you were at home, why didn't you answer your telephone?
What kind of car do you drive, Miss Connolly?
A two-tone hardtop.
Red and grey?
Yes.
I saw your car at 8:00 last night in front of the house next door to the Hendersons.
I heard the shot, heard someone running behind the hedge, out into the street.
I saw your car pull out and drive away.
What did you do with the shoes you'd been wearing?
What do you mean?
You left your footprints on the walkway as you ran.
Why did you kill Mona Henderson?
But I didn't.
I didn't.
But you did fired that shot before you ran out of the house.
Yes.
Why?
Because of Mr. Henderson's appointment to the crime...
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mason.
I only wanted to help.
The police want to talk to me.
What should I tell them?
( dramatic theme playing )
I think you'd better tell them the truth.
All of it?
Everything?
Including the firing, the shot and the shoes.
Everything.
Susan, are you in love with him?
He doesn't even know I'm alive.
( dramatic theme playing )
( rings doorbell )
Oh, hello, Mr. Mason.
Sergeant, I'd like to see James Henderson.
He's in the study.
You can go on in.
We've finished our investigation.
Thank you.
HENDERSON:
I know this tragedy can be the cause of some embarrassment at the capital.
I also know that Arnold Webberly would make a fine appointee.
Oh.
Come in.
Sorry to intrude.
Perry Mason, Julia Webberly.
Mrs. Webberly.
How do you do?
William Carter.
Mr. Mason.
Mr. Carter, a privilege.
State committeeman, aren't you?
That's right, counselor.
Oh, I've been told what good personal friends the Webberly's and the Hendersons have been, despite the present rivalry.
Jim, I know how dreadful this has been for you.
Please, let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
Thank you, Julia.
I'll run along.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Mrs. Webberly.
As far as withdrawing, Henderson, well, I'd sleep on it a bit.
Of course I haven't spoken to the governor, but unless I'm mistaken,
I don't think he's going to be influenced unless there's really something to be influenced about.
All right, I'll think it over.
Good.
Always wanted to meet you, counselor.
Sorry it had to be like this.
Mr. Carter.
Jim.
Still nothing to tell me, Mr. Henderson?
Nothing.
What have you told the police?
Just the truth, Mr. Mason.
Now, I have so many things to take care of.
Yes, of course.
How many years had you been married, Mr. Henderson?
Oh, about six years.
No children?
No.
That's your car, Mr. Henderson?
Oh, no.
No.
It's Julia Webber--
Webberly's.
( commotion upstairs )
( dramatic theme playing )
I'm looking for something, Jim.
I-
- I didn't want to bother you about it, but I left it here last week.
A glove.
It must be a pretty important glove.
Do you think Mrs. Henderson deliberately hid it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
MASON:
What are you looking for, Mrs. Webberly?
My glove.
Were you here looking for it last night?
Or perhaps your husband came here for the glove.
My husband is in San Francisco on a case.
He's been there for several days.
Mrs. Webberly, if you have nothing to hide, it's better to be cooperative.
In a courtroom, sometimes, the wrong impression--
I've nothing to hide.
But you were searching for something in here.
MRS. WEBBERLY:
My glove, Mr. Mason.
That's all.
Just my glove.
I'm sorry, Jim.
( suspenseful theme playing )
( knock at door )
Wow, Mrs. Webberly.
Frank, I'll like to talk to you.
Sure.
Isn't it terrible about Mona Henderson?
Yes.
It's about Mona I'm here.
Just think.
She had an appointment with me just the other day for some golf lessons, wanted to correct her backswing.
Frank, do you remember last year in Reno when I won the tournament?
Well, of course I remember.
Well, at the dinner when they presented the cup--
Oh, wasn't that something?
There's the picture right there.
That girl photographer did a fine job.
Oh, I'll treasure that picture as a classic.
All the fanfare of a trophy presentation, the only thing missing was the winner.
Of course, you can be seen in the background there talking with someone.
I'd like that picture, Frank.
Of course.
Take it.
I've got some copies.
Copies?
Why?
Oh, I'm a sentimental guy.
Not all of my pupils win golf tournaments.
Well.
Thanks for the picture.
Seems to me I remember that hunchback, Mrs. Webberly.
Didn't he figure in that civil case your husband was trying?
Got a sensational verdict the day after that picture was taken.
Worth millions in publicity and money.
Some people could say it was more than luck you running into that witness.
Even though you and I both know it was really innocent.
How's your backswing, Mrs. Webberly?
Need some lessons?
Do I?
Oh, about a half dozen should fix you up all right.
My extra-special ones, at 1000 dollars a lesson.
( dramatic theme playing )
I appreciate your reluctance,
Mr. Stratton, but you must--
I did nothing illegal or unethical.
Mason, what do you want?
How well do you know Susan Connolly?
Henderson's secretary?
I don't know her well at all.
Had you had any business dealings with her?
No.
Nothing involving a large sum of money?
No.
What about Mona Henderson?
What about her?
Business dealings with her?
No.
Mr. Stratton, a photograph was taken in room 2O4 at the Highway Hotel--
There is no photograph of me in any hotel room.
( rings )
Excuse me.
I'm on my way.
Hello.
Who?
Just a second.
Who are you?
You don't know me, Mr. Stratton, but I saw you yesterday with a young woman named Susan Connolly in room 204 of the Highway Hotel.
What do you want?
Well, I happen to know you were engaged in a business deal with Mona Henderson.
Now, I'm not greedy...
I wasn't in any hotel room with any young woman.
I'm not engaged in any deal with anyone, and nobody's gonna blackmail me.
Do you understand, fellow?
Nobody.
That's too bad.
Along with you, it's the Connolly girl who's gonna be hurt, Stratton.
( tense theme playing )
The district attorney's office, please.
( upbeat theme playing )
--state will prove that Susan Connolly, the defendant, did use the good offices of her employer,
Mayor James Henderson, to obtain classified information, to dispose of same for illegal profit.
And did coerce, blackmail is a more appropriate word, lie, cheat and steal, and when discovered at her nefarious practices by the deceased, Mona Henderson, did murder her without pity of compunction.
Arnold Webberly.
You can adjudge me a hostile witness all you like,
I categorically deny I had any business dealings with the mayor, James Henderson, or his wife.
What about the mayor's secretary, Susan Connolly?
Or with her.
Now, isn't it true that you met with the defendant in a hotel room at the Highway Hotel for the purpose of giving her 10,000 dollars in exchange for confidential information relating to the land sites selected for civic development?
No.
Did you purchase options to buy certain lots and rights of ways as enumerated here on these locations?
Yes.
I do have options on them.
Fourteen of them.
All 14 of them were recommended by the Planning Commission.
And from this group four will be purchased.
Don't you think it's strange, Mr. Stratton, that you have options on all 14 locations?
No.
Real estate's my business.
I'm good at it.
Besides, that's what I went to see Henderson about that night.
To make a deal to save the city some money since I owned all the options.
What night was this?
The Wednesday Mrs. Henderson was killed.
PROSECUTOR:
And what time was that?
About 7:00.
And did you see Mr. Henderson?
No.
He wasn't home.
Was anybody at home?
Mrs. Henderson.
But I only stayed there a few minutes.
Mrs. Henderson didn't know what time the mayor would arrive, and she was expecting someone any minute.
PROSECUTOR:
Was she?
At approximately 7:00 on the evening of March 22nd, the evening of her murder, she expected a visitor?
Did she say who, Mr. Stratton?
Miss Connolly, Susan Connolly.
PROSECUTOR:
Thank you.
Cross examine.
This deal you spoke of, Mr. Stratton... now, uh, why would you have made a deal with the city when you held all the lots?
Wouldn't the city have to come to you?
I just wanted to expedite the whole thing.
Directly with the mayor?
Weren't there other agencies of the civic government that would've taken care of that?
I thought the mayor could set the wheels in motion.
Why would you go to his home?
Not to his office?
I wanted to make sure I'd see him.
Then you called the mayor before going to his home.
No.
Why not?
I just assumed he'd be there.
I suggest, Mr. Stratton that you went to the mayor's home not to see him, but to see his wife, Mona Henderson.
No, what would I want to see her for?
A photograph.
Isn't it true that you were photographed in a hotel room in the midst of what would be interpreted as an illegal payoff?
I said it before, there is no photograph of me in any hotel room.
MASON:
What happened to the photograph, Mr. Stratton?
Did you buy it from the deceased?
Did you destroyed it?
No.
Did you killed for it, Mr. Stratton?
No.
That's all.
Yes, sir, I knew Mrs. Henderson.
Please tell the court what happened on the morning of March 22nd?
Well, she came to my cottage.
She was all upset.
She said she'd just found out that her husband's secretary had been selling some information to a real estate dealer.
And why did Mrs. Henderson tell this to you?
Well, she was worried about the mayor's reputation, he was up for some kind of an appointment, and she said she'd just overhead something in the office about a date that Miss Connolly had made with this Stratton at the Highway Hotel.
PROSECUTOR:
Go on, Mr. Sykes.
Well, she knew I took pictures of some of the golfing events and wanted me to get a photograph of the meeting, to get the proof on Susan Connolly.
I show you this photograph, and ask if you can identify it.
Yes, sir.
That's the picture I took all right.
That's Susan Connolly and that's Thomas Stratton.
PROSECUTOR:
I ask this photograph be marked State's Exhibit G.
Mr. Mason?
No objection, Your Honor.
Now, Mr. Sykes, what else did the decedent say to you?
She said she'd found out that Susan Connolly was in love with her husband and was blackmailing Mrs. Webberly.
Now, how could the defendant blackmail Mrs. Webberly?
Well, I'll have to explain the background.
Go right ahead.
Ah, Mrs. Webberly won a woman's golf tournament in Reno last year.
At the presentation dinner, she happened to catch sight of a man that her husband needed as a witness in a civil case in Los Angeles.
It was just a lucky accident.
She excused herself and went to plead with this fellow to help her husband.
At that moment, one of those girls in short skirts took a picture at the table.
In back of us Mrs. Webberly was talking with this fellow.
And as a memento of this tournament, did you keep one of the pictures?
Yes.
Along with a lot of others, that I keep on my wall, in the living room.
I see.
Go on, Mr. Sykes.
Well, that witness turned up in Los Angeles the very next day and helped Mrs. Webberly's husband win a handsome verdict.
And that's why she came to me on that day.
PROSECUTOR:
Would you please explain that, Mr. Sykes?
She said she'd been approached by Susan Connolly, who told her the picture could be interpreted as suborning perjury--
You know, buying false testimony.
--and unless her husband declared himself unavailable as head of the new crime commission, she would send a copy of the picture to the papers.
Object, Your Honor.
Most of this testimony is been pure hearsay.
I have refrained from objecting because I wanted to hear the extent of the testimony, but I now ask that it be stricken from the record,
I further ask that the court to admonished the district attorney and assign the question to misconduct.
I agree.
Objection sustained.
The answer will be stricken.
I'd like to ask Mr. Thorne why he is not presenting best evidence.
We are trying to reach Mrs. Webberly, Your Honor.
This evidence only came to our attention an hour before court convened this morning.
If the court please,
I am asking this witness to recount what Mrs. Webberly told him only for the purpose of showing background.
I will stipulate that this present testimony will go only to the state of mind of Mr. Sykes at that time and will not be held as evidence of actions on the part of Susan Connolly, the defendant.
I will, promise the court however that we intend to put Mrs. Webberly on the stand to prove the conversation at firsthand.
We are now finished with this witness.
Since this is a hearing addressed entirely to the discretion of the court,
I will refrain from ruling on the motion to strike until Mrs. Webberly has been placed on the stand.
Cross examine, Mr. Mason.
Under the circumstances, I would like to defer my cross examination of this witness until Mrs. Webberly has testified, Your Honor.
Unless I there is vigorous opposition from the district attorney,
I will permit this unusual procedure.
No opposition at all, Your Honor.
You may step down.
Call your next witness.
Sergeant Ralph Reynolds to the stand.
Defendant's fingerprints were found on the sill of the service room window and on the windowpane itself.
Now, I show you this revolver and ask if you can identify it.
Yes.
It's the murder weapon, registered to James M. Henderson.
It was found in the murder room.
Now this box of cartridges.
.32's for the revolver.
We found it in a drawer in the murder room.
Defense will stipulate the fatal bullet came from that box of cartridges.
Now I show you these moulages and ask if you can identify them.
Defense will further stipulate the defendant was at the scene of the murder.
Then I have no more questions.
Your witness.
Sergeant, the revolver holds how many cartridges?
Six.
How many unexploded cartridges were in the gun?
There were five unexploded cartridges and one empty cartridge case.
There seems to be seven cartridges missing from this new box.
Perhaps, uh, two bullets were fired from the gun.
REYNOLDS:
Well, only one was found.
Perhaps after the first bullet was fired, the revolver was reloaded.
We found only one bullet in deceased's body.
There is a window in the murder room that looks onto the rear of the house, is there not, Sergeant?
Yes.
MASON:
A shot could have been fired from the gun out through that window, could it not?
Well, yes, I suppose.
Thank you sergeant, That will be all.
James Henderson to the stand.
MAN:
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
MR. HENDERSON:
I do.
MAN:
State your name.
James Henderson.
Be seated.
I call your attention, Mr. Henderson, to the evening of Wednesday, March 22nd.
Yes, sir?
THORNE:
Please tell the court what transpired when you arrived at about 8:00, approximately the same time as Perry Mason, the defense attorney.
I was about to open my front door when I heard something that sounded like a shot from inside of the house.
THORNE:
What did you do?
I went inside.
Mason stayed at the front door.
I found my wife in the study, dead.
I went back for Mason.
Are you familiar with your secretary's automobile, Mr. Henderson?
( tense theme playing )
Yes.
I ask if you noticed anything in the front of your home on the street at that moment?
Mr. Henderson, you will answer the question.
Yes.
What did you see?
A car driving away.
Did you recognize the car?
Yes.
It was Susan's.
THORNE:
Did you know Miss Connolly would be at your home?
No.
Had you reason to believe she would be at your home?
Now, I have refrained from indulging in legal theatrics,
I could put the defense attorney himself on the stand to corroborate all the evidence surrounding this particular time of evening at your home, but this evidence has been educed for the court without it.
Now I ask you, Mr. Henderson, did you have reason to believe your secretary,
Susan Connolly, would be at your home?
Yes, yes, she--
She phoned me.
She told me she was going to be there.
( dramatic theme playing )
(telephone ringing )
Hi, Perry.
He went into his house about 45 minutes ago.
What about the police?
Well, Sergeant Reynolds's been in there for about five minutes now.
Ah, wait a minute, he's just coming out, which probably means that Julia Webberly is not there.
But Arnold Webberly is.
Oh, no.
You stay right where you are, Paul.
We need Julia Webberly.
All right, Perry.
No sign of her yet.
Perry, if we do get her to testify, she'll prove Frank Sykes is lying, won't she?
And that would mean that it wasn't Susan who did the blackmailing, it was Mona.
That's where Sykes has been so clever, Della.
He's given Webberly a clean bill of health.
He's said to Julia in effect, "Here I've cleared you,
"I've established the innocence of that meeting in Reno, now you've got to back me up on the story I told."
So all Julia has to do is go along with Sykes's story and her husband will probably get the appointment.
It's my guess that right now she's making a decision.
One way or the other, we'll find out what it is in court.
( dramatic theme playing )
MASON:
I'd like a complete picture of what happened, Mr. Henderson.
You said the defendant told you she was going to your home.
Yes, she did.
When and how did she tell you?
At about a 7:15.
On the phone.
Where were you at the time?
In my office.
After the call, what did you do?
I finished up some work and went home, met you there.
That revolver shot we both heard.
Did you suspect that it was Susan who fired it?
Let me hypothesize, Mr. Henderson.
How long does it take you to drive from your office to your home?
Um, about ten minutes.
Takes Miss Connolly about, uh, a half an hour from her place.
What does that mean?
Well, hadn't she told you what really happened concerning Mrs. Stratton, your wife, and the hotel room?
Yes.
She had.
MASON:
You then realized your own wife had deceived you.
Now, isn't it possible that when Mrs. Connolly arrived at your home and found your wife dead, she jumped to the conclusion that you'd killed her?
And isn't that why, when she saw us at the front door she fired a shot to confuse the issue, to protect you, to cover you with an alibi?
No further questions.
She must've been there all the time, Perry.
She and her husband came out together.
JUDGE:
Call your next witness.
Your Honor, the prosecution rests its case.
We have proved the murder was committed and we have established the grave probability that it was perpetrated by the defendant.
We therefore ask Miss Susan Connolly be bound over for trial by jury.
Mr. Mason?
Well, Your Honor, it was my understanding that the prosecution was going to put
Julia Webberly on the stand.
The prosecution feels its case is concluded.
But, Your Honor-- JUDGE:
Just a moment, Mr. Mason.
Now, Mr. Thorne, you will call Mrs. Julia Webberly to the stand.
I recall your promise to produce her.
Your Honor, we are not prepared at this time to examine Mrs. Webberly.
I'm not inclined to argue with you, Mr. Thorne.
I want Mrs. Julia Webberly on the stand and I want the defense to have the opportunity to cross-examine her.
If you make no direct examination,
I will permit the cross the greatest latitude.
Now what do you say, Mr. Thorne?
The prosecution does not wish to examine Mrs. Webberly at this time.
Julia Webberly, come to the stand.
Swear the witness in.
MAN:
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I was frightened.
If the newspapers printed the story, true or not,
I felt I could never convince anyone that it was all innocent and aboveboard and--
Well, at the time, anyway, just a happy coincidence.
And then my husband told me what Frank Sykes said in court this morning and I realized that Frank was giving me a chance to make sure of the governor's appointment for Arnold.
All I'd have to do was corroborate the story.
It was very tempting.
But it was a lie, Mr. Mason.
There wasn't a word of truth in Frank Sykes' testimony.
Then it wasn't Susan Connolly who blackmailed you with the photograph, Mrs. Webberly?
No.
It was Mona Henderson first.
And second?
Frank Sykes.
You understand, the blackmail this time was purely for money.
Six thousand dollars.
Thank you, Mrs. Webberly.
That'll be all.
Now, Your Honor,
I would like to cross-examine Frank Sykes as stipulated this morning.
Frank Sykes to the stand.
I will remind you, Mr. Sykes, you're still under oath.
Well, you can't hang a guy for trying to make a living, can you?
The truth is then, is that it was Mona Henderson, and not the defendant, who had this illegal deal with Thomas Stratton?
Well, you'll have to ask Stratton about that yourself.
Well, I intend to.
How did Mona Henderson get the photograph of Julia Webberly and Buonanova?
She saw it in my room.
Took it right off from under my nose.
How did you find out about it, Mr. Sykes?
Well, I got a call from Mrs. Webberly.
About the photograph?
That's right.
She was pretty upset.
MASON:
What time was that call?
It was that evening, about, oh, 6:00, I guess.
And at that time it occurred to you that this photograph could be an instrument for blackmail?
SYKES:
Right, yes it did.
Kind of late.
I could never put two and two together, like Mona Henderson.
After Mrs. Webberly spoke to you, what did you do?
Ah, what was there to do?
I would think you might have tried to find out what Mona Henderson had seen in this photograph, what it was about it that upset Mrs. Webberly so much.
Well, I did phone Mona.
And she told you what you wanted to know on the telephone?
That's right.
Then you went to see her.
No.
Then how did you get this photograph back?
You did get it back, did you not?
You showed it to Mrs. Webberly later on.
Yes, that's right.
Uh, uh--
I got the photograph back the next morning.
At the Henderson's home?
That's right.
But I was at the Henderson home the next morning, Mr. Sykes.
So were the police.
Now, how could you--?
I guess it was the same afternoon then, and I just don't recall exactly.
But it couldn't have been that same afternoon.
You testified you first heard about it when Mrs. Webberly called you, about 6:00 that evening.
So it must've been after 6:00 that evening when you called Mona Henderson.
Yes.
I guess it was.
And it must have been close to 7:00 when you arrived at the Henderson home.
I don't know the exact time.
Well, was probably between 7:00 and 7:45, because at a 7:45 you had already left and Mrs. Henderson had already been shot.
Now, it was between 7:00 and 7:45, was it not, Mr. Sykes?
What happened during that time?
Nothing happened.
I asked for the photograph back and she gave it to me.
And she just handed the photograph over to you?
Just like that.
What else could she do?
Oh, any number of things.
She could have laughed at you, for instance.
Laugh?
No, she didn't laugh.
She could have told you to go peddle your golf lessons.
She could have said no to your blackmail demands, sending your dreams of getting your hands on a lot of money right out the window.
And what did she say to you, Mr. Sykes?
She got angry.
She threatened you?
She tried to shoot me.
She went for the gun and I grabbed it from her.
And it went off.
She just stood there looking at me with the queerest look not believing it, if you know what I mean, not believing that I'd really shoot her.
Rotten luck.
Everything was going fine.
It's rotten luck.
( dramatic theme playing )
I've told Carter
I'm not available for the appointment and I think the governor couldn't do better than Arnold Webberly.
Was a brave thing you did, Susan.
Even if it was illegal.
She will have to face charges, won't she, Mr. Mason?
Carter indicated he would use whatever influence he has to get the court to grant Susan probation.
That, uh--
That gun...
How did it get in to your home, Mr. Henderson?
Oh, I brought it home.
From the office.
And the box of cartridges too.
Certainly had me guessing for a while.
You thought that I killed Mona?
The details fit so well.
Any plans, Susan?
Not for a while.
Mr. Henderson?
Oh, my job is waiting for me.
And speaking of jobs, thank you so much.
Mayor Henderson.
Thank you, Mr. Mason.
Susan.
Good bye.
Good bye.

[Clock Ticking]
[Snapping]
No!
[Screams]
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- [Whispers] No.
- One of the girls.
[Horn Honks]
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- [Door Closes]
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
- [Door Opening]
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
[Man] Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
[Clears Throat]
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
- Thank you.
- [Register Bell Rings]
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
[Chuckling Nervously]
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
[Register Bell Rings]
Thank you.
- [Peter] Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.

- [Music] [Ragtime] - [Knock On Door]
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
[Music] [Continues]
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
[Knock On Door]
- On the house.
- [Milly] Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
- [Door Closes]
- It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
[Lorraine] Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...

[All Cheering] Twenty-one!
[Music] Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you [Music]
[Music] Happy birthday, dear Helen [Music]
[Music] Happy birthday to you [Music]
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
[Chattering Continues]
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
[Knock On Door]
[Knock On Door]
- [Knocking Continues]
- A minute.
[Knocking Continues]
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, l-I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
l-I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, l-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and l-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, l-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- [Mark] My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- [Mark] Switch it off?
- [Helen] No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
[Screams] What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
[Man's Voice] That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
her funeral.
And this:
her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
[Knock On Door]
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
[Man] Cut!
[Man On Phone] Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- [Jarvis] But is it commercial?
- [Man] Anglo want it.
[Jarvis] Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- [Director] We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- [Director] All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
[Gasps]
- Oh, miss.
- [Director] Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
[Director] 8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.

Well, are you there?

- [Mark] Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
[Music] [Snare Drum]
[Music] [Kettle Drum Joins In]
[Music] [Bongos Join In]
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
[Music] [Other Instruments Join In]
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
[Giggling] I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
[Laughing]
[Tape Rewinding]
[Music] [Starts Again]
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
[Crying] Take it away.
Mark!
[Screams] Mark!
[Helen] And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
[Exhales]
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
[Scoffs] I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
[Door Closes]
- [Knock On Door]
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
- Won't be long!
- [Timer Ticking]
[Man's Voice] I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
l-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
l-I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Ringing]
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- [Woman] Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- [Michael] I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- [Man] Anyone seen Viv?
- [Director] Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- [Director] No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- [Man] All right, quiet.
[Director] All right.
Ready?
Action.
- [Michael] Here we are, Madam.
- [Diane] Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
[Director Muttering]
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
[Director] There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
[Director] That's it, and back you go.
[Continues, Indistinct]
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
[Screams]
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
[Bell Ringing]
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- [Mark] Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- [Woman] Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
- [Knock On Door]
- Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
[Ringing]
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
[Door Closes]
I warned 'im.
[Man, Indistinct]
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
[Music] [Whistling]
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
L-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
[Music]
[Snapping Fingers]
Baxter!
- [Clicks]
- Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- [Miller] Right.
[Pens, Pencils Landing]
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
[lmitating Tweety Bird] I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
[Helen] "She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
- The back of my neck told me.
- [Chuckles]
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
- Have you been running, young man?
- [Sound Of Pulse Pounding]
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- [Helen] Brookwood, I think.
- [Mrs. Stephens] Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
- [Chuckles]
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
L...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
- Sounds fun.
- [Vehicle Departing]
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
[Ticking]
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
[Laughing] Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- [Door Slams]
- Oh, he'll wake Mother.
[Water Running]
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
[Door Shuts]
[Door Slams]
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
[Stammers] I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- L...
I feel at home here.
l-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
[Crying]
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- L...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
- [Film Rolling]
- Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
l-I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
[Clock Ticking]
- [Birds Chirping] - [Children Chattering]
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- [Phil] Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
[Indistinct Chatter]
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
[Man] All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of...
[Man Sneezing] of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- [Michael] Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
L-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
[Screaming, Crying]
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
- [Indistinct]
- Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
- I'm... a focus puller.
- [Music] [Man Whistling]
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
l-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
l-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
[Sneezing]
[Man] Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- [Director] Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
[Sighs]
- [Clicks]
- Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- I didn't stand up my gentleman friend...
- [Clicks] and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
[Bell Rings]
[Door Slams]
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
[Knocking]
Mark?
Mark?
[Whispers] Mark.
[Liquid Dripping]
- [Birds Chirping] - [Children Shouting]
[Dripping Continues]
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
[Gasping]
[Whimpering]
[Screams]
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
- [TV:
Indistinct] - [Ringing]
[Lowers Volume]
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
[Mark, Breathing Heavily] Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
[Child Screaming]
- Aged five.
- [Screaming Continues]
[Child Crying]
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
- [Woman Laughing]
- Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- [Man] Here.
Open this one.
- [Mrs. Stephens, Indistinct]
- Your mother's.
[Glass Clinking]
- Tony's.
- [Tony] No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- [Woman] I don't care.
- [Tony] But, darling.
- [Woman] Tony, stop it!
- [Tony] The door is locked.
[Woman] I don't care.
I'm scared.
- Turn it off.
- [Clicks]
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
[Sobbing]
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
- [Woman Screaming]
- When they felt the spike... touching their throat, and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
[Whimpering] Frightened for you.
[Siren Blaring]
[Continues]
[Tires Squealing]
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- [Glass Breaking]
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
[Men Yelling]
[Miller] All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
[Cries, Screams Overlapping]
Give yourself up, Mark!
[Crying]
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
[Sobbing Hysterically]
[Thudding]
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
[Grunting]
[Coughs, Gasping]
[Moans]
[Men Grunting]
Girl's alive.
[Tapes Continue]
Go get an ambulance.
[Dr. Lewis] All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
[Young Mark] Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
(Camera mechanism whirs)
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- Oh, no!
- One of the girls.
(Camera whirs)
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
It's shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some 'views' for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
Oh, no!
No, no, no.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiancé saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy ear hole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
Mark?
Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I-I mustn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
Yes.
How long have you lived here?
Nearly all my life.
I-I was born in this house.
Oh?
It's my father's.
Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He...
He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
Oh, thank you.
Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side, I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- Are these all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, I-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
I don't know what to show you.
Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen... this is the first 21 st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
(Mark) Switch it off?
(Helen) No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- I wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
(Father) 'That will do, Mark.
'Dry your eyes and stop being silly.'
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how did it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
Not mine.
Won't you try to explain?
- You'd better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You'd better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye...
to my mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this - her funeral.
And this - her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
He was brilliant.
A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
(Knock on door)
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
(Director) Cut!
(Speaker-phone) 'Look, Mr Jarvis, this picture's a commercial proposition.
'That's why I want you to do it - it's your type of thing you so do well.
'I've talked to Johnnie already and he's crazy to do it...'
These are the figures you wanted, Mr Jarvis.
(Man on speaker-phone continues) 'This script is gonna...'
Still behind schedule.
'And you know that Paramount want it.
'Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.'
- But is it commercial?
- 'Anglo want it.'
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's OK.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be!
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- OK.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
I'm meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favourite stand-in today?
- Standing it.
(Assistant director) 8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
Well, where are you?
(Distant voice) Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
We're using their power.
We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
They won't come in.
They'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
Hmm.
Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
"You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
- Do you mind if I warm up?
- Go ahead.
(Rhythmic music plays)
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
(Camera whirrs)
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's going to put me in there?
Yes, Viv.
Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine...
this would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
That.
Mark!
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
(Screams) Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news... unless you want the football results.
Hmm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
He's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
(Knock on door)
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
I won't be long!
(Mr Lewis) 'I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... 'for their valuable contributions:
'Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
'Mr.
Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... 'and Mark Lewis, my son...'
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
Happy birthday.
Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really...
It isn't much.
I-I don't know anything about 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
Please.
Oh, Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm going to put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Um... the first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
(Heavy ticking)
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
- Some short stories.
I'd like to read them.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
What is it about?
A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take.
- I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- I'll take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I photograph for nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Er, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
And ask... excuse me a second, darling for a white one, then when he brings the white one.
Then you ask for a different one...
This one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just DO it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
Who?
Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
(Director mumbles instructions)
(Muttering continues) Carrying your bag...
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, head up, and tight in to him there.
Very good.
(Screams)
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
(Bell rings)
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass by my place.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
To collect your kid's autograph book?
That's it, Chief.
If the nipper finds out where I've been...
All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
What about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him, but he was carrying something she couldn't see.
Oh, that's a help (!
)
Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
What was it she saw?
Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone.
So we'll try not to interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, er, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
Have you been filming those policemen?
Mmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
Documentary, eh?
What's it about?
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished... and it will be soon.
Suppose they catch you?
Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
Mark, you're next.
Don't get into trouble.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
(Knocks on door)
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
I don't know if she heard me.
- What did you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
Oh?
Where?
Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
(Phone rings)
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell him.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- All right, sir.
Gotcha!
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- OK.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned him.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
No doubt at all - the wounds caused by the same instrument.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
What sort of shock?
That's up to you to find out, Inspector.
It's not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes, I have finished.
Come on, fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
(Music plays)
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
(Cartoon voice) I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get him quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
(Helen reads) "She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
"The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
"A spokesman said that her performance showed such promise...
"that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling.
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of him.
Where is he taking you?
I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
- (Pounding heartbeat)
- Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
I didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Nothing.
Thank you very much.
Mother, I've left your supper...
Tell me, young man, which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Good night.
Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
- That camera.
Oh.
I...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
What does your magic camera photograph?
People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
(Heavy ticking)
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment...
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
That's what I was going to say, what a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, your magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- Oh, he will wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
(Clatter)
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
I can't get used to them.
I-I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- N-Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
I'd never know.
You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
(Mark walls)
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
(Camera whirrs)
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't...
don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I-I won't be selfish.
You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you...
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Er, yeah.
Yeah.
OK.
(Whispers) Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
I heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy.
I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... (Sneeze) ...of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Looking for a hat, madam?
Yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Um, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
(Agitated voice) In red?
Have you one in blue?
(Screaming) In blue.
In blue!
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
(Indistinct)
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in... before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
I can't wait to show you this.
I should charge you.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Mmm, she's terrific.
I've got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Yeah, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
About what?
- Voyeurism.
- Eh?
What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
I can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
it might be my only chance.
Well, be here at six o'clock, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- Six o'clock.
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Have you got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on manoeuvres with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
I didn't stand up my gentleman friend and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street!
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
It might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
- To leave something for Mark.
You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
- It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
See you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
(Whispers) Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
(Phone rings)
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
I must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
(Frantic screaming)
Aged five.
(Sobbing and wailing)
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
(Laughter and chatter)
Your room.
(Flicks switch)
(Woman's slurred speech)
Your mother's.
(Glass breaks)
(Flicks switch)
Tony's.
(Tony) 'No one will come in.'
(Helen) 'I don't care.' (Tony) 'But, darling.'
- 'Tony, stop it!
' - 'The door is locked.'
'I don't care.
I'm scared.'
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
(Echoing scream)
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
I'm frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- OK, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
Give yourself up, Mark!
I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
(Voices outside)
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
(Symphony of wailing)
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No, Mark!
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
(Battering at door)
The girl's alive.
Go and get an ambulance.
(Professor Lewis) 'All right, all right.
Don't be a silly boy.
'There's nothing to be afraid of.'
(Mark) 'Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.

- Shocking, isn't it?
- [Door Closes]
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
- [Door Opening]
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
[Man] Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.

Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
[Chuckling Nervously]
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.

Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
## [Continues]
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiancé saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
[Knock On Door]
- On the house.
- [Milly] Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
- [Door Closes]
- It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
[Lorraine] Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...

[All Cheering] Twenty-one!
# Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Helen #
# Happy birthday to you ##
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
[Chattering Continues]
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
[Knock On Door]
[Knock On Door]
- [Knocking Continues]
- A minute.
[Knocking Continues]
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I-I mustn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
I-I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, I-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- [Mark] My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- [Mark] Switch it off?
- [Helen] No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
[Screams] What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
[Man's Voice] That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
Her funeral.
And this:
Her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
[Knock On Door]
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
[Man] Cut!
[Man On Phone] Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- [Jarvis] But is it commercial?
- [Man] Anglo want it.
[Jarvis] Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- [Director] We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- [Director] All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
[Gasps]
- Oh, miss.
- [Director] Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
[Director] 8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.

Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- [Mark] Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
## [Snare Drum]
## [Kettle Drum Joins In]
## [Bongos Join In]
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
## [Other Instruments Join In]
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
[Giggling] I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
[Laughing]
[Tape Rewinding]
## [Starts Again]
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
[Crying] Take it away.
Mark!
[Screams] Mark!
[Helen] And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
[Exhales]
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
[Scoffs] I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
[Door Closes]
- [Knock On Door]
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
- Won't be long!
- [Timer Ticking]
[Man's Voice] I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
I-I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Ringing]
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- and ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- [Woman] Sorry.
For a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- [Michael] I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- [Man] Anyone seen Viv?
- [Director] Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- [Director] No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- [Man] All right, quiet.
[Director] All right.
Ready?
Action.
- [Michael] Here we are, Madam.
- [Diane] Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
[Director Muttering]
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
[Director] There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
[Director] That's it, and back you go.
[Continues, Indistinct]
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
[Screams]
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
[Bell Ringing]
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- [Mark] Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- [Woman] Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
- [Knock On Door]
- Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
[Ringing]
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
[Door Closes]
I warned 'im.
[Man, Indistinct]
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
## [Whistling]
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
I-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
[Snapping Fingers]
Baxter!
- [Clicks]
- Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- [Miller] Right.
[Pens, Pencils Landing]
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
[Imitating Tweety Bird] I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
[Helen] "She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
- The back of my neck told me.
- [Chuckles]
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
- Have you been running, young man?
- [Sound Of Pulse Pounding]
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- [Helen] Brookwood, I think.
- [Mrs. Stephens] Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
- [Chuckles]
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
I...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
- Sounds fun.
- [Vehicle Departing]
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
[Ticking]
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
[Laughing] Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- [Door Slams]
- Oh, he'll wake Mother.
[Water Running]
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
[Door Shuts]
[Door Slams]
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
[Stammers] I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
[Crying]
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
- [Film Rolling]
- Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I-I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
[Clock Ticking]
- [Birds Chirping] - [Children Chattering]
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- [Phil] Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
[Indistinct Chatter]
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
[Man] All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of...
[Man Sneezing]
Of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- [Michael] Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
I-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
[Screaming, Crying]
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
- [Indistinct]
- Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
- I'm... a focus puller.
- ## [Man Whistling]
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
[Sneezing]
[Man] Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- [Director] Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
[Sighs]
- [Clicks]
- Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- I didn't stand up my gentleman friend...
- [Clicks]
And come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
[Bell Rings]
[Door Slams]
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
[Knocking]
Mark?
Mark?
[Whispers] Mark.
[Liquid Dripping]
- [Birds Chirping] - [Children Shouting]
[Dripping Continues]
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
[Gasping]
[Whimpering]
[Screams]
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
- [TV:
Indistinct] - [Ringing]
[Lowers Volume]
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
[Mark, Breathing Heavily] Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
[Child Screaming]
- Aged five.
- [Screaming Continues]
[Child Crying]
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
- [Woman Laughing]
- Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- [Man] Here.
Open this one.
- [Mrs. Stephens, Indistinct]
- Your mother's.
[Glass Clinking]
- Tony's.
- [Tony] No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- [Woman] I don't care.
- [Tony] But, darling.
- [Woman] Tony, stop it!
- [Tony] The door is locked.
[Woman] I don't care.
I'm scared.
- Turn it off.
- [Clicks]
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
[Sobbing]
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
- [Woman Screaming]
- When they felt the spike... touching their throat, and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
[Whimpering] Frightened for you.
[Siren Blaring]
[Continues]
[Tires Squealing]
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- [Glass Breaking]
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
[Men Yelling]
[Miller] All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
[Cries, Screams Overlapping]
Give yourself up, Mark!
[Crying]
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
[Sobbing Hysterically]
[Thudding]
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
[Grunting]
[Coughs, Gasping]
[Moans]
[Men Grunting]

[Tapes Continue]
Go get an ambulance.
[Dr. Lewis] All right.

There's nothing to be afraid of.
[Young Mark] Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.

- Murder.
- [Whispers] No.
- One of the girls.
[Horn Honks]
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- [Door Closes]
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
- [Door Opening]
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
[Man] Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
[Clears Throat]
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
- Thank you.
- [Register Bell Rings]
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
[Chuckling Nervously]
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
[Register Bell Rings]
Thank you.
- [Peter] Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
[Door Bell Rings]
- [Door Closes]
- Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
- [Music] [Ragtime] - [Knock On Door]
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
[Music] [Continues]
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
[Knock On Door]
- On the house.
- [Milly] Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
- [Door Closes]
- It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
[Lorraine] Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
[Chattering]
[All Cheering] Twenty-one!
[Music] Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you [Music]
[Music] Happy birthday, dear Helen [Music]
[Music] Happy birthday to you [Music]
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
[Chattering Continues]
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
[Knock On Door]
[Knock On Door]
- [Knocking Continues]
- A minute.
[Knocking Continues]
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, l-I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
l-I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, l-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and l-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, l-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- [Mark] My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- [Mark] Switch it off?
- [Helen] No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
[Screams] What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
[Man's Voice] That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
her funeral.
And this:
her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
[Knock On Door]
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
[Man] Cut!
[Man On Phone] Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- [Jarvis] But is it commercial?
- [Man] Anglo want it.
[Jarvis] Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- [Director] We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- [Director] All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
[Gasps]
- Oh, miss.
- [Director] Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
[Director] 8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.

Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
[Music] [Snare Drum]
[Music] [Kettle Drum Joins In]
[Music] [Bongos Join In]
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
[Music] [Other Instruments Join In]
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
[Giggling] I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
[Laughing]
[Tape Rewinding]
[Music] [Starts Again]
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
[Crying] Take it away.
Mark!
[Screams] Mark!
[Helen] And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
[Exhales]
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
[Scoffs] I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
[Door Closes]
- [Knock On Door]
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
- Won't be long!
- [Timer Ticking]
[Man's Voice] I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
l-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
l-I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Ringing]
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- [Woman] Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- [Michael] I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- [Man] Anyone seen Viv?
- [Director] Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- [Director] No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- [Man] All right, quiet.
[Director] All right.
Ready?
Action.
- [Michael] Here we are, Madam.
- [Diane] Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
[Director Muttering]
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
[Director] There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
[Director] That's it, and back you go.
[Continues, Indistinct]
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
[Screams]
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
[Bell Ringing]
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- [Mark] Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- [Woman] Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
- [Knock On Door]
- Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
[Ringing]
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
[Door Closes]
I warned 'im.
[Man, Indistinct]
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
[Music] [Whistling]
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
L-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
[Music]
[Snapping Fingers]
Baxter!
- [Clicks]
- Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- [Miller] Right.
[Pens, Pencils Landing]
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
[lmitating Tweety Bird] I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
[Helen] "She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
- The back of my neck told me.
- [Chuckles]
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
- Have you been running, young man?
- [Sound Of Pulse Pounding]
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- [Helen] Brookwood, I think.
- [Mrs. Stephens] Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
- [Chuckles]
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
L...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
- Sounds fun.
- [Vehicle Departing]
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
[Ticking]
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
[Laughing] Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- [Door Slams]
- Oh, he'll wake Mother.
[Water Running]
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
[Door Shuts]
[Door Slams]
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
[Stammers] I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- L...
I feel at home here.
l-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
[Crying]
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- L...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
- [Film Rolling]
- Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
l-I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
[Clock Ticking]
- [Birds Chirping] - [Children Chattering]
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- [Phil] Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
[Indistinct Chatter]
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
[Man] All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of...
[Man Sneezing] of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- [Michael] Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
L-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
[Screaming, Crying]
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
- [Indistinct]
- Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
- I'm... a focus puller.
- [Music] [Man Whistling]
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
l-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
l-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
[Sneezing]
[Man] Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- [Director] Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
[Sighs]
- [Clicks]
- Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- I didn't stand up my gentleman friend...
- [Clicks] and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
[Bell Rings]
[Door Slams]
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
[Knocking]
Mark?
Mark?
[Whispers] Mark.
[Liquid Dripping]
- [Birds Chirping] - [Children Shouting]
[Dripping Continues]
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
[Gasping]
[Whimpering]
[Screams]
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
- [TV:
Indistinct] - [Ringing]
[Lowers Volume]
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
[Mark, Breathing Heavily] Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
[Child Screaming]
- Aged five.
- [Screaming Continues]
[Child Crying]
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
- [Woman Laughing]
- Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- [Man] Here.
Open this one.
- [Mrs. Stephens, Indistinct]
- Your mother's.
[Glass Clinking]
- Tony's.
- [Tony] No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- [Woman] I don't care.
- [Tony] But, darling.
- [Woman] Tony, stop it!
- [Tony] The door is locked.
[Woman] I don't care.
I'm scared.
- Turn it off.
- [Clicks]
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
[Sobbing]
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
- [Woman Screaming]
- When they felt the spike... touching their throat, and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
[Whimpering] Frightened for you.
[Siren Blaring]
[Continues]
[Tires Squealing]
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- [Glass Breaking]
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
[Men Yelling]
[Miller] All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
[Cries, Screams Overlapping]
Give yourself up, Mark!
[Crying]
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
[Sobbing Hysterically]
[Thudding]
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
[Grunting]
[Coughs, Gasping]
[Moans]
[Men Grunting]
Girl's alive.
[Tapes Continue]
Go get an ambulance.
[Dr. Lewis] All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
[Young Mark] Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- Oh, no!
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
It's shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some 'views' for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
Oh, no!
No, no, no.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiancé saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy ear hole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
Mark?
Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I-I mustn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
Yes.
How long have you lived here?
Nearly all my life.
I-I was born in this house.
Oh?
It's my father's.
Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He...
He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
Oh, thank you.
Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side, I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- Are these all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, I-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
I don't know what to show you.
Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen... this is the first 21 st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- I wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
'That will do, Mark.
'Dry your eyes and stop being silly.'
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how did it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
Not mine.
Won't you try to explain?
- You'd better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You'd better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye...
to my mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this - her funeral.
And this - her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
He was brilliant.
A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
'Look, Mr Jarvis, this picture's a commercial proposition.
'That's why I want you to do it - it's your type of thing you so do well.
'I've talked to Johnnie already and he's crazy to do it...'
These are the figures you wanted, Mr Jarvis.
'This script is gonna...'
Still behind schedule.
'And you know that Paramount want it.
'Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.'
- But is it commercial?
- 'Anglo want it.'
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's OK.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be!
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- OK.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
I'm meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favourite stand-in today?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
Well, where are you?
Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
We're using their power.
We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
They won't come in.
They'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
Hmm.
Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
"You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
- Do you mind if I warm up?
- Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's going to put me in there?
Yes, Viv.
Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine...
this would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
That.
Mark!
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news... unless you want the football results.
Hmm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
He's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
I won't be long!
'I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... 'for their valuable contributions:
'Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
'Mr.
Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... 'and Mark Lewis, my son...'
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
Happy birthday.
Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really...
It isn't much.
I-I don't know anything about 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
Please.
Oh, Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm going to put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Um... the first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
- Some short stories.
I'd like to read them.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
What is it about?
A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take.
- I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- I'll take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I photograph for nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Er, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
And ask... excuse me a second, darling for a white one, then when he brings the white one.
Then you ask for a different one...
This one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just DO it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
Who?
Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Carrying your bag...
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, head up, and tight in to him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass by my place.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
To collect your kid's autograph book?
That's it, Chief.
If the nipper finds out where I've been...
All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
What about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him, but he was carrying something she couldn't see.
Oh, that's a help.
Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
What was it she saw?
Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone.
So we'll try not to interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, er, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
Have you been filming those policemen?
Mmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
Documentary, eh?
What's it about?
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished... and it will be soon.
Suppose they catch you?
Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
Mark, you're next.
Don't get into trouble.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
I don't know if she heard me.
- What did you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
Oh?
Where?
Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell him.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- All right, sir.
Gotcha!
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- OK.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned him.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
No doubt at all - the wounds caused by the same instrument.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
What sort of shock?
That's up to you to find out, Inspector.
It's not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes, I have finished.
Come on, fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get him quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
"The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
"A spokesman said that her performance showed such promise...
"that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling.
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of him.
Where is he taking you?
I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
I didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Nothing.
Thank you very much.
Mother, I've left your supper...
Tell me, young man, which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Good night.
Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
- That camera.
Oh.
I...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
What does your magic camera photograph?
People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment...
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
That's what I was going to say, what a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, your magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- Oh, he will wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
I can't get used to them.
I-I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- N-Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
I'd never know.
You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't...
don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I-I won't be selfish.
You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you...
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Er, yeah.
Yeah.
OK.
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
I heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy.
I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Looking for a hat, madam?
Yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Um, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue!
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in... before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
I can't wait to show you this.
I should charge you.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Mmm, she's terrific.
I've got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Yeah, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
About what?
- Voyeurism.
- Eh?
What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
I can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
it might be my only chance.
Well, be here at six o'clock, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- Six o'clock.
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Have you got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on manoeuvres with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
I didn't stand up my gentleman friend and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street!
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
It might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
- To leave something for Mark.
You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
- It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
See you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
I must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
Your room.
Your mother's.
Tony's.
'No one will come in.'
- 'I don't care.' - 'But, darling.'
- 'Tony, stop it!
' - 'The door is locked.'
'I don't care.
I'm scared.'
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
I'm frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- OK, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
Give yourself up, Mark!
I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No, Mark!
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
The girl's alive.
Go and get an ambulance.
'All right, all right.
Don't be a silly boy.
'There's nothing to be afraid of.'
'Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- No.
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, l-I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
l-I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, l-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and l-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, l-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
her funeral.
And this:
her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
And that, darling, is the end of the news.
Oh, unless you want the football results.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
Won't be long!
I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
l-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
l-I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, Madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
Excuse me, Chief?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned 'im.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
L-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
Brookwood, I think.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
L...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
Oh, he'll wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- L...
I feel at home here.
l-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- L...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
l-I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
L-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
l-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
l-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
I didn't stand up my gentleman friend... and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- Here.
Open this one.
Your mother's.
- Tony's.
- No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- I don't care.
- But, darling.
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.
I don't care.
I'm scared.
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
Frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
Girl's alive.
Go get an ambulance.
All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
(Camera mechanism whirs)
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- Oh, no!
- One of the girls.
(Camera whirs)
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
It's shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some 'views' for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
Oh, no!
No, no, no.
I'lI-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiancé saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy ear hole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
Mark?
Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I-I mustn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
Yes.
How long have you lived here?
Nearly all my life.
I-I was born in this house.
Oh?
It's my father's.
Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He...
He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
Oh, thank you.
Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side, I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- Are these all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, I-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
I don't know what to show you.
Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen... this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
(Mark) Switch it off?
(Helen) No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- I wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
(Father) 'That will do, Mark.
'Dry your eyes and stop being silly.'
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how did it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
Not mine.
Won't you try to explain?
- You'd better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You'd better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye...
to my mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this - her funeral.
And this - her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
He was brilliant.
A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
(Knock on door)
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
(Director) Cut!
(Speaker-phone) 'Look, Mr Jarvis, this picture's a commercial proposition.
'That's why I want you to do it - it's your type of thing you so do well.
'I've talked to Johnnie already and he's crazy to do it...'
These are the figures you wanted, Mr Jarvis.
(Man on speaker-phone continues) 'This script is gonna...'
Still behind schedule.
'And you know that Paramount want it.
'Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.'
- But is it commercial?
- 'Anglo want it.'
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's OK.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be!
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- OK.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
I'm meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favourite stand-in today?
- Standing it.
(Assistant director) 8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
Well, where are you?
(Distant voice) Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
We're using their power.
We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
They won't come in.
They'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
Hmm.
Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
"You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
- Do you mind if I warm up?
- Go ahead.
(Rhythmic music plays)
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
(Camera whirrs)
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's going to put me in there?
Yes, Viv.
Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine...
this would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
That.
Mark!
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Mark!
(Screams) Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news - unless you want the football results.
Hmm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
He's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
(Knock on door)
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
I won't be long!
(Mr Lewis) 'I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... 'for their valuable contributions:
'Professor A. D. Smith of New York University,
'Mr.
Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... 'and Mark Lewis, my son...'
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
Happy birthday.
Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really...
It isn't much.
I-I don't know anything about 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
Please.
Oh, Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm going to put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Um... the first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
(Heavy ticking)
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- I n my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
- Some short stories.
I'd like to read them.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
What is it about?
A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take.
- I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- I'll take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I photograph for nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Er, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
And ask... excuse me a second, darling for a white one, then when he brings the white one.
Then you ask for a different one...
This one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just DO it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
Who?
Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
(Director mumbles instructions)
(Muttering continues) Carrying your bag...
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, head up, and tight in to him there.
Very good.
(Screams)
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
(Bell rings)
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass by my place.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
To collect your kid's autograph book?
That's it, Chief.
If the nipper finds out where I've been...
All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
What about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him, but he was carrying something she couldn't see.
Oh, that's a help (!
)
Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
What was it she saw?
Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone.
So we'll try not to interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, er, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
Have you been filming those policemen?
Mmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
Documentary, eh?
What's it about?
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished... and it will be soon.
Suppose they catch you?
Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
Mark, you're next.
Don't get into trouble.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
(Knocks on door)
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
I don't know if she heard me.
- What did you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
Oh?
Where?
Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
(Phone rings)
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell him.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- All right, sir.
Gotcha!
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- OK.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned him.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
No doubt at all - the wounds caused by the same instrument.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
What sort of shock?
That's up to you to find out, Inspector.
It's not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes, I have finished.
Come on, fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
(Music plays)
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
(Cartoon voice) I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get him quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
(Helen reads) "She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
"The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
"A spokesman said that her performance showed such promise...
"that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling.
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of him.
Where is he taking you?
I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
- (Pounding heartbeat)
- Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
I didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Nothing.
Thank you very much.
Mother, I've left your supper...
Tell me, young man, which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Good night.
Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
- That camera.
Oh.
I...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
What does your magic camera photograph?
People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
(Heavy ticking)
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment...
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
That's what I was going to say, what a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, your magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- Oh, he will wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
(Clatter)
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
I can't get used to them.
I-I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- N-Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
I'd never know.
You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
(Mark walls)
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
(Camera whirrs)
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't...
don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I-I won't be selfish.
You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you...
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Er, yeah.
Yeah.
OK.
(Whispers) Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
I heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy.
I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... (Sneeze) ...of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Looking for a hat, madam?
Yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Um, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
(Agitated voice) In red?
Have you one in blue?
(Screaming) In blue.
In blue!
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
(Indistinct)
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in... before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
I can't wait to show you this.
I should charge you.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Mmm, she's terrific.
I've got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Yeah, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
About what?
- Voyeurism.
- Eh?
What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
I can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
it might be my only chance.
Well, be here at six o'clock, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- Six o'clock.
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Have you got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on manoeuvres with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
I didn't stand up my gentleman friend and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street!
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
It might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
- To leave something for Mark.
You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
- It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
See you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
(Whispers) Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
(Phone rings)
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
I must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
(Frantic screaming)
Aged five.
(Sobbing and wailing)
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
(Laughter and chatter)
Your room.
(Flicks switch)
(Woman's slurred speech)
Your mother's.
(Glass breaks)
(Flicks switch)
Tony's.
(Tony) 'No one will come in.'
(Helen) 'I don't care.' (Tony) 'But, darling.'
- 'Tony, stop it!
' - 'The door is locked.'
'I don't care.
I'm scared.'
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
(Echoing scream)
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
I'm frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- OK, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
Give yourself up, Mark!
I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
(voices outside)
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
(Symphony of wailing)
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No, Mark!
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
(Battering at door)
The girl's alive.
Go and get an ambulance.
(Professor Lewis) 'All right, all right.
Don't be a silly boy.
'There's nothing to be afraid of.'
(Mark) 'Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- No.
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, l-I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
I
- I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, l-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and l-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, l-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
her funeral.
And this:
her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
Won't be long!
I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I
- I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
I
- I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, Madam.
Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned 'im.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
L-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H
- How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
L...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
Oh, he'll wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- L...
I feel at home here.
I
- I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- L...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I
- I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
L-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I
- I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I
- I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- I didn't stand up my gentleman friend... and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Indistinct] - [Ringing]
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- Here.
Open this one.
Your mother's.
- Tony's.
- No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- I don't care.
- But, darling.
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.
I don't care.
I'm scared.
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
Frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
Girl's alive.
Go get an ambulance.
All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- No.
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiancé saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
# Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Helen #
# Happy birthday to you ##
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I-I mustn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
I-I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, I-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
Her funeral.
And this:
Her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
Won't be long!
I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
I-I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- and ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry.
For a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, Madam.
Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned 'im.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
I-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
I...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
Oh, he'll wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I-I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of...
Of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
I-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- I didn't stand up my gentleman friend...
And come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- Here.
Open this one.
Your mother's.
- Tony's.
- No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- I don't care.
- But, darling.
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.
I don't care.
I'm scared.
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
Frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
Girl's alive.
Go get an ambulance.
All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
Ripped by:
SkyFury
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- No.
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
- Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll-I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
-
- It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
- A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, l-I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
l-I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, l-I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and l-I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, l-I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this:
her funeral.
And this:
her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
- Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
- Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
- Won't be long!
I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
l-I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
l-I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, Madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
- Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned 'im.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
L-I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
- Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
- The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
- Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
L...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my...
my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
- Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
- Oh, he'll wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- L...
I feel at home here.
l-I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- L...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
- Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
l-I won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- h, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
L-I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
- Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her...
psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
- I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
l-I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
l-I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
- Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- I didn't stand up my gentleman friend... and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
- Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
- Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- Here.
Open this one.
- Your mother's.
- Tony's.
- No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- I don't care.
- But, darling.
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.
- I don't care.
I'm scared.
- Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
- When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
Frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
Girl's alive.
Go get an ambulance.
All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
Peeping.Tom.1960.CRiTERiON.DVDRip.XviD-C00LdUdE
It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- No.
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh.
The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on.
Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly.
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I...
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
I'll
- I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes.
Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh?
When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there?
A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow!
One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello.
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap
- Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I...
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I
- I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life.
I
- I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no.
He
- He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I
- I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I
- I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm
- I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It
- It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his?
No, I
- I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this: her funeral.
And this: her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to...
to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already.
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
- ... way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action!
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
Cut!
How was it?
Phil?
Sam?
Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh.
I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on.
Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra?
Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he?
Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones...
feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark.
I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well.
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir.
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you...
go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes, I won't even finish this.
Done.
Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
Won't be long!
I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I
- I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
I
- I don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
I...
I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F
- From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But...
But Helen, th- that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What...
Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W
- What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes.
I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand?
What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- No, Phil.
I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right.
Ready?
Action.
- Here we are, Madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Do you remember doing it?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression.
It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?
What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh?
Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir.
Just my...
Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell him.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned him.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes.
I
- I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get him quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh.
Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of him.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know.
I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H
- How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh.
I...
I don't think I know.
Exactly.
I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my... my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
Famished!
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
Oh, Helen.
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
Oh, he'll wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I
- I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I
- I won't be selfish.
You
- You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No.
No.
You...
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I...
I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh
- Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you?
You know.
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as...
Oh, please!
- All right.
Clear the set!
Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes.
I
- I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red?
In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue.
In blue.
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No.
Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No.
I mean to help her... psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I
- I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I
- I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me... an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to...
Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But...
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
Lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts?
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
I didn't stand up my gentleman friend... and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going?
You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No.
I don't think so either.
All right, sir.
I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes.
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- Here.
Open this one.
Your mother's.
- Tony's.
- No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- I don't care.
- But, darling.
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.
I don't care.
I'm scared.
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I...
I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throat,
and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
Frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right.
He's there!
All right.
Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen!
Helen!
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
Girl's alive.
Go get an ambulance.
All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.

- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies ?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
- Exactly. lt's just the same with the work you do for me.
- [ Door Opening ]
Look busy.
- The Times, please.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir ?
- And the Telegraph.
[ Man ] Anything else ?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir ?
- Hmm ?
Well--
This sort, sir ?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.

Oh, well, I'll have that one.
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
[ Chuckling Nervously ]
- How much would the lot be ?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph.
How's that ?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.

Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night ?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh ?
When ?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiancé saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show ?
- Well, can you ?
- l think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again.
What have you got under there ?
A girlfriend ?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine ?
He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea ?
What sea ?
- l just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you ?
Well, if you want it again, I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it ?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living ?
- Take pictures.
- This sort ?
No, Milly.
[ Knock On Door ]
- On the house.
- [ Milly ] Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
- [ Door Closes ] - lt's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- l want to.
- What about the customers ?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.

What's that ?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
[ Chattering Continues ]
I say.
Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello. I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- l'm Mark.
- Pardon ?
- l am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in.
You'll meet the others who live here and--
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark ?
- Come on, Helen.
The cake.
Everyone's waiting.
Hap-Happy birthday.
[ Knock On Door ]
[ Knock On Door ]
- [ Knocking Continues ]
- A minute.
[ Knocking Continues ]
Oh l-- l hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so... I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, l-l mustn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you--
- Oh, thank you.
- l'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- l haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside ?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here ?
- Nearly all my life.
l-l was born in this house.
- Oh ?
-lt's my father's.
-Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is ?
Your father ?
Well, no.
He-He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You ?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- l haven't.
- Oh, l-l meant-- l know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and l-l'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do ?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- l hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films ?
- Yes.
- Of yours ?
- Yes.
- l'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it ?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm-l'm sure you're too busy and--
Will you--
- Would you like to see them now ?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
is that better ?
But it's enormous.
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
- What are these ?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well-- lt's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours ?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this ?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- lt-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh ?
- What was he ?
- A scientist.
Oh.
Then this equipment was his ?
No, l-l sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh !
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark ?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you ?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he ?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film ?
- [ Mark ] My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil--
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye ?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after ?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- [ Mark ] Switch it off ?
- [ Helen ] No.
No.
Again ?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it ?
No, Helen.
[ Screams ] What's that ?
- Mark, what are you doing ?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No.
No.
Please help me to understand this thing.
[ Man's Voice ] That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about ?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a--
A li--
Well, how'd it get there, Mark ?
How did it get there ?
Was it a pet ?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain ?
- You better go.
- l'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night ?
You better go.
Mark, what's this ?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that ?
Yes.
And this:
her funeral.
And this:
her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that ?
Her successor.
Successor ?
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
is that your father ?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing ?
Giving me a present.
What is it ?
Can't you guess ?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark !
Mark, switch it off !
Let's get out of here.
Mark ?
So, he was a scientist ?
What kind of a scientist, Mark ?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you ?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you ?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to-- to fear.
Fear ?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it ?
[ Knock On Door ]
Excuse me, but--
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if--
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
[ Man ] Cut !
[ Man On Phone ] Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already. I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna--
- Still behind schedule.
- ...way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah.
Paramount want it.
MGM want it.
Columbia want it.
- [ Jarvis ] But is it commercial ?
- [ Man ] Anglo want it.
[ Jarvis ] Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned ?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- [ Director ] We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it !
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more, I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- [ Director ] All right.
Quiet, everybody.
All right.
Action !
No, no, no, no, no.
Cut it.
Cut it.
Cut it. lt's hopeless.
[ Gasps ]
- Oh, miss.
- [ Director ] Cut !
- Cut !
How was it ?
Phil ?
Sam ?
Mark ?
Print it !
Hold take one.
- Okay.
Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls.
Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning.
You're wonderful, darling.
You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus ?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh. I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then ?
- l hope so.
-How's my favorite stand-in today, huh ?
-Standing it.
[ Director ] 8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home ?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then ?
That Indian picture, The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you ?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind.
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.

Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know.
They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- l've put the red light on.
- You've what ?
- l've put the red light on.
Would you--
- But--
Would you please stand over there ?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference ?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter ?
- Oh, matter !
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.

- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.

What is it you want me to act ?
Being frightened to death ?

Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it ?
They can only hang you once.

Ever stood behind one ?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark.
Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir. I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing ?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- l've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please ?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there ?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, l-- l hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number ?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv ?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death ?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman ?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that--
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That ?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it ?
That ?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.

- Do you like him ?
- Yes.
- Why ?
- Well, he has a quality.
[ Scoffs ] I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen ?
- Yes ?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you ?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else ?
- What else matters ?
- Don't you like Mark ?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not ?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
-His footsteps aren't.
They're stealthy.
-Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him ?
- May I ?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise.
Off you go.

[ Man's Voice ] I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
l-l hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to--
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
l-l don't know anything about... 21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk ?
- More ?
- Milk ?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or-- or there ?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh.
Oh, no.
l-- l promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F-From me ?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- ln my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr-- l write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published ?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But-
- But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.
-What is it about ?
-A magic camera and what it photographs.
What-
- Whatever made you think of that ?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W-What does it photograph ?
- l'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no.
Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- and Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- you'll discuss it with me ?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- l'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- photograph for nothing.
- l didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend ?
- Then you'll talk it over with me ?
- When, please ?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night ?
- Yes.
- l hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[ Ringing ]
- Looking for a trunk ?
- Uh, yes. I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you ?
You see, that instead of taking the first trunk, I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that, I want you to look around...
-and ask-- excuse me a second, darling-- -[ Woman ] Sorry.
for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one-- this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- [ Michael ] I'll keep it light.
- l'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag l'll think of in a minute.
- Understand ?
What ?
- l don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it !
- All right.
Positions, everybody.
- [ Man ] Anyone seen Viv ?
- [ Director ] Who ?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.
- [ Director ] No, Phil. I want to run it first.
- [ Man ] All right, quiet.
[ Director ] All right.
Ready ?
Action.
- [ Michael ] Here we are, Madam.
- [ Diane ] Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
[ Director Muttering ]
Do you remember doing it ?
Right.
Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white ?
Certainly, Madam.
[ Director ] There's a white one there behind you.
Right here.
Again.
Good, Michael.
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue ?
- Certainly, Madam.
[ Director ] That's it, and back you go.
[ Continues, indistinct ]
That's it.
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right.
When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
[ Screams ]
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
[ Bell Ringing ]
- Excuse me, Chief ?
- Mmm ?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment ?
- To collect your kid's autograph book ?
- That's it, Chief.
- lf the nipper finds out where l've been--
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me.
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs ?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw ?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm. I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what ?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression. lt's exactly-- - l know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- [ Mark ] Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what ?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next.
Don't look so scared.
They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- l've been watching you.
- Oh.
-Have you been filming those policemen ?
-Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- lt's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what ?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for ?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh ?
What's it about ?
- Mmm.
- Hmm ?
- What's it about ?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you ?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind ?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy ?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice ?
- [ Woman ] Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
- [ Knock On Door ]
- Come in !
Mr. Lewis ?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief ?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us ?
- l don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl ?
- Yes, sir.
- How well ?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her ?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her ?
- l called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then ?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh ?
Where ?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you ?
No, sir.
Just my-- Just my camera.
[ Ringing ]
Sergeant Miller.
Right.
I'll tell 'im.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right.
You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, Mr. Lewis ?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you ?
- Yes.
The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right.
That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute !
Direct me to that set of yours, would you ?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
[ Door Closes ]
I warned 'im.
[ Man, indistinct ]
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
?
[ Whistling ]
- No doubt at all.
Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock ?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body ?
- Yes. l-l have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on ?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
?
[ Snapping Fingers ]
Baxter !
- [ Clicks ]
- Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- [ Miller ] Right.
[ Pens, Pencils Landing ]
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet !
[ imitating Tweety Bird ] I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get 'im quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we ?
[ Helen ] "She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing in, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister--
- Mark is in films, isn't he ?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav--" - l wonder if he knew her.
- l'll ask him tonight.
- Oh. ls he taking you out ?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm.
That's very chivalrous of 'im.
- Where is he taking you ?
- l have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at ?
- l don't know. I'll ask him.
- lf he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you ?
- l feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window ?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there ?
- The back of my neck told me.
- [ Chuckles ]
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free ?
Good.
So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H-How do you do, Mrs. Stephens ?
Hello, Mark.
- Have you been running, young man ?
- [ Sound Of Pulse Pounding ]
Yes.
Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like ?
- Uh, nothing.
Thank you very much.
- Hmm.
Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper-- which studio do you work at ?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work ?
- [ Helen ] Brookwood, I think.
- [ Mrs. Stephens ] Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper ?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
- [ Chuckles ]
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early.
Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes ?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that ?
- Without what ?
That camera.
Oh. l-- l don't think I know.
Exactly. I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight ?
Well, are you ?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too ?
- l'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you.
It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my-- my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark ?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I ?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and l--
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- l feel--
- Yes ?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel ?
Famished !
- Hmm.
Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- lt's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- ls it ?
- Yes.
There aren't too many open then.
- No.
- Sounds fun.
- [ Vehicle Departing ]
- Helen ?
- Yes ?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph ?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were--
Where is this restaurant ?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
[ Ticking ]
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- lf you catch it at the right moment.
[ Laughing ] Oh, Helen. I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh.
Mother must have gone to bed.
-Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
-Eh--
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance.
Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not ?
- lt will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph, I always lose.
I don't understand.
- [ Door Slams ]
- Oh, he'll wake Mother.
[ Water Running ]
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films ?
Well, l-- l've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which l--
Faces which--
[ Door Shuts ]
[ Door Slams ]
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you--
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
[ Stammers ] I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- ls there something you--
- A talk.
- Next door would be more-- - l-- l feel at home here.
l-l visit this room every night.
Visit ?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at ?
What's the film you're showing now ?
Why don't you lie to me ?
- l'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark ?
Why don't you answer ?
Oh !
[ Crying ] lt's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What ?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- l-- l have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled ?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing ?
Mark ?
Where are you ?
Where are you ?
Why are you putting that light on my face ?
Mark ?
- [ Film Rolling ]
- Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "lt's for Helen" ?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away !
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you ?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You--
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
l-l won't be selfish.
You-You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not ?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen ?
No.
No.
You-
- You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you ?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark ?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, l-- l might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate l had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her, I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
l-- l promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture ?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you ?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to !
[ Clock Ticking ]
- [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Children Chattering ]
Now over here.
Swing over on me.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
First positions, everybody.
Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil ?
- [ Phil ] Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
[ indistinct Chatter ]
Hey !
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
[ Man ] All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- lt's simply just-- Do you mind standing--
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex ?
- lt's the detective, sir.
Oh-Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of--
[ Man Sneezing ] of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you ?
You know.
- [ Michael ] Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave.
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as-
- Oh, please !
- All right.
Clear the set !
Please, makeup.
-Now, take it easy, darling.
Just relax.
-All right.
All right.
And camera !
Hat, madam ?
Yes. l-l'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red ?
Certainly, madam.
In red ?
In red ?
Have you one in blue ?
In blue. ln blue.
[ Screaming, Crying ]
Ye gods !
- Break for half an hour, sir ?
- No.
Break forever !
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up.
Back in half an hour.
- [ indistinct ]
- Hmm ?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something ?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No. I mean to help her-- psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst !
What's your job ?
- l'm... a focus puller.
- ?
[ Man Whistling ]
Oh.
So am I, in a way.
- l wonder--
- Hmm ?
I wonder if you knew my father, Professor Lewis ?
- A--
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant !
Quite brilliant !
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died ?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
l-l don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what-- what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto--
- Philia.
The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day.
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left ?
- l thought it could be cured.
- Usually.
Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure.
Oh, very quick.
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left ?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
l-l'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- l wonder what all that's about ?
- l don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
[ Sneezing ]
[ Man ] Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me...
an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- ls that all he wanted ?
I think so.
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to-
- Voyeurism.
- About what ?
- Eh ?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and--
Peeping Tom ?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you ?
I suspect them all.
- [ Director ] Action !
- What about you ?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But-
- But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- 6:00 ?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- l'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant ?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones ?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- l won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at ?
Haven't you seen a key before ?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
-And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
-Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea ?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why ?
Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts ?
Now what are you doing ?
- l thought so.
- Come on.
We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the-- [ Sighs ]
- [ Clicks ]
- Have you gone completely crazy ?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
- l didn't stand up my gentleman friend...
- [ Clicks ] and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder ?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
[ Bell Rings ]
[ Door Slams ]
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going ?
You--
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, l-- lt's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother ?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course.
Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
[ Knocking ]
Mark ?
Mark ?
[ Whispers ] Mark.
[ Liquid Dripping ]
- [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Children Shouting ]
[ Dripping Continues ]
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir ?
No. I don't think so either.
All right, sir. I'll give you the details when I get back.
Bye, sir.
[ Gasping ]
[ Whimpering ]
[ Screams ]
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave.
Hurry up !
- No !
Leave !
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film--
That film is... just a film, isn't it ?
It's horrible.
Horrible.
But it's just a film, isn't it ?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
- [ TV:
indistinct ] - [ Ringing ]
[ Lowers Volume ] Inspector Gregg.
What ?
Put him on the line.
Peters here.
Yes. I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address ?
Newsagent's shop !
[ Mark, Breathing Heavily ] Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
[ Child Screaming ]
- Aged five.
- [ Screaming Continues ]
[ Child Crying ]
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
- [ Woman Laughing ]
- Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- [ Man ] Here.
Open this one.
- [ Mrs. Stephens, indistinct ]
- Your mother's.
[ Glass Clinking ]
- Tony's.
- [ Tony ] No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- [ Woman ] I don't care.
- [ Tony ] But, darling.
- [ Woman ] Tony, stop it !
- [ Tony ] The door is locked.
[ Woman ] I don't care. I'm scared.
- Turn it off.
- [ Clicks ]
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me !
What did you do to those girls ?
- No.
- What did you do ?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls ?
l-- l can't.
Show me.
[ Sobbing ]
But if you're frightened--
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me !
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is ?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
- [ Woman Screaming ]
- When they felt the spike... touching their throat, and knew I was going to kill them, I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
[ Whimpering ] Frightened for you.
[ Siren Blaring ]
[ Continues ]
[ Tires Squealing ]
- Got the men all right ?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- [ Glass Breaking ]
- Look out !
- lt's only a camera.
- Only ?
- Give yourself up, Mark !
- l've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing ?
- That's all right.
[ Men Yelling ]
[ Miller ] All right.
He's there !
All right.
Come on, then !
I can beat that.
[ Cries, Screams Overlapping ]
Give yourself up, Mark !
[ Crying ]
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen !
Helen !
I'm afraid.
No.
No.
Mark.
[ Sobbing Hysterically ]
[ Thudding ]
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
[ Grunting ]
[ Coughs, Gasping ]
[ Moans ]
[ Men Grunting ]
Girl's alive.
[ Tapes Continue ]
Go get an ambulance.
[ Dr. Lewis ] All right.
All right.
Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
[ Young Mark ] Good night, Daddy.
Hold my hand.
The Loves of Hercules
Forward!
Do not spare anyone!
Help!
Quickly!
We must leave!
- Are you Megara?
- Yes, I am.
Who are you?
If you want our money, our flocks...
They can take everything we have!
But spare the lives of these people!
- It's your life that interests us.
- Mine'?
Why?
You have the misfortune of being the wife of Hercules.
By killing you, I destroy what he loves most in this world.
No!
No!
Assassin!
Coward!
Let me go!
Have mercy!
Hercules... will avenge my death...
That is my hope, as well.
But his vengeance will fall on the person I wish to destroy.
- Well?
- Your orders have been carried out.
I've executed all your commands.
Well done, Licos!
I would like to be here tomorrow to witness the bitter torment of Hercules!
His pain will be so great he will wish that he had been killed, himself.
Perhaps, but his wish will only follow his revenge.
When he finds out the truth, he will destroy us all.
How would he find out?
He knows all who are his enemies.
And now it's you that he hates the most.
We can not turn back now.
Most certainly.
- But there's still a solution.
- What?
Hercules will only be appeased... if he believes the killer of his wife is dead!
Traitor!
Now that it's done, how will we explain to the populous and Deianira?
The people believe that we came here for just reasons...
And will be proud to know their king fell like a hero in battle.
And Deianira thinks of me as a trusted adviser and devotee of her father... and will continue trusting me while Hercules... attempts to sate his thirst for revenge on the entire House of King Eurytus!
Oracle, you who see the truth in the shifting sands, in the moving tides of the sea, in the flight of birds across the skies,
You, to whom the stars reveal their secrets
And the fates disclose the mysteries we mortals see only in our admonishing dreams,
Tell me, have the gods been placated at last?
If after endless trials I shall have peace?
Hercules, I see the ocean in madness,
I see a raft being dragged along in the wake of a mighty vessel.
This vessel is the divine wrath of the gods you brought upon yourself by killing the sacred serpent of the Goddess Hera!
Your whole life will be as this raft.
Swept by wind and wave, tossed by the tempest.
What new sufferings have I yet to bear?
The mist returns.
All is obscured by a fog of blackness!
Speak!
I beg you!
Tell me what will be my fate!
- Hercules!
Hercules!
- Iolaus!
What happened?
Something... terrible!
- Who hurt you?
- We were attacked.
Our camp was burned to ashes!
everyone's dead.
Everyone?
Yes, even Megera.
Who was it?
Speak!
Who was it?
King Eurytus!
We will never know peace again.
Blood will demand blood til the end of the world
And our vengeance will, in turn, breed vengeance.
Megara...
I should never have left you alone, without my protection.
Forgive me.
Why?
Why are the gods again persecuting me with their wrath?
Killing everything that I love.
- What will you do?
- I'm going to Ecalia.
What?
Alone?
Eurytas has a strong army!
You'll never even get inside the city gates!
No, I do not want war with Ecalia.
Eurytas is my only enemy!
I will give him the opportunity to defend himself.
But if he is possessed of too much cowardice...
I'll ask the people for the trial of Themis.
- I 'll go with you!
- No.
Stay here.
Take care of Iolaus.
Hercules!
- Hercules is coming!
- He's coming to attack us!
Inside the walls!
Hercules has arrived!
He came lo kill us all!
Save yourselves!
- Close the gates!
- Quickly!
Open the gates!
I want to speak to your king!
Do you hear me'?
Open the gates!
Fall back, fall back!
Quiscly!
Come on!
Hercules has forced the city gates!
There's nothing more to do.
If you wish, we are all ready to defend you to the last man!
It would be a useless sacrifice.
Hercules came to Ecalia to kill my father.
I inherited his throne, and also his mistakes.
It my duty to meet Hercules alone.
- And what will you do'?
- I told you, priest!
I intend to entrust my life to his clemency.
The people will demand you face the ultimate challenge... the Trial of Themis, the goddess of Justice.
To save my people I will gladly face the supreme challenge.
I am ready.
- Who are you?
- Deianira, daughter of Eurytus.
Where's your father?
Why has he sent you?
My father is dead.
- Dead?
- Yes.
My father paid with his life for the death of your wife.
I've ordered my people not to fight.
If you want revenge, kill me, but spare my people.
They are innocent!
Your people have nothing to fear.
And it will not be against an unarmed woman that I will fulfill my revenge!
Even if you are the daughter of man I hated most in life.
Your generosity condemns me to something perhaps more cruel than death.
- You mean the Trial of Themis?
- Yes.
The goddess of justice and retribution must be satisfied.
My people demand it.
Just take a look.
My people fear the wrath of the gods more than the anger of men.
Follow me.
I can not be the executioner the queen!
This is nonsense!
If you refuse... a soldier will be chosen by lots to perform the test.
If Deianira is not put to the trial Themis... the populous would no longer recognize her as their queen.
And she would be responsible for all future calamities... which befell the people of Ecalia.
My beloved lady, do not do this!
It's absurd!
You are innocent!
The gods will help me.
I must pay so my father's guilt can be expiated.
We are ready.
Are you still willing to face the supreme lest?
Yes I'm sure the Goddess Themis will guide the hand of Hercules.
Her life is in your hands.
It is impossible!
Nobody has ever survived this test!
Hercules has overcome challenges much more difficult than this.
Stay quiet.
Do you want another man to take your place?
No!
If the gods are just, I must succeed!
Did you see that'?
Hercules cannot possibly miss!
Watch this!
He's going to throw the second!
I cannot look!
I cannot!
- It's not over yet.
- She fainted!
- It's horrible!
- Do not be afraid, we are near the end.
In a moment, your mistress will be saved, you'll see!
Zeus, my father!
Help me!
How dare you?
It looks like your plan is a failure.
We must gather immediately in the conference room.
Deianira... oh, my lady!
Now that Hercules has saved the queen from an almost certain death... our whole perspective has changed.
Hercules has now become a greater threat.
No longer as an enemy, but now as a friend.
What do you mean?
The heroes tend to be loyal and generous when they encounter... sensitive characters such as our queen.
Her gratitude could move her to much deeper sentiments.
Do you understand the risk?
Deianira must remain faithful to her cousin!
She was promised to Acheloo by her father before the gods.
And it is my sacred duty as High Priest to see to it that this vow is fulfilled.
None of us must interfere for the time being.
Acheloo should be sent for immediately!
As her intended husband, he must be given every chance to defend his rights.
My lady, your new gold-braided gown is ready.
I thought that one would please Hercules.
Oh?
Do you know the tastes of Hercules?
I?
No.
Elea told me!
- Elea?
- Yes.
Elea has ways of knowing many things about Hercules.
In fact, she said he has lost his heart.
Enough!
Do not talk nonsense!
- Where is Elea?
- Outside, in the garden.
She's with Tamato, one of the two squires of Hercules.
The younger, course!
Forgive me, my lady.
I was collecting flowers and...
Do not lie, I know where you were.
I see!
So you just had to tell.
You are a snake!
What harm have I done'?
ls it shameful to be in love?
- After all, he is a squire of Hercules...
- Quiet!
You may all go now.
Elea, you stay.
Deianira, I have no idea what they may have told you... but I feel I may really be in love with that man.
I know by the look in your eyes that you speak the truth.
I wish you every happiness.
And you, mistress, have you found yours, as well?
No.
You're free and you can give your affection to anyone.
- If I were queen, I...
- If you were queen... your fate would be as mine.
You would also be bound to marry out of duty...
Even if in your heart you loved another.
I have matters to attend to.
It is now obvious that Deianira has fallen in love with Hercules.
And I have every reason to believe she will fail to keep her vow.
When Acheloo arrives here he will eliminate... any connection between Deianira and Hercules, I'm certain.
How can you be certain?
Acheloo is a hot tempered young man, impulsive and passionate.
He will not hesitate to challenge Hercules.
You're not expecting Acheloo to able to kill the son of Zeus, himself?
No.
In all likelihood, the one to perish will be Acheloo.
Don't you agree?
Ah.
I see.
So you are expecting Hercules to kill Acheloo.
I'm not only expecting it but his murder is something I count on!
Deianira will hate the man who kills Acheloo.
It's she who will have him banished.
And our beloved queen will remain alone.
And through her, we can seize Ecalia!
Come, Hercules!
See!
Is it not a wonder?
This is my favorite place to stroll.
Yes, it's beautiful.
Very, very beautiful!
That's funny!
I come here everyday, but...
Today everything looks more beautiful.
They say that we feel this way when we're close to someone... who's heart speaks to our own heart.
We will continue our walk.
Come, Hercules.
It's late.
We do not want the night to catch us by surprise.
Help!
Will no one help me?
Have mercy on me!
He was murdered!
Slain!
Look!
It's the Queen!
- What's happened here?
- Alcion!
- He stole my herd of bulls!
- And attacked my husband, look!
- Alcion?
Who is he'?
- A monster.
For one whole year he's pillaged our villages and attacked our people.
And after each raid he hides himself in the most inaccessible places.
Many have tried to hunt him down but no one ever returned.
Yes, it's true!
He is like a curse upon us!
Raping our women, stealing our cattle... and slaying everyone he encounters!
Return to your homes before it gets dark.
The monster could return!
Look!
The cattle are running away!
- We'll never be able to gel them now!
- Seek shelter, it may be the monster again!
Hercules!
Hercules!
Do not cry, the danger is over.
How can I thank you?
You risked your life for me.
And I would again a thousand times if your life were in danger.
Since I met you I felt you were always mine.
I love you, Deianira.
- No... don't talk like that, please!
- But, why?
Before finding you, nothing in this world gave peace to my heart.
But you managed to make me forget the pain...
Revenge, hatred...
I love you, Deianira!
Oh, no...
Go away!
Wait.
There's something about you I can not understand.
You always run away from me.
As if you were afraid of me.
No, it's not that!
Since the first day I wanted to tell you, but...
Deianira!
Deianira, you do not seem very happy to see me.
No... on the contrary!
Some peasants just told me you were attacked by a bull. ls this true?
Yes.
I was about to be attacked, and I'd have been killed if it hadn't been for...
I'm Acheloo.
I appreciate you saving the life of my future wife.
Wife?
So, then, that is why...
I am displeased at your having kept our engagement from your friend.
Well, now you know!
So, you're getting married to this man?
Yes, we must get married.
It was the wish of my father.
Your father commited many errors in his life!
Among them, the choice of your husband!
- How dare you insult me?
- Acheloo!
Hercules, no!
Please do not kill him!
Release me!
- You're in luck!
- Acheloo!
I understand.
Deianira, I am leaving Ecalia!
- Tamanto!
- Hercules!
Come on!
What?
Quick!
Saddle the horses immediately, we need to go!
Hercules!
Why?
Until this morning, it seemed...
I did not think we would be leaving so soon.
Neither did I. I see that you do not waste time.
Excuse me, Hercules.
I'll leave, but...
But you found someone that interests you more than me.
No, no!
I'll leave immediately with you!
If you want to stay, I'll not try to stop you.
I'll see you after the wedding.
Oh, Deianira, I cannot bear to see you cry like this!
Yes, you're right, weeping is futility!
It's all useless!
Tears are not a Queen's privilege.
I don't understand why you do this.
Hercules loves you and you drove him away.
I was promised to Acheloo and I can not go back.
Because of that, it's better if Hercules left Ecalia forever.
Deianira!
Licos sent me!
Something terrible has happened!
- What's happened?
- Prince Acheloo has been assassinated!
Where?
Who did this?
No one knows, my lady.
He was found with a dagger in the back!
I recognize it.
This dagger belongs to Hercules!
Yes, I, too have seen it.
He carries it in his his belt.
- So this is why he fled.
- What are they saying?
I can scarcely believe it, either.
But this dagger leaves no doubt as to the murderer.
Look carefully at the handle.
Two serpents intertwined, the symbol of the god Mercury.
No one but Hercules possessed a dagger like this.
It can not be!
I will not believe it!
Why not?
He would have killed Acheloo today in the cabin... if you had not intervened.
So perhaps Hercules did have some motive to kill Acheloo.
What is it?
Do you know the motive?
Yes.
Perhaps.
- So what do we do now, Hercules?
- For tonight, we'll stay here.
- Tomorrow we will decide.
- Very well.
Hercules!
Tamanto, what is it?
Hercules, Acheloo has been murdered!
You rode all the way from the city to tell me that?
Yes, because they've set a trap for you!
They found your dagger thrust into his back!
MY dagger?
They all accuse you of having fled.
Everyone believes it!
And by now even Deianira is convinced!
Deianira...
Iolaus, prepare the horses as quickly as you can!
Hurry!
We have gathered here today in sorrow... for the blow fate has dealt us and our beloved queen.
This crime should not remain without comeuppance!
Already I can see the shadow of the sword of justice darkening the face of the assassin!
Death.
In the space of a few short months we have lost our King... and he who was to take his place as prince in mysterious circumstances.
Oh, noble and valiant Acheloo... you have entered into the Realm of the Underworld... leaving the throne destined for you vacant... and the queen a widow before marriage.
I swear on your deathbed that our hearts will not be appeased...
Until we have exacted just vengeance!
Licos!
What?
Why are not you at the ceremony?
I came back because of Hercules.
He's approaching the palace!
What do we do?
Nothing.
We will face the situation.
They'll suspect us!
It'll be our end.
Hercules will not have mercy!
Better leave town immediately.
Hide yourself!
But where?
Where?
The river.
Beside the Gorge of Nymphs.
No one will find you there.
And what will you do'?
You can not leave me!
Do not be afraid, I will follow you.
Your presence here is sacrilege!
How dare you commit such an outrage to the dead?
Far be it for me to commit sacrilege!
Acheloo, if you can hear me, I ask your testimony!
I have come here for justification of the charges that you have made against me!
It is not we who accuse you but your own dagger!
It was found embedded in the body of Aqueloo.
How could anyone suspect me of this cowardly act?
I have shown nothing but friendship to the people of Ecalia!
Hercules is right, Deinira.
Our grief should not prevent us from listening to Hercules with an open mind.
We all know him as a fair and righteous man.
Listen to him.
Yes.
You are right.
I will hear Hercules.
Speak!
You remember that I used my dagger to kill the charging bull?
Distracted by Acheloo's arrival, I forgot to retrieve it.
True.
And if I had not intervened, you would have killed him then!
Yes, but I did not kill him!
At that moment, I thought only to abandon Ecalia.
There was no longer any reason to stay.
Someone obviously used my dagger to make me look guilty!
But there were only two others, Acheloo and Filarete.
Yes, Filarete!
If Filarete an honorable man, he will testify in my favor!
- Where's Filarete?
- Bring Filaret immediately!
Filarete is gone.
I am responsible for his absence.
- And where did he go'?
- To the Gorge of the Nymphs.
With a good horse we could overtake him easily.
I will find him.
I'll bring him here!
I will throw him at your feet and he will confess the truth!
Filarete!
Filarete!
Two men crossed the river to the Gorge of the Nymphs...
On their way to the Cave of the Hydra.
Let us go see!
Be careful of the edge.
You can see them from here.
The monster is hurt!
Come, we must go and help them!
Who are you?
My name is Nemeea.
You're in the Land of the Amazons.
Tell me, what is your name?
- I am...
Hercules.
- Hercules?
Leona!
- Where is Queen Hippolita'?
- In the Forest of Death.
Today is the Epiphany of Democrito.
Go.
You need to alert her immediately.
Spare me, please!
Or kill me!
But do not condemn me to this agony!
Mercy!
Mercy!
Did he cry so when he was lying in your arms?
Save me, Hippolita!
By our love!
Save me!
In a few moments, there will be no more suffering.
Watch him!
Watch him!
He is almost transformed like all your other lovers!
We found a wounded man.
He has killed Hydra!
- Do you know who he is?
- Yes.
It is Hercules, son of Zeus!
- Son of Zeus?
Hurry!
- Yes!
Hurry!
Are you positive this man is Hercules?
I have no doubt, my queen, since I've seen him battle and defeat the Hydra.
- And he's still alive'?
- Yes, but he's lost a lot of blood.
Lacchesi!
You must cure him, do you understand?
I do not want him to die.
You know my potions are infallible...
But when I've cured his battle wounds, he will not be thankful.
Not in the way that you want.
You want him saved for an end which is much more atrocious.
No man has ever been allowed lo leave our domain alive!
Not even the son of Zeus can escape that law.
Lacchesi This man intrigues me!
You will do as I say!
Have you thought well on what you're doing?
You can not treat Hercules as you would other men.
He is the son of Zeus!
Are you saying the Queen Amazons is not worthy of the son of a god?
Hercules will never surrender to your charms... because another woman has possession of his heart.
Let him see me.
He'll be no different from the others.
No, do not think that, Hippolita.
You will not succeed.
If you really want him to love you, you must take the appearance... of the woman he loves.
- Not show my own face?
- There is no other way.
That's the most insulting price any woman could pay for love!
Then give up this idea!
Just cure him, Lacchesi!
L'll make his awakening so sweet he'll believe that he is dreaming.
Hercules has played with your emotions, Deianira.
Everything leads us to believe that Hercules given up... the attempt to prove his innocence.
But what became of Filarete'?
I do not understand why Hercules was looking for him?
If Filarete were guilty...
Hercules would have gone with him, as we said.
It is obvious that Hercules has played with your emotions.
He knows that if we cannot prove his guilt... you may continue to love him.
Impossible!
I could never love the killer of Acheloo!
That's enough!
Do not torment her any longer.
I just wanted Deianira to remember... there's a duty to be fulfilled by her for the people of Ecalia.
You should have married Acheloo.
Now you need to choose another to sit beside you on the throne.
Deianira knows what her duty is.
You can go now.
We will talk about this later.
I am sorry they are making themselves guardians of your conscience.
I would like you to forget all that makes you unhappy.
Thank you, Licos.
Yet, the problem of who you will share the throne with must be faced soon.
You are a woman.
And the weight of government is too heavy for you to bear alone.
Yes, I know.
I feel I'm losing strength.
Have you faith in me'?
- I have.
- Then put your hand in mine.
I have always been your trusted counselor.
Now let me be your trusted husband.
- You?
- Yes.
I understand your astonishment.
Forgive my boldness.
I have long loved you in silence...
And I'd have never opened my heart in other circumstances... because I had no chance.
Now, I just want to help you, and only...
For that reason do I dare speak.
Unless you do not consider me... worthy.
No...
I have always held you in great esteem.
There are so few people in whom I can trust.
But give me a little time to reflect.
Now I'd like to be alone, please.
I shall wait for your answer, Deianira.
We need to know at least where he is.
We've had no news Of Hercules for too long.
This is not the first time he has faced danger.
And he always returned.
Yes, but this time perhaps he might need us!
I do not know why, but I feel that something must have happened to him.
- You always think the worst.
- The gods do not like Hercules!
They enjoy seeing him face the greatest dangers!
Tamanto, I feel that if you go, you won't be coming back.
This conversation again?
At least promise me you'll be back soon!
Yes, my dear, I promise.
What are you doing?
I've never seen a woman so clingy!
- Come on!
- Do not worry!
I'll be back soon!
Take this.
Drink it.
With this potion, you will assume the likeness of Deianira precisely!
Believe me, Hercules will be mesmerized by you.
All other men have wanted me just as I am.
Yes, but you can not risk being rejected by him!
This is the only way to seduce him!
Hercules loves a woman he can not have.
With this elixir, you'll be able to fulfill his dream.
You'll have the same eyes, the same mouth...
The same body of that woman!
Hercules will be yours for as long as you desire!
I am grateful for your having cured me.
Now I must leave for Ecalia.
But first I would like to be received by Queen Hippolita... to thank her for her hospitality.
Hippolita desires to see you, as well.
What's the matter?
Why do you say it in such a way?
Once you lay eyes on her, you'll abandon all intention of leaving.
I cannot stay.
My honor is at stake!
I'm anxious to know what has happened in Ecalia in my absence.
Hercules...
You must be on your guard...
Why this attitude?
There is nothing to fear from anyone here.
Hercules!
Hippolita desires to see you!
Welcome news.
I will tell her that I must leave this very day.
- Be careful!
- What of?
A warning.
That is all.
That is all.
- Look!
Hercules goes to Hippolita.
- His time has come.
Hippolita, I'm glad you called.
I wanted to...
But you...
You are not Hippolita...
By this name I am known in my kingdom and beyond.
Is this really true?
Hippolita?
In the flesh, as true as you are Hercules.
The powerful, fearless destroyer of Hydra.
I hope you do not still suffer from your wounds.
There's a strange light in your eyes, Hercules.
What surprises you so that you cannot even thank me?
I will do so when I'm sure that I'm not dreaming.
- Incredible!
- What's incredible?
Explain yourself, Hercules!
The same voice, the same eyes...
- The same figure!
- No, you're not dreaming.
Do not go.
Accept my hospitality!
Impossible...
Impossible... incredible!
Incredible, impossible!
What is impossible?
You keep repeating these useless words...
And saying none that I want to hear.
Or did you imagine that I'd be more beautiful?
Ahh.
So it seems.
You judge that my beauty doesn't equal my fame, confess.
You're disappointed.
No, I swear, that's not it!
But I feel like I'm going mad!
Like I am in a dream.
And now that you are close to me...
Alive... in the flesh...
Whoever you maybe, Hippolita or Deianira...
You are the woman I want!
Gaze at me!
Caress me!
Kiss me!
My lips are yours!
lam all yours!
Look!
It's Filarete 's chariot!
Hercules has to be here!
You're right, they should be here!
Iolaus come here!
It's dead!
Only Hercules could kill a monster like this.
Look what I found!
This cloak belongs to Hercules!
If he were alive, he would not leave it here!
Maybe he's hurt.
Come, we must find him!
Iolaus!
This belongs to Filarete?
What could have happened?
I just realized something!
We must be in the realm of the Amazons!
No man who enters here is ever seen again!
What should we do?
We must return to Ecalia!
We need to inform Deianira!
Come on!
It's useless trying to pretend!
I know well that many in Ecalia are conspiring against us!
But I know what will tame them!
The whip!
Enough!
Tell me the name of your cohorts and you will be freed!
No!
I will not speak!
Those whom you call conspirators... are honest people who have suffered from your abuse and your injustice!
We only want to be governed by our true and lawful Queen!
Why not let me appeal to her for justice?
I'm in command of Ecalia!
Continue!
If he does not speak, you know what must be done.
- So, will you speak or not?
- No!
Kill me if you will, but I'll never talk!
Take this man away!
Where are you going to take me?
What are you going to do to me?
For the last time: will you give us this information we want'?
No!
This reign of torture and murder must cease if you wish to stay in power.
When I finally succeed in marrying Deianira...
You'll see that no one will dare oppose my authority.
However, it seems that the queen's not very willing to marry you.
She will accept.
I can be quite persuasive.
Don't you think the best way would be to win her heart?
Her sentiments have ceased to interest me.
It's her throne that I want!
Be careful, Licos!
You've already killed her father.
And you arranged the murder of Acheloo, Filarete, Hercules.
- Where will this thirst for blood take you?
- I've just told you!
To the throne!
Deianira's almost convinced of the guilt of Hercules.
Soon she'll come to me in desperation.
I was outside the door!
I heard everything!
But, do you realize the seriousness of your accusation?
It's true, I swear!
Licos is the killer of Acheloo and your own father!
If this is true, I will avenge them!
But you can't do it alone.
I beg you, let us go find Hercules!
Your life is in danger!
When Licos finds out you know all...
Are you forgetting I am still Queen of Ecalia?
Deianira!
Licos want to see you.
Forgive me, Deianira.
I must speak to you alone.
You may go.
Please forgive my insistence!
Your persistence is the fruit of your great love for me, is it not?
It seems you are looking into my heart.
You think the time has come for us to marry.
Yes.
That is my desire.
Of course!
As that's part of your plan.
What do you mean?
What plan?
- The plan that cost the life of my father!
- Everyone knows your father died in battle!
You traitor!
I know that you killed him!
And that it was you who killed Acheloo!
What are you saying?
The truth!
You've gotten rid of all those who would prevent you... from gaining power, and now if you could marry me... your victory would be complete!
This is absurd!
How could such thoughts enter your head'?
Because you said it yourself a moment ago to the high priest.
- So you were listening?
- You don't even bother denying it!
You will pay for your treason, Licos!
Guards, put this man under arrest!
Did you not hear my orders?
From now on, the guards will obey only me.
Government is not a woman's domain.
- I have tried to convince you of that.
- But I am the queen!
And queen you shall remain if you'll be my wife.
Better to die than to be your wife!
This is a foolish move.
You compel me to act against my wishes.
- What are you going to do?
- You will be taken to the dungeons.
And there you will remain until common sense regains control of your mind.
Take her away!
Go, Elea!
Take my advice and leave Ecalia before it's too late!
Oh, but it pains me to abandon my queen in her time of need!
You can do more good if you're free and far away!
If you remain here, Licos will have you arrested, as well!
But where could I possibly go?
Take a horse and look for exiles in the forest of Tendaro!
There you'll find refuge and people to help!
- And Deianira'?
- I'll look after her.
I am above suspicion.
- There's not a moment to waste!
- Now, hurry!
Hurry!
Elea!
Elea, where are you going?
Finally I found you!
Luckily I managed to stop you in time!
- You can no longer return to Ecalia!
- Why?
What's happened?
Licos has had Deianira thrown in the dungeon!
- I was forced to flee for my life!
- But why?
I'm in danger because I discovered that Licos... ls the killer Of Acheloo and King Eurytus!
- What's that?
- Quickly, we must flee from here!
If Licos overtakes us, he'll kill us all!
Come with us!
Do you think the Queen will spare Hercules?
No chance.
Hercules will suffer the same fate as the others.
Tell me, has Hippolita already determined the day of his death?
It will not be long.
Ne you "EVEN?
Yes.
I feel that you have changed my destiny.
My whole life has completely transformed... since I've met you.
It seems the gods have smiled on me...
At last.
Happiness knows no time.
It seems eternal...
Even if it only lasts a moment.
- What are you doing here?
- I beg of you, speak softly!
If Hippolita should discover us here she would have me killed.
- What are you saying?
- What I have to tell you will be hard to hear.
Until now, you have believed everything Hippolita has wished to tell you.
Through sorcery, she's taken possession of your heart, made you forget the woman you loved.
She made me forget the sadness of the past and gave me back the joy of living.
My fate was completely changed since I've been here.
Yet, if you knew the fate in store for you, you'd detest her with all your heart.
What do you mean?
I will be the first and only Amazon lo ever reveal the secret of her people.
But I can not remain silent while you go to that horrible end!
I must save you!
But I don't understand.
Have you gone mad?
Yes, perhaps it is madness to betray my queen.
But I do this only to keep you alive.
I will prove it!
Follow Me.
Then you will understand.
Do you mean that these lifeless trunks were once living men?
Yes, and more horrible still, they continue to live!
Look!
I break a twig and you see that blood flows!
Listen and tremble!
- And Hippolita was going to do this to me?
- Yes.
This fate awaits all who have loved her...
Once she grows tired of being loved by them.
How could I have been so blind...
And become so easily a victim of her spell?
But now, enough!
I must leave for Ecalia immediately!
Yes!
Leave this place before it's too late!
I will guide you to the edge of the forest.
There, you will find your horse.
Nemeea!
Nemeea!
- I can not let him escape.
- Hippolita!
Have no fear.
She cannot harm me now.
- Farewell!
- Quickly!
You're almost out of danger.
- I've been betrayed!
- What will you do?
Hippolita, wait!
You can not run among those trees!
Nemeea.
Nemeea!
Wait, Hippolita!
No!
Help!
Now you will die!
- Hippolita!
- Help!
You must die!
I warned you.
This is the punishment of Zeus!
' Help!
' Die!
Die!
Stop!
Why are you running away?
- Where are you going?
Why don't you answer me?
- He can't speak.
- They have torn out his tongue.
- Do you want to suffer the same fate?
Isn't your husband's suffering enough for you?
Keep walking.
Hey, you.
Why are you running away from Ecalia'?
What's happened?
The city is a hell for us now that the blood-thirsty Licos commands.
- Licos?
- Yes, he!
- And the queen... is she still alive?
- No one has seen her.
Her handmaiden, Elea, may have news of her.
- And where can I find her?
- She has taken refuge in the Forest of Tindaro.
Elea was the last person who saw the Queen alive.
It was Licos who assassinated the king!
He killed Acheloo and blamed you!
And now he's locked Deianira in the dungeon to compel her to marry him!
We sought you everywhere!
We found your cloak in hydra's cave...
Yes, and we were afraid you were dead!
There is no time to lose!
We must ride to Ecalia!
We must save the Queen!
Tamanto, if we return we won't have a chance!
This is madness!
What do you mean madness?
We must have courage.
Listen to them!
We are all returning together.
And that includes you!
You'll see, someone will come to free you.
Do not deceive me.
Don't give me false hope.
I feel too weak to resist much longer.
No, Deianira, you must not despair!
Last night I dreamed that Hercules had returned to Ecalia to free you!
Assassin!
Assassin!
Coward!
I curse you!
Usurper!
- The day will come for vengeance!
- You will be punished!
A curse upon you!
The gods will strike you down!
Oh, no, it's Licos!
- What does he want now?
- Courage!
You must try to outwit him!
You see, I have not forgotten you.
This is no place for you.
Again, the choice:
Either remain here or return to the throne.
At my side me, course.
I would rather die!
Get out!
Do not be stubborn.
I'm offering you your freedom and the same happiness and serenity as before!
Do not touch me, you disgust me!
You will regret this!
Licos!
Hercules is alive!
He's assembled an army and is marching on Ecalia.
Hercules?
It's not possible!
He has gathered all the exiles around him, all blind with their hatred for you!
They will be exterminated before they even reach the walls of Eclia!
Go give the order!
The gods have heard my prayer.
This is your end, Licos!
Do not be under illusions!
Nobody, not even Hercules, can save you!
Even if I should have to kill you with my own hands!
I told you that Hercules was alive!
Sound the alarm!
Hurry, everyone!
The gates must be closed!
Hercules is coming!
- Rioting has broken out in the streets, sir.
- The populous is all for Hercules!
So much the worse for them!
If they make it to the palace, exterminate them all!
Stand ready at your posts!
Prepare for battle!
Hercules will never even reach the gates.
His men will be decimated.
When people find that Hercules is near... they may decide to join him.
Our soldiers are stronger than that rabble.
Many soldiers have thrown away their weapons and will not fight against their brothers.
Execute a few as an example.
- The others will still not obey.
- They'll obey me or die!
It's the only way to control the uprising.
The city of Ecalia must be defended against Hercules at any cost.
Very well.
We come to save the Queen!
To the palace!
To the palace!
Attention!
Hercules has entered the city!
Hercules is coming!
Stand your ground, men.
Hercules has broken through our defenses.
He is already in the city!
It's impossible to stop him!
You must resist.
Redouble your efforts!
I know how to stop Hercules!
Lock all the doors!
Follow me to the dungeon!
- Release me, you coward!
- No!
You're coming with me!
- You'll never get away!
- Then you will die with me!
- Release me!
No!
No!
- Deianira!
Help me!
Release her, swine!
Get away from me!
Go the other way!
Hercules is coming with his men!
No!
Let me go!
Deianira?
Deianira!
Where is Deianira?
Where's Licos?
- I do not know, I swear!
- Speak out!
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!
I don't know!
For the last time...
Speak!
- He fled with Deianira.
- Where did they go?
Out that passage, to the river!
Free the prisoners!
Come with me, we must free the prisoners!
We're too late!
What happened to Deianira?
Do not despair, Hercules will find her!
Coward!
You coward!
Where are you taking me'?
You know you can't escape from Hercules!
We will see!
No!
No!
Help!
Help!
Hercules!
Let me go!
- Help me, Hercules!
- Keep quiet!
Deianira!
Come, hurry!
Help!
Help!
Hercules!
Oh, thank the gods, you saved me.
Please take me out of here!
THE END
Goodbye Persson, and good luck.
Thank you.
The evening newspapers, please.
- Yes.
- And Silver cigarettes.
Here you are.
May I have the change in pennies?
Of course.
Thank you.
Varlanda Station.
82 km to Stockholm.
"I go in for murder", says Stig Brender.
This one.
Yes.
When do you close?
We close at 1, but open again at 4.
I will be back before 1.
Thank you.
I'm looking for a hammer.
What size?
Normal.
Not too big.
It's for hanging up pictures.
This one, perhaps?
One size bigger.
The pictures are heavy.
A box of nails too?
You may have that already?
I have that.
How much is it?
Five crowns.
I don't need a bag.
I live nearby.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Hello, Raggen.
I'll be damned.
Long time, no see.
My name is not Raggen.
Isn't it Raggen Blomkvist?
The air force, at sea, the winter of 43...
No.
I could swear on it.
But if you're sure...
May I sit down?
I was about to leave.
Sit down, pal.
How about something invigorating?
I can fix that.
You're free to choose.
Nice prices too.
No thank you.
Look in the mirror, and you'll regret it.
10 crowns. 20... 30...
40... 50... and a hundred.
Thank you.
A tip?
Yes, 10%.
Alright, then.
What do you want?
A stiff drink, miss.
Not possible without ordering food.
I'll take that then.
Yes, hello?
Hello.
May I speak to director Stig Brender?
He isn't at home.
Who's asking?
Do you know where I might find him?
He is at a theatre rehearsal.
Can't be interrupted.
When is the rehearsal finished?
Impossible to say.
Probably late.
Please excuse me, a taxi is waiting.
I'm going to perform in a while.
Good evening.
Ladies and gentlemen, now a Swedish song that has become a hit:
'On a Bench In a Park'.
To meet and to split is part of the human condition.
Where and when one falls in love, nobody knows.
But suddenly one day the right one appears.
For me, it happened this way:
On a bench in a park, whilst the sun set.
And the twilight slowly fell.
He pulled me close.
He held me hard.
And my dream had finally come true.
On a bench in a park a loving couple sat, they forgot both time and space.
Ours hugs were long, our kisses many, and I wished time would stop.
In a happy moment, without beginning or end, on a bench in a park in April.
Sing everybody.
Kungsteatern.
Scene entrance.
Dean Cartwright Burial Company.
My company no longer has any use for you, Williams.
You had your opportunity, but failed.
We have nothing more to say to each other.
I did the best I could, Mr. Dean.
Possibly.
But it was not good enough.
I've written a letter to Scotland Yard, Mr. Dean.
You should read it before I send it.
It concerns your dealings on behalf of death, so to speak.
Nicke, start the tape recording.
Ready the gun.
Not that loud.
What's the volume?
About 2.
Set it to 6.
Make the gun click silently.
And fade the train sound out.
Stig, put down the gun first, and then put on the gloves.
Or else you'll leave fingerprints.
Of course, I'm sorry.
Must he hold the gun that close to my head?
Yesterday, I didn't hear a word during dinner.
You ought to be grateful for that.
It's important.
It's supposed to look like suicide.
There's such a thing as gunshot residue.
I think this whole thing is a bloody botch-up!
Dear Axel, don't make a fuss.
The premiere's in four days.
You know as well as I how much it matters to us.
Or do you prefer Höstsol next season?
Höstsol?
I can apply at Dramaten.
Fitting; they already call it 'the shelf for old men'.
Let's do another take.
Lie down and pretend you are dead.
Better that way.
That tone is unacceptable.
I've been at the theatre for 54 years.
I've starred with Gösta Fredrikson and Gerhard Lundekvist.
I was a friend of August Stringberg.
I don't give a damn about your murder botch-up.
So you heard that?
From the start I've been full of disgust about this cheap sell-out.
Which I thought was a bit below you, Stig.
I hereby resign.
Good night.
Axel, for God's sake, listen to me.
You know how much this show means to me.
One more fiasco and I must leave Kungsteatern.
After 12 years, 12 years of blood, sweat and tears.
Of both happiness and sadness.
This is my home.
Yours too.
Do you plan to betray that?
And right now?
I'm not used to such foul treatment.
We're all tired.
We have fiasco in our bodies
Rehearsals have suffered.
We've worked nights.
All of us are about to burst.
Axel, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
It just fell out of me.
You know I think you are an excellent actor.
I'll never forget your Benjamin in 'Påsk'.
No, I really hope not.
But you can't have seen it.
You weren't born then.
My mother told me about it.
She portrayed Kristina, as you remember.
She's described your performance in great detail.
That was some performance!
And what a portrayal.
Your mother's portrayal was also excellent.
Let's forget all about this.
Forget, and move on, as August said.
One thing is certain:
Not tonight.
It's half past 11.
Can't we go to Karlton?
I've got a feeling that a whisky won't hurt.
Some of us, that is.
The first sensible thing you've said all evening.
Do that.
Take those who want.
The bill's on me.
And you?
I've got a play to read.
Promised the publishers to tell them before rehearsal tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night, Stig.
Don't stay up too late.
Don't forget the gloves again, or the devil'll take you.
We meet at 10 tomorrow.
We start with act 2, and take act 1 last.
Write that on the board, Nicke.
And make sure everybody is notified.
Hello, darling.
How did it go tonight?
Overall, it went fine.
I think it may be a success.
Darling, don't say that word.
I'm frightened for you.
Shall I set out food for you?
There's no need.
I must finish reading a play.
It won't take long, but you needn't sit up and wait.
I'll get food myself.
Is there anything in particular?
No, nothing.
Wait.
A man called at 8 o'clock.
He didn't say what it was about nor his name.
I told him you were at the theatre.
Probably nothing important, then.
Sleep well, darling.
I'll try not to wake you.
See you tomorrow morning.
Oh, and don't burn the toast.
Bye.
Who is it?
It's me, Stickan.
Sampe.
You haven't forgotten me?
Your old schoolmate, Sampe.
I must speak with you.
It's important.
Enter.
Long time, no see.
That's true.
You're still the same.
Possibly.
You must excuse me.
I'm busy.
You can't stay long.
Thank you.
I'll be as swift as possible.
That's good.
Let's go to my office.
Take a seat.
Now, what's the matter?
Are you looking for a job?
No.
I'm just looking for you.
You, personally.
I've been reading about you in the papers.
But that's not quite the same.
You've really been successful, Stickan.
Please excuse my calling you Stickan.
Like before.
'Stig' sounds so formal, in a sense.
Do you remember when we swore blood brotherhood?
In Årstaviken where Södersjukhuset is located.
We might have been 8 or 9.
I have forgotten.
There are other things I remember more clearly.
You do?
Yes, one doesn't forget such things.
What about me?
Do you think I've forgotten?
For 8 years I've been forced to recall.
8 years!
That's a long time.
Have you...
Been in locked up?
Yes.
That's right.
But not in prison.
In a madhouse.
Or 'mental hospital' as they properly call it.
Locked up like a blasted animal.
While you were successful.
Stig Brender, theatre director!
Stig Brender marries Mai Vendel.
Stig Brender buys country house in Västmanland.
I think you're being childish, Sampe.
Did you say childish?
Infantile, you mean?
Retarded?
That's what they called me.
Just because the stupid girl screamed.
She tried resisting.
A boy held me down.
And got me expelled.
You should leave now.
I'm bloody not leaving.
I'll call the police.
And you think you can?
By the time you've dialed the first numbers,
I've bludgeoned you.
With this one.
It's risk-free.
No-one has seen me enter.
No-one is here.
No-one will see me leave.
Most importantly, nothing connects us anymore.
It'll be your last headline, dear blood brother.
'Stig Brender murdered'
It will be larger than the others.
Put it down.
At once.
Or I'll shoot.
Rubbish.
Blanks.
I read the evening newspapers.
Hello!
Brender?
Are you there?
Good evening, Niklasson.
I heard a shot.
What happened?
Nothing.
There's a gun in the play I'm in.
Blanks, of course
I was rehearsing with it, and it went off.
I got a fright.
I thought there were burglars.
It was nothing.
Good night, Niklasson.
Good night, director.
Stig Brender.
Hello Stig, it's Mac Norling.
Good that I reached you.
I'm at Karlton.
I heard a rumor that you're to cancel the premiere.
Some trouble with Axel Forselius.
Is this true?
It's rubbish.
Nothing else.
You know how it is before a premiere.
Nerves and so on.
Don't write anything about this.
You know how much this premiere means to me.
Every seat matters.
If there's negativity in the papers, the public might avoid the play.
You know how it is.
Yes, you can trust me.
I've always supported you.
A good headline, no?
'"I go in for murder", says Stig Brender"'.
Well, yes, it was good.
Come to the dress rehearsal.
Good.
See you.

'"I go in for murder", says Stig Brender"'
Stig Brender.
Darling, I told you not to sit up.
Soon.
It'll take a little longer.
Mac Norling called.
Go to bed, I'll be home as soon as I can.
What the hell?
Wait a moment.
There are some boys near my car.
They stole the car.
I must hang up.
Go to bed.
Sleep well.
This'll take time.
Police?
A car has been stolen.
This is Stig Brender.
My car has been stolen.
It's a 5 seat Dodge, blue and white.
Number AA34361.
Stolen outside Kungsteatern on Jernvägsgatan.
Boys in their 20s.
They drove down Torsgatan.
I'm in my office at the theatre.
Number 102117.
I repeat. 102117.
I'll wait here for information.
Please hurry.
I'll wait.
There are important papers in the car.
I wish to retrieve them as soon as possible.
Thank you.
From SHD to all cars.
A stolen car.
Registration number AA34361.
Dodge, blue and white.
They're chasing us.
Probably somebody else.
Us, I'm sure.
So what?
Don't be a coward.
It's the police.
I can tell.
Think I'm deaf?
Here it is.
It seems alright.
No point in chasing them further.
Report to the central.
Hello.
Thank God.
Where?
Näsby Park, between Engstigen and Flotilvegen.
No rescue vehicle.
I'll pick it up myself.
It's still driveable?
Good.
Thank you.
Luggage Storage.

Hello miss, this one, please.
One moment.
Thank you.
Was it a bag?
Yes, it was.
I can't find it.
Describe it, sir.
I can't, I'm picking it up for a friend.
I'll check one more time.
It must be there.
One should think so.
Is it still raining?
Excuse me?
I wonder if it's still raining.
No, it has stopped.
Good morning, ladies.
Bad news, unless you've already seen them.
Only 12.50 on our 10.
Not much.
Too bad.
We should play V5 horse racing instead
I found it.
It was between some backpacks.
Shall we call a carrier?
No, not necessary.
It's heavy.
And with that age...
I'll manage.
Good morning, thanks for the help.
Good morning, caretaker.
Better luck next time.
Thank you.
How are you?
All in order.
Damned thugs.
I'll catch them.
Let me take the bag.
I'll take it myself.
Catch the thugs instead.
Good morning, caretaker.
Good morning.
Hello there.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving this bag for director Brender.
Costumes for the new play.
Brender isn't at the theatre at this hour.
Leave it there.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you, but I prefer to hand it over in person.
I'll return later.
Good morning.
Wait a second!
How dare you?
I've been at this theatre for 28 years.
I've seen rings and earrings and 100 bills left behind.
Not a thing has been stolen.
I know as surely as I know my name's Hilda Johansson.
Dear Mrs. Johansson, of course I believe you.
Put down the bag then.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I follow orders.
From the tailors.
Just as you do, Mrs. Johansson.
Good night.
I'll remember you.
Trust me.
Death awaits my Stig, may I never forget you.
Who is it?
Is it director Brender?
Yes, what is it?
May I enter?
It's Mrs. Johansson.
I'm busy.
Will you do me a favour?
Go to the makeup room and get my makeup removers.
Also bring the clothes that are there.
And leave everything outside the door.
Leave them outside the door?
That's right.
Us theatre people are superstitious.
It's very bad to see a cleaner first thing in the morning.
Even worse than someone whistling in the theatre, or wearing a hat on stage.
Unless the script demands it, of course.
You're not in your right mind.
Possibly.
It's how it is.
Accept it and do as I tell you.
But I haven't got a limp.
Limp?
Deval said that a cleaner with a limp is an unlucky symbol, one without one is not.
He was always friendly, director.
I am too, Mrs. Johansson.
I can't help that I am superstitious.
Please do as I told you.
You theatre people...
Stig Brender.
Of course, editor Mac, what can I do for you?
That's correct, but nothing to write about.
Car theft is common.
No damages.
I saw the boys just as they broke into the car.
Just outside the scene entrance.
I see.
It stood on the wrong side of Järnvägsgatan?
Only for a moment.
I parked it there because I was planning to bring some things home.
They were heavy.
I see.
Was the car locked?
No.
These are details for the insurance company.
I'm grateful for all that's written about the theatre and myself as director
But if I have a tax due, or my wife is pregnant,
I expect it won't be written about in the papers.
Being a so-called celebrity has its downsides, director Brender.
We're only doing our job.
Is she pregnant?
No, for God's sake, don't write that.
No, and don't worry about the front page.
We've got a story about a mysterious death in Hagaparken.
The best toy ducks!
2 for 1 crown.
Ducks sold off at shocking prices.
What a gentleman.
The chieftain of the criminal police.
Don't draw false conclusions.
I love the criminal police.
I've become a conscientious man now, Inspector.
How about a duck for your grandchildren?
Please, take it as a present from dexterous Fabian.
Thank you.
Here is a crown for your own grandchildren.
That's what I call a generous soul.
Try to act with your heart, as my mother used to say about Frankenstein's monster.
You had your opportunity, but failed.
We have nothing more to say to each other.
I did the best I could, Mr. Dean.
Possibly.
But it was not good enough.
I've written a letter to Scotland Yard, Mr. Dean.
You should read it before I send it.
It concerns your dealings on behalf of Death, so to speak.
Here I'll shoot.
Bang!
Dead.
Stig, what are you doing?
Nicke, roll the tape back.
We repeat.
Erik, why must I shoot each time?
It's unpleasant for Axel and me.
I don't give a damn.
Nicke must practice clicking the gun.
Do you plan to yell 'Bang!
' at the premiere too?
Repeat from where you leave the letter.
Ready, Nicke?
Yes.
Start then, when Stig has fired the gun.
Stop when Axel has left the stage.
O.K.
Not to bicker, but I won't shoot today.
I'm tired, I haven't slept.
I'm knackered.
Please respect that.
Alright.
Coffee break.
As short as possible.
After we'll repeat act 2.
Stig...
In the courtroom scene, you'll be a cold-blooded murderer, no?
A rattlesnake!
Today you were a slowworm afraid of losing its tail.
I know.
It'll be better, I promise.
Excuse my interruption.
Inspector Envall, criminal police.
I wish to speak with director Brender for a couple of minutes.
Of course.
This way, Inspector.
Stig, isn't this costume impressive?
Excellent.
What are you doing, Mrs. Johansson?
Thorough cleaning, director.
Greatly needed.
The dust from the trains makes the books black.
It must wait.
Clean somewhere else for a while.
Take a seat, Inspector.
Thank you.
Is it about that white-haired old man?
There was something strange about him.
Came here at 7 in the morning looking for the director.
Dear Mrs. Johansson, leave now.
He didn't even want to leave the bag.
Please.
Thank you.
It's about the car theft?
Car theft?
No.
So your car was stolen?
Yes.
Last night.
They retrieved it, thank God.
Cigarette?
No thank you.
I come for another reason.
Does the name Sam Persson tell you anything?
Sam Persson.
No, it doesn't, Inspector.
In my job we meet hundreds of people every year.
Electricians, caretakers, scene workers, and all the extras
I understand.
Sam Persson was a restaurant musician.
He was found dead in Hagaparken this morning.
He sat there with a deep wound in his head.
What an unpleasant story.
But why speak to me about it?
We examined his connections.
The only lead so far - more will probably appear soon - was a phone number written on a cigarette pack found in his pocket.
The number 328142.
That's your home number, no?
It is.
That's right.
He was released from Varlanda mental hospital yesterday afternoon.
He never called you?
I wasn't at home yesterday.
We rehearsed all day and all evening.
During the pause we went to Karlton for food.
Wait.
My wife said a man called at 8 in the evening and asked for me.
He didn't say his name.
What did your wife reply?
That I wasn't at home.
He hung up.
He'd speak to us today instead.
Sam Persson.
The name sounds vaguely familiar.
Sampe.
I've got it, Inspector.
Sampe, of course.
We were schoolmates at Södra Latin many years ago.
A dark-featured boy who always bit his nails.
Were you friends?
Not really.
He quit years before me.
You haven't seen him since?
No.
There's something odd about this death.
The wound in particular.
He may have stumbled in the dark.
Hit his head on the bench, fallen down and died.
The bench?
You said that he was sitting in Hagaparken.
I didn't say anything about a bench.
You didn't?
What else would you be sitting on in a park?
Various things.
A fallen tree trunk, for instance.
Possibly.
But the natural association is to a bench.
On a bench in a park.
There's even a hit called that.
It's terrible, but it's part of my wife's repertoire.
Maybe that's where I got it from.
Probably.
Tell me, why is the police investigating this?
What's mysterious about the death?
He didn't die in the park.
He was brought there.
He was already dead at that point.
Really?
How do you know?
From his shoes, among other things.
They were almost new.
To get to the bench, he'd have to walk 15 metres of rough macadam.
We have proof.
Persson didn't walk that way.
The soles show this.
Couldn't he have walked by the side of the road?
I'd have done that.
I don't think so.
There were watery ditches on each side.
The spots on his skin are crucial.
They indicate that Persson has been dead for several hours.
He sat straight on the bench.
What was the cause of death?
We don't know that yet.
The autopsy report is ready in a couple of days.
We've only conducted external examinations.
Your car - was it damaged?
Not much.
The bumper got a bruise, and the oil pan was hit.
That's it.
What a coincidence.
Just beside the bench, there were oil stains.
That was the only evidence found on the road.
It rained heavily last night.
You don't suspect me of the murder of Sam Persson?
Dear director Brender, why should I?
And who says he was murdered?
It may be murder;
also death as a result of violence.
Or simply an accident.
Time will tell.
I won't keep you any longer.
Thanks for your time.
And good luck with your private little murder, the one on stage, of course.
It looks exciting.
Good afternoon, director Brender.
I'll show myself out.
It goes with the job.
On a bench in a park.
Before the killer vanished, and the rain slowly fell.
He pulled you close.
He held you hard.
And your dream never came true.
On a bench in a park, the murdered one sat, far from time and space
He has stopped playing, for his fingers are stiff.
And his heart forever stopped.
In a moment of dread without beginning or end, on a bench in a park in April
The dead one may speak
Sir
Honoured jury
I hereby accuse Stig Brender of murder.
His motive was evil.
The accusing side calls forth its first witness.
Name?
Lena Wallin.
Birth?
08.04.1918
Death?
09.05.1934
Why?
Look in the suitcase.
The accusing side calls forth its second witness.
Name and occupation?
Gustav Andreas Wallin, vicar.
And your accusation?
Stig Brender took a life.
The greatest of all sins.
Sirs
The murder weapon.
Let me hand it over to the presiding juror.
The defending side may speak.
Sir, I hereby demand that the accused be set free, for I love him.
The defendant's demand is rejected.
Here you go, accuser.
Stop.
For God's sake, stop!
Darling, what is it?
Wake up.
What is it?
Darling.
How horrible.
He crushed your skull.
Piece by piece.
Who did?
It was...
I can't recall.
Darling.
What time is it?
2.30 soon.
Want something calming?
Warm milk?
It's quickly made.
Milk...
You know...
It doesn't sound good, but maybe I should have some.
I'll come to the kitchen.
Take Restenil too, to be on the safe side.
Ofelia, what have I said about laying on the couch?
Down.
Go to your basket.
Dear Mai, not that tune, please.
Don't you like it?
No, I think it's terrible.
It's banal, but it sticks in the mind.
I got the Swedish lyrics to Yves Montands 'Sunday murder' yesterday evening.
Lasse brought them.
They were excellent.
'Sunday murder'.
What a name for a hit.
It's not as macabre as it sounds.
You shouldn't talk, you work with murder yourself.
Let's talk about something else.
What are you doing with the whisky?
Pour it in the milk.
A Scottish sleeping potion.
It sounds odd, but I've always wanted to try.
Do as you wish.
Come now.
I needed to sleep well tonight.
Yesterday's rehearsal went bad.
Soon one can count the hours until the premiere.
We haven't even finished the scenery.
When it looks bad, it goes well.
How was it?
Not too bad.
A taste?
No thank you.
Ofelia, I won't give you anything.
Here's something to chew on.
We'll turn to it later.
Persson seemingly had no close relatives.
You, Helge, must track down his teachers at Södra Latin.
We went to school there between 1925-30.
If you fail, try the national archives.
Or complement eventual information there.
Sten, go to Varlanda.
Get those psychiatrists to express themselves clearly.
Ask the nurse too.
Ture, investigate the arrival at the train station.
We know that Persson had a bag when he left Varlanda.
Here's the description.
If you can't find it, alert all districts.
The pawnbroker too, just in case.
By the way, find the night guard at the theatre.
She might have something to tell us.
I'll go to Vesterås to speak with the woman who Persson almost killed in 1952.
We meet here at 4.
Luggage Storage
Wednesday afternoon at 4.30.
I can't remember.
Lots bags pass through here each day.
I wasn't at work that afternoon.
It was a red-brown bag, slightly tattered, ca. 80x50 cm?
Exactly.
I handed out one such Thursday morning at about 7.30.
Of course, it might not be that particular one.
Lots of bags look that way.
Do you remember the person who picked it up?
I remember very well.
A little old man with white beard and glasses.
As we just noted, if all customers were that lovely this job would be a joy.
You're demanding too much, constable.
Just think for yourself:
42 years of service, at least 4 classes each year and about 30 boys in each class.
You do the math.
I'm nearly 80 and can barely remember my own name.
And you ask about a boy who's name is Persson.
Sam Persson.
Sam...
One wouldn't recall first names of schoolboys.
Nicknames, possibly.
Do you know what they called me?
No.
Tomten.
Strange, no?
Better than 'Plonker' and 'Whiner'.
Not to mention 'Minger'.
He used snus and spat all the time.
An unpleasant habit.
Sam Persson.
Nothing?
Late 1920s, you said?
Yes.
Sam Persson.
Sam...
Pers...
Sampe!
That's the one.
Small, dark, disloyal, a cheater, slow learner, slightly strange, bad influence, a little dim.
It ended badly.
Very badly.
Tricked a girl into a dressing room during a dance event, molested her, discovered by another boy.
A fight.
Taken to the headmaster
Expelled.
Well remembered, no?
Yes, indeed.
What's the other boy's name?
Dear constable, easy now.
Ultra posse nemo obligatur.
No one is obligated beyond what he is able to do, as the old Roman law said.
Persson.
A paranoid psychopath.
Unreasonably suspicious, in other words.
Why did you let him go?
He was only on parole.
To look for jobs.
The last years his behaviour was normal.
Well, quite introverted, but no violent behaviour against personnel or other patients.
That doesn't exclude the possibility of certain obsessions.
He has showed signs of aggression.
It's not humane keeping a person locked up for years.
Must be let out once there are no signs of illness.
And they are judged as not a danger to society.
The paranoia you spoke of...
Was it directed at a particular person?
Not that I know of.
Just a general dislike of successful people.
And his aggressivity?
This hairdresser in Vesterås to whom he had a random connection.
If the neighbour hadn't broken in it might've ended badly.
And there was a fight outside here right after he came.
Otherwise he'd be let on parole earlier.
Did he fight personnel?
No, a patient.
Dahlman, attendant at ward 6, was present.
He'll tell you the details
Persson had painted a board and framed it.
Written in biblical language.
Something about death.
I can't quite remember.
He was very proud of it.
He hung it over his bed.
One day another patient visited him.
A tall, rough man.
He started making fun of the board.
He thought it was silly.
'How childish', he said.
I remember.
Parsson got furious.
'Did you say 'childish'?
', he said.
'Infantile?
'
Then he attacked him
Anything else you might add?
The scrapbook.
He collected paper clippings.
Bought all sorts of magazines.
He was secretive about it.
He kept the book locked up.
Hid the magazines so no-one'd know what clippings he collected.
But I've got an idea.
I bet it was Bardot Marilyn Monroe.
What a wild taste, said the crone, eating the cat up.
Hairdresser
Certain my husband won't know about this, Inspector?
He is Italian, you see.
Works at ASEA.
You know how Italians are.
Can't smile at other men.
Not to worry, Mrs. Kornelli.
No one'll know about this.
I know roughly what...
I know roughly what happened that February night in 1952.
I'd like a few details.
Persson played as usual at the City Hotel that night.
What were you doing?
I was at the theatre with a friend.
The owner of this hairdressers.
Do you remember the play?
Yes, it was 'The Unmoralist' with Stig Brender.
That's why I was there.
So you liked him?
Yes, very much so.
He was my idol, as they say.
I couldn't miss the event when the tour came to town.
And after the play?
Dined at the City Hotel while waiting for Sam...
Persson that is.
I had decided to end our relationship.
I'd delayed it for a while.
Hadn't said anything until then.
In fact I didn't dare.
So you were afraid of Persson?
Not exactly afraid.
But he was strange.
A little different
Was Brender present in the dining area?
Yes, Inspector, it was nice to see my idol close up.
I made sure to go when he did.
In the cloakroom I asked for his autograph.
Then Persson came?
Are you a mindreader?
Yes, he came.
Looked very angry.
He'd had a few drinks.
You know, restaurant musicians...
I retreated to the lobby.
I couldn't hear what they said.
But they were very angry.
I heard Brender say:
'Watch it, or I'll make sure your life becomes hell'
And Brender vanished down the stairs.
Late that night you broke up with Persson?
Yes.
I won't forget that moment.
'I understand', Sam said, 'you love Brender'.
Then he attacked me.
It took a while for the door to open and Brender to come down.
He looked very pale.
It's not odd, given how much he works.
Others work in the evening, he works in the day too.
Works night and day before the premiere.
He said he fiddled with the gun.
Blanks, of course.
And it went off.
He went back upstairs.
A little old man with white beard.
I recall somebody saying that recently.
Ah, the cleaner at Kungsteatern.
She said he wouldn't let go of the bag.
I'm convinced Brender's involved in Persson's death.
But how?
His name is a red line through the whole incident.
Södra Latin, Vesterås.
The phone number on the cigarette pack.
He spoke of the bench before I mentioned it.
He pretended not to know Persson.
He denied that they had met after he was expelled.
The gunshot in the theatre.
The damaged oil pan, and the oil stain on the road.
And the white-bearded man who at the theatre the morning after with a bag he refuses to let go of.
Brender's words in Vesterås:
'Watch it, or I'll make sure your life becomes hell'.
Perhaps he did.
Yes?
Director Brender wants to speak to the Inspector.
Speak of the devil.
Tell him to enter.
Wait a while.
Hello again, director Brender.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
How may I help you?
I couldn't sleep tonight, Inspector.
I lay thinking about Sam Persson.
I'll add to the information given yesterday.
May I smoke?
Of course.
You don't mind me recording this?
Easiest way to document a testimony.
One gets the exact words, also pauses and tones.
Sure, record away.
Go ahead.
My first love was a girl named Lena Wallin.
Her father was a vicar.
During a dance event at Södra Latin
Sam Persson tricked her into a dressing room.
I found them, but too late.
We almost killed each other, Sam and I.
A teacher appeared.
We were taken to the headmaster.
And of course Sam was expelled.
The girl Wallin became pregnant.
When I discovered
I attempted to convince his father to accept a legal abortion.
The law had just taken effect.
But he refused.
He said it was against God's will.
She had a miscarriage the seventh month.
And she and the child died
Those vicars...
But one can't say such things.
They have their point of view.
You can'tve thought well of Persson after that.
No, really not.
I happily never saw him again.
And time heals all wounds, as they say.
Wounds, you say?
You have cuts on your hands.
Ah, those.
It's the dog.
Ofelia.
We must cut her claws soon.
Hunting dog?
Yes, she's a dachshund.
But we don't use her for hunting.
I'm not a hunter.
Hunting is my special hobby.
Criminals at work, foxes and hares in my spare time.
Lots of game at your property Västmanland?
Yes, lots.
You'd be welcome to visit us.
Thank you.
Can't say no to a proper moose hunt.
There are moose, no?
Lots of it.
But we leave those to our leaseholders.
In return we get meat each year.
Won't the meat go bad during train transport?
I pick it up with the car.
It's only a couple of hours.
To return to Persson:
you still don't know the cause of death?
Still?
Our pathologists should've heard your remark.
No.
Autopsies take time.
Other things are often prioritised.
I see.
That's all, Inspector.
Would you like to come to the premiere tomorrow?
'Mr.
Murder', it should interest you.
I'm grateful, director Brender, my wife will be excited.
Two tickets behind the counter then.
I wish you a great evening.
Surely.
And thanks for your visit.
Stenbeck, please.
Helge, locate Brender's car.
Probably at a garage.
Tell them we investigate the theft.
Examine the trunk.
Brender's destiny might hang by a hair.
By a moose's hair.
Beware!
The police suspects you of murder!
- Someone from the past
Missing bag may dispel Haga mystery.
Hello, director Brender, how's the car?
No serious damages I hope.
No, it was fine.
The boys aren't well behaved these days.
They only get worse.
Though it's a bit better here at Söder.
Yes, this place is part of my childhood.
I'm on my way to my old dresser.
I give him used clothes.
And a bottle of cognac for the weekend.
- Sir, may we take a picture?
- Of course
You are an actor, right?
- I try my best
It's Stig Brender obviously.
See?
I told you so.
Is that 3 metres?
Further back.
Hurry, the sun recedes.
In that case we can turn on the searchlight.
It may help.
Excellent, constable.
If it's good, we'll send the photograph to the magazine competition.
Maybe the police intelligence may have one too.
Let me put this down.
It's not very pretty.
Hurry up.
Sir, look a bit happier.
I'll try.
Wait.
Take off your hat.
What the hell?
What a place to put a bag.
People might die.
Calm down.
Else we'll take you to the station.
I'm sorry that I walked out my own door.
By all means, go on favouring the upper class!
Typical.
Girls, hurry up.
Yes.
Watch out.
Smile a little.
You can do better.
Don't squint your eyes.
It's the spotlight.
Actors should be used to that.
1... 2... 3...
The bag!
We'll help you.
I'll manage.
It was our fault.
It doesn't matter.
Go now.
Fine.
If we win, we'll send a copy.
Bye.
Faulty lock?
It's my dresser's old bag.
I only use it for this purpose.
It's fine for now.
Bye, constables.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Same to you.
Are you deaf, Piss-Oskar?
Can't you hear the knocking?
I don't give a damn.
And don't called me Piss-Oskar.
My years as toilet caretaker are long past.
Puss did fine, said the girl, and threw her trousers in the bonfire.
What the devil?
What do you want?
Mum sent us with this bag.
It contains clothes and so on.
30 crows for the lot.
Well now.
Lindstöm's never afraid of a bargain.
Enter.
Let me have a look.
Liars.
You little liars.
Where did you find this?
Spit it out.
Or I'll take you to the cops.
A man left it in the bonfire at Fåfängan.
You're lying like a lark speaks the French.
Have you stolen it?
No, it's true, mr.
Johansson.
He hid it and left.
Give the brats a fiver.
May be its value.
Don't interrupt.
There's something very strange about this.
Stolen goods, surely.
If not worse.
I can smell it.
You know what it smells of?
Corpses.
A smell of death.
I've got a nose for such things.
Enter.
A Mr. Victorin is looking for the director.
At this time of day?
I can't receive visitors.
I must go home and sleep.
But he is blind, director Brender.
Blind?
Yes, he has brought a guide dog.
Alright, ask him in.
Enter, Mr. Victorin.
Here's the door.
Sorry to bother you.
By all means.
I'll help you.
Here's a chair.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Maybe just stupidities.
I'm old and blind.
I sit and think about things.
Like what?
I've got habits, director Brender.
Easily developed in this situation.
Every night, Rufus, my dog that is, and I go for a walk.
The streets are nice and quiet then.
Wednesday we went as usual, in spite of the rain.
When we passed the theatre's scene entrance
Rufus began acting strange.
Became anxious, and started barking.
When we returned 10 minutes later, he sat down and started yelping.
Right outside the scene entrance.
How do you know it was precisely there?
I've lived in that street for 22 years.
A blind man counts his steps.
I heard your car was stolen at that time.
and that they found a dead man in Hagaparken.
who'd been transported there.
Rufus has only acted that way once in the past.
and that was when we came across a worker who had fallen and broken his neck.
I sat thinking and put 2 and 2 together.
What if the car thieves had killed a person and hid the body in the trunk just when we passed by.
That would explain his behaviour.
And now I wonder whether I should report to the police.
No need - no body in the car when I retrieved it.
No.
They would've already placed it in Hagaparken.
I saw them breaking into the car.
They had no corpse.
Are you absolutely sure?
Absolutely.
So I shouldn't go to the police?
No need at all.
Alright.
If publicly known, this could harm you personally.
Especially considering the premiere.
Oh yes?
A newspaper would pay well for such a story, no?
500 surely.
That's a lot for a poor man like me.
You misjudge the newspapers' respectability, Mr. Victorin
Shall we say 500?
If you weren't blind, I'd...
I despise blackmailers
It'll be 1000 then!
Maybe I'm not quite so blind
Alright.
Then you know where the door is 1000 crowns is only...
Out!
At once!
I hope your life will go to hell.
To hell!
You hear?
To hell!
To hell!
Stig Brender arrested for murder.
You said you were on your way to an old dress.
What's his name?
Lindblad.
Sture Lindblad.
Sture Lindblad died two years ago.
I didn't know that.
You're lying, Brender.
You were in his funeral.
You were carrying Sam Persson's bag.
And the white-bearded man who picked it up was you.
You can't prove it.
You were afraid the police'd get hold of it.
You were afraid it'd contain objects linking you to Persson.
Pure fantasy!
Your disguise gave you away.
An old man couldn't carry that bag.
And he protected it from ruffians.
For 25 years you had hated Persson.
Wednesday night he came asking for help with a job you made sure to get your revenge.
Revenge for the indirect killing of the only person you've loved,
Lena Wallin.
You hit him with the gun used in the play.
You had it in the inside jacket pocket.
We have received the autopsy report.
Persson died of a severe skull fracture.
And you were the one who did that to him.
Director Brender.
It's not true, Inspector.
It's not true.
Director Brender?
Is it Leander?
Yes, of course.
It's over 1 o'clock.
Go home, director.
Premiere tomorrow, remember
Why can't I learn this...
Yes.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I'll hang up.
He'll use the other telephone.
Pick it up again, Stig
It was my wife.
What do you want, Inspector?
Sorry to bother you a Sunday morning.
I've had two phone calls concerning you.
First with the pathologist who examined Persson.
And then with the Prosecution Authority.
I've got something to tell you.
Your formulation sounds very official.
May we speak over the phone?
I prefer to speak in person.
Oh.
Us actors are supersitious, as you know.
Part of my ritual before a premiere includes a walk in Skansen zoo.
Care to join me?
Excellent.
In an hour?
Outside the entrance.
Alright.
See you.
Let's hear it then.
What did you want to tell me?
You've lied to me.
You've duped the police and hidden vital evidence.
Really?
Director Brender, I know where Persson died.
I also know how and why.
Even how he was brought to Hagaparken, and by whom.
Can you prove it, Inspector?
I should think so.
But you aren't sure?
I quote the defence lawyer in 'Mr. Murder':
Circumstantial evidence and testimonies are not enough.
I demand proof.
A link that connects the accused with the murder?
I don't believe the inspector can provide that.
I maintain I didn't meet Persson that night.
I'll tell you one of many details.
Persson's trousers were covered in moose hair.
We also found that in your car.
Varlanda mental hospital lies in Uppland, no?
Lots of moose there.
I assume Persson went for walks in the area.
Let's go and watch the bears.
If two get up on their hind legs, the premiere will be a success.
It doesn't look good.
None of them wants to stand up.
Did you watch the bonfires last night?
No, I was at dress rehearsals.
Of course.
You grew up at Södra -
I assume you went to Fåfängan as a child to watch the bonfires on Walpurgis Night.
Of course.
The best view in town.
It didn't burn up, director Brender.
What didn't?
The bag that you hid in the bonfire.
Some boys saw you.
They identified you on a photograph.
They took the bag.
It ended up at the police, and I got it.
Alright, Inspector, I give up.
You've caught me.
Thanks to the contents of the bag.
Persson's scrapbook with stories about you.
The board with the text 'Death awaits my Stig'.
That Stig was you.
The hammer, covered in Persson's fingerprints.
The incident was clear.
Persson was obsessed with you.
All in his life failed because of you, he thought, and came to the theatre to get revenge.
He came to kill you.
You threatened him with the gun that went off.
Persson fell and hit is head against the desk,
I assume.
And died.
Do you know from what?
No.
Traumatic aortic rupture.
An aortic valve was thin as a result of an illness.
This condition and the strain were the causes of death, in other words.
It was self-defense, Inspector.
I believe so too.
I can't understand why you didn't call the police.
The scandal, Inspector.
Imagine the posters.
It was impossible given the premiere.
The last days can't have been pleasant?
Pleasant?
It has been a nightmare, Inspector.
A four days' nightmare.
It's over now.
Since the victim died of natural causes, the prosecution will take no actions
That's the decision I wanted to tell you about.
Good luck tonight.
But one shouldn't say that.
Right, but thank you anyway, Inspector.

NISHI AND IWABUCHI WEDDING PARTY
The ceremony is almost over.
This way, please.
- Have the Dairyu executives arrived?
- Yes.
- Where?
- In the hall?
Over there, in the reception area.
In front of the screen, by the pine tree.
- We want to see them immediately.
- Just for a minute.
So we don't disturb the banquet.
Excuse me.
Please make way for the bride and groom.
- The banquet's about to begin.
- Quick!
A police detective!
What's all this about?
Why cover the wedding of the daughter of Public Corporation's vice president?
- Don't play dumb.
They're both here.
- Who is?
You searched Dairyu and nabbed their accountant.
- Is the president or director next?
- Or both?
Excuse me.
Get a shot of them busting him.
Wada, get back to your seat.
I can't run the party without you.
Sir... the party program is outlined here.
- Who is that?
- Someone from Dairyu?
No, he's with Public Corp.
That's Wada, assistant chief of contracts.
That's Wada, right?
Hello.
News desk?
Here's a twist:
An arrest in Public Corp. 's contracts division.
The Public Corporation for Land Development.
That's right:
Assistant chief of contracts at Public Corp.
This is bigger than just embezzlement at Dairyu Construction.
It's obviously a kickback scheme between Dairyu and Public Corp.
Yes, I'll stay on the story.
Now that the ceremony is duly completed, we will commence the wedding feast.
I, Shirai, chief of contracts for Public Corporation, hereby undertake to serve, however poorly, as master of ceremonies.
First, our president, Arimura, who acted as matchmaker, will present the bride and groom.
Please allow me to present the couple.
The bridegroom, Koichi Nishi, who stands here beside me, hardly needs me to enumerate the skills he has displayed as Vice President Iwabuchi's secretary.
He only became secretary after his engagement.
I just heard that at the reception desk.
Nishi, who lost his family to the war...
What did this Nishi do before?
Unclear.
He's a pal of Iwabuchi's son.
What's the son do?
Nothing.
The infamous prodigal son.
He's the one who shocked everyone by catching the bride before she fell.
Nishi's future prospects glow brightly indeed.
As for his lovely bride, Yoshiko, she is a talented alumna of Keitoku Girls School and is not only exquisite, but also a rare paragon of unsullied innocence.
There's a senryu verse that goes:
"The bride is beautiful - that is, with dowry in hand. "
Don't be so cruel.
The groom is the cruel one.
He only married her to guarantee his own success.
On this most auspicious of days...
Auspicious indeed!
- And him?
- Moriyama, top administrator.
As great as the joy of both families must already be, we, the employees of Public Corporation, extend to them our most sincere congratulations.
For it is now three years since our corporation first...
Who's that?
Iwabuchi, vice president.
An assistant chief in contracts, his boss, the administrator, and the vice president.
It all adds up.
Iwabuchi-san, the new father-in-law...
Wait.
It's all coming back now.
Five years ago, that illegal bid on government construction.
An assistant, Furuya, jumped from a seventh-story window, but they covered it up.
Back then, Iwabuchi was division head, with Moriyama and Shirai under him.
The "Clean-Up Trio" of graft.
Then they all landed equivalent positions at Public Corp...
Nice little racket they've got going.
Now Moriyama-san will propose a toast to the newlyweds.
I'm actually among you today to stand in for the groom's father.
Someone more appropriate should propose the toast.
Enough formalities.
Get on with your toast.
Yes.
Hardly the time for him to be making a toast.
If it's not too presumptuous,
I'll toast to the bride and groom's future.
Cheers!
- Congratulations.
Another arrest?
Hey, he's with Dairyu Construction.
Did the police let him go?
Now let's take congratulations from our assembled guests.
First, Hatano-san, president of Dairyu Construction.
As you've been told,
I am Hatano of Dairyu Construction.
Today we sit among distinguished guests from political, government and business circles.
I am insignificant in comparison.
To be accorded the unexpected honor of speaking first leaves me dumbfounded.
He's really sweating his way through this one.
As for our relationship with Public Corporation,
Public found our fair and upright approach to business compatible with their own founding principles.
We've set aside profits in the interest of long-term goals and cooperated to achieve our present success.
The thing is, what I'd most like to say is
I have no personal ties to Public Corp.
Some toast.
Like he's pleading his case to the prosecutor.
It's difficult to find the right words, but I offer my most sincere congratulations.
May the bride and groom forge a strong marital bond and find great happiness together.
These are my congratulations, brief though they may be.
Next, the bridegroom's friend will speak on behalf of his circle.
He is also the bride's brother.
Tatsuo Iwabuchi will now offer congratulatory remarks.
Traditionally, in making a wedding toast, we stick to the same old sugarcoated clichés.
Frankly, my father isn't crazy about aspects of Nishi's past outlined in a detective agency's report.
But then it's not my father who's getting married.
My father has to accept that Yoshiko's in love with him.
Fact is, I love Nishi too.
We became friends a year and a half ago when I bought a used sports car from his tiny car dealership.
Since then, I've learned that Nishi has a rare sense of justice.
Rumors are flying about this wedding, about Nishi using my sister's disability to boost himself up the corporate ladder.
But I swear it can't be true.
I'm firmly convinced of that.
Hey, Nishi.
I'm counting on you to look after my sister.
She's had a tough life.
I may be a mess, but I'd do anything to protect her.
Listen, Nishi.
If you make my sister unhappy,
I swear I'll kill you!
A bit unconventional perhaps, but a great speech, brimming with passion.
Now it's time for the bride and groom to cut the wedding cake.
Yet another cake.
That's a strange one.
Must be a business gift.
Hey, looks like that ministry building.
Look, there's a rose on the seventh floor.
That's the window that guy jumped from.
What is it, Shirai?
Get on with it!
Yes... yes.
Allow me to replace that.
Helluva wedding.
Truly bizarre.
Best one-act I've ever seen.
One-act?
This is just the prelude.

PROSECUTION CALLS FOR CONTINUED DETENTION OF EXECS
EXECS' RELEASE PENDING - PROSECUTOR RUNNING OUT OF TIME
Wada-san, who on earth have you been protecting with your three weeks of silence?
You work for Public Corporation.
Like any government official, you have a duty to serve the public interest.
The 12 billion you guys gave Dairyu for construction costs were taxes the public paid with their sweat and blood.
Legitimate expenses are one thing.
But there's no question that the bidding was rigged.
All the other bids came in between 8.5 and nine billion.
Only Dairyu's 12-billion bid matched what Public Corp. Had estimated.
It fit like a glove.
Three billion higher than the others.
On top of that, you required all the bidders to submit complete itemized budgets immediately.
If they couldn't, you rejected them as unprofessional.
You handed that job to Dairyu on a silver platter.
This is an outrage!
A reckless waste of the public's hard-earned money!
You owe it to the public to reveal everything you know.
You're in charge of Public Corp. 's contracts.
No bidding scheme could have proceeded without your participation.
You're an expert in budgeting.
Bidders want that information badly.
I'll make an educated guess and say the idea to demand itemized budgets from Dairyu's competitors could only have come from an old business hand like you.
We're both a bit tired.
By the way, don't you live over in Zoshigaya?
I ran across this.
A receipt from the Hatsufune Restaurant's regular taxi company.
Of course the date, destination and time are all here.
"October 7, from Hatsufune to Zoshigaya. "
And another fare on the same date to Kamimachi.
Isn't that where your boss lives?
Then, on the same day, a fare to Nishiogikubo.
That's Moriyama's neighborhood, isn't it?
And this one to Shibuya, where Vice President Iwabuchi lives.
Wada-san, what am I to make of all this?
Hatsufune's books indicate Dairyu covered it all.
Sticking with your silence?
Look at this stack of receipts from other days.
PROSECUTOR NONAKA
Yes?
Special delivery.
Anonymous.
Something else from our informer.
"Look at taxi receipts from Hatsufune's regular company. "
Incredible.
One step behind us, but right on track.
Who could it be?
The tips are always right on target.
Most informers are rivals using slander for revenge.
This seems different.
Maybe it's from the same person the reporters mentioned who pulled off that wedding cake stunt.
No clue who sent that cake, right?
No, all we've got is the name of the bakery, an order describing the design, its destination, the date, and the alarming amount of cash delivered to pay for it.
Come in.
Still nothing?
He seemed like the perfect way to get to the Iwabuchi-Moriyama-Shirai clique.
How about Miura?
What'll we do?
We can't keep holding them.
We'll let Wada go.
And Miura?
Switch his charge to embezzlement and squeeze him harder.
We've discovered 23 million in undocumented payments on Dairyu's books.
Miura in accounting can't explain them.
Clear grounds for embezzlement charges.
If they were bribes, he could claim they were development costs and eventually return to the business.
But if he lined his own pockets with company funds, he'll never work again.
If we charge him with embezzlement, he'll talk.
So release him and then -
Releasing him and arresting him again is a dirty trick, but his tactics are even dirtier.
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER
That must have been an ordeal.
Miura-san, another warrant for you.
I'm his lawyer.
Embezzlement?
Before I came to meet you, the president, the other top executives, and I anticipated this very eventuality.
The president said that if it were to happen,
I should give you the following message.
He was quite adamant about it.
He said, "I know you'll see this through to the bitter end. "
Stop!
Prosecutor, any comment on Miura's suicide?
Your statement was short on detail.
- Did Miura really kill himself?
- He did.
Prosecutor, isn't this an advance in the art of murder?
That message the president sent with his lawyer right before Miura's suicide -
"I know you'll see this through to the bitter end" - might as well have been a bullet from a high-powered rifle.
This was, in fact, an assassination.
This was - in fact - nothing but a suicide.
Just a minute.
Aren't you concerned Wada will be next?
After his release, Wada met with Moriyama and Shirai.
He has yet to return home.
Can you confirm that he's safe?
Any word of his whereabouts?
We're conducting a thorough investigation.
IN CONFERENCE
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
SITE THREE
Forgive me.
I'll do it right now.
You've become a real lapdog, haven't you?
You'd kill yourself just because Moriyama and Shirai told you to.
Those masters you so loyally serve are celebrating even now.
To Iwabuchi, Moriyama and Shirai, you're just a nuisance, a walking liability they want to be rid of.
But listen to me:
Cattle and swine die kinder deaths!
I don't understand.
How can you say such things when you're -
When I'm Iwabuchi's son-in-law?
What'll it be?
You wanna die?
WADA OF PUBLIC CORPORATION COMMITS SUICIDE
DO SUICIDES PROVE CORRUPTION?
A SECOND VICTIM, FAST ON MIURA'S HEELS
UNDERLINGS SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO CONTAIN SCANDAL
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
What are your thoughts on Wada's suicide?
I grieve for him deeply.
Is that all?
First we had Miura's suicide, followed by Wada's.
Fairly convenient developments for Dairyu and Public Corporation.
What does that mean?
This way the bribery investigation goes up in smoke, just like five years ago with the ministry building contract.
Don't let your imagination run away with you, my friend.
Your statements are groundless.
You think so?
The public isn't so sure.
They wonder if those two really had to die.
You're barking up the wrong tree... with these questions.
Miura killed himself after three weeks of interrogation when they released him, only to serve him with another warrant.
As for Wada,
I gather he was an earnest man with a meek personality.
An innocent man accused of dishonesty, on the verge of a breakdown when he was released.
What drove these two men to their deaths?
Why don't you ask the prosecutor's office for the truth?
N. I. AUTO SALES AND SERVICE
Yes, a Chrysler.
No, a New Yorker won't do.
Has to be an Imperial.
Black exterior, gray interior.
Got that?
You should eat something.
What kind of person is Nishi?
Given his relationship to the vice president, I just don't -
Why did he save me?
I mean, what did he accomplish?
Please tell me.
Just what kind of person is he?
And what kind of person are you?
What's your relationship to him?
My relationship with Nishi?
It's very complex and mysterious.
Time to go.
- Where?
- Your funeral.
I just dropped off an offering on behalf of Iwabuchi and the firm.
They've put on quite a show.
A five-tier altar, three priests, and two huge wreaths courtesy of Public Corp.
A beautiful funeral.
I knew it.
And here you are -
Dairyu would've liked to send flowers in celebration, but that would've been a bit obvious.
Why are you doing this to me?
This is sheer torment.
I'd rather be dead.
Please, let me die.
I have to die.
Wasting this fine funeral -
Calm down, now.
There's something I want you to hear.
You've been to Noir, right?
The bar run by Moriyama's mistress?
This is Moriyama and Shirai talking there last night.
What, you come to this kind of place?
And so soon after getting married?
You've caught me red-handed.
I'm ready for a dance.
Now, now.
No need to rush off.
That's when I placed a briefcase with this tape recorder inside it under their table.
I'll play their conversation for you after they arrive for the funeral.
Public Corp. 's official car.
Chief Shirai!
Moriyama!
Man, oh, man, what a relief.
You were born with a gift for persuasion.
That sounds awful.
Look who's talking.
You left him no choice but suicide.
Cut it out.
No need to spell it out like that.
Let's drink and enjoy ourselves tonight.
Still, it all leaves a bad taste in my mouth somehow.
Get yourself a young girl, the best remedy for a day like today.
Wada, still ready to die for them and let them go scot-free?
Don't you want revenge?
- Revenge?
- That's right.
You and me together.
Drinking so early?
Did you see the papers?
Makes me feel like crap.
A drunk needs no excuse to drink.
I wish I had your blind faith in Dad.
What the papers hint at can't be true.
Our father couldn't possibly -
He's been a good father to you.
Loved you enough for two after Mom died.
Is he a bad father to you?
No, he's a good father to me too, which is why this drives me so crazy.
Let's drop the subject.
A baby like you can only trust blindly.
I'm not a baby.
Oh, excuse me.
Lady of the house, is it?
What's wrong?
Are you happy?
Does Nishi...
love you?
You sure?
Yes.
Why do you ask?
If he loves you, that's all that matters.
The prosecution seems to have let up, and the matter's closed.
I'm sorry for allowing this to cause you such concern.
Who?
The president?
I'll give the old man a vague report at some point.
No doubt he'll hold forth about earnest principles and such.
I trust you'll be able to handle him.
Yes, thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Isn't it time you took off that mourning band?
And you should knock before entering, even if you are a member of the family.
That's all for today.
Make a left here.
MITSUl STORAGE
It's ready, sir.
Follow me.
- This is all very mysterious.
- Yes, I -
Just who do you think stole that five million yen in cash from the safe-deposit box in the vault?
When I found that postcard in the box,
I assumed it was probably the same person who sent that cake to the wedding banquet.
That cake had to be from one of the losing bidders.
But how could they get to the vault?
Only you and Wada knew of it.
That's just it.
We set up two - no, three levels of security to protect that deposit box.
And those were?
The key and seal to enter the vault are in a suitcase in storage.
But you need my regular office seal to access the storage room.
And here's the key to the suitcase.
I keep them both in my unlocked desk drawer.
It seemed safer than acting as if I had something to hide.
The seal and key are useless anyway unless you know about the suitcase in storage.
An ingenious plan.
Thank you.
The thing is, the complexity of the plan only implicates you more deeply.
Only you and Wada knew the whole setup.
Take away Wada and that leaves you.
No wonder Moriyama is suspicious of you.
But I
- I would never -
Calm down.
But -
By the way, do you still have the key and seal for the deposit box?
Yes.
Hand them over.
It's hardly a huge sum, but Moriyama should still investigate.
What's wrong?
Don't you have them?
No, it's just -
I thought - In my briefcase -
In your secretary's office.
Nishi speaking.
- Bring in Shirai's briefcase.
- No, I'll get it myself.
Thank you.
Just what are you doing?
Aren't the key and seal in your briefcase either?
No, it's not that.
Then show them to me.
Why won't you open it?
Seems there's something in there you don't want me to see.
Let's have a look.
I said open it!
I have no idea... how that got in my briefcase.
That's enough.
Come with me.
I don't have any -
Just follow me!
Sir, we're in Kamimachi now.
Which house is yours?
Sir?
Sir, this is Kamimachi Block 2.
Sir. that's 540 yen.
Your change.
Wada!
You expect me to believe that Wada's alive and that he took the money?
Ridiculous!
Don't say that.
It's true.
I saw him with my own eyes.
Enough of your excuses.
Wada!
Our work is done for tonight.
Isn't it fun playing a ghost?
What's wrong?
You saw him, didn't you?
Shirai's face.
Why should you care?
Aren't you happy to see him suffer?
What's the matter?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, it's Shirai-san.
See that he gets home.
I swear, I saw Wada with my own eyes.
I swear it.
Enough!
I wonder if Father's all right.
Forget Dad.
Worry about your husband.
I don't know what Nishi's up to.
He's out late every night.
He came home early last night.
Oh, you're home.
It's late.
Had to go out with the boys.
Did you go to Noir?
Yeah, something like that.
I was there all evening.
Listen, Nishi.
Yoshiko, please get some more ice.
- You're going to drink more?
I'll start a new round with Nishi.
Bring me that ice.
Hey.
Why do you two sleep in separate rooms?
The project I'm working on keeps me out till all hours.
I'd hate to wake her in the middle of the night.
What the hell are you up to?
The stakes must be awfully high.
It's written all over your face.
I know well enough that being Dad's secretary involves you in risky situations.
But listen, Nishi.
Don't risk your neck for him.
If only for Yoshiko's sake.
She's -
I feel such pity for her.
And I have only my own stupidity to blame.
When she was just this small,
I took a fall on my bike with her on the back.
It's my fault she's lame, Nishi.
She has to be happy.
I have to help her.
I'm begging you.
You've got to make her happy.
Please.
Yoshiko!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
- No, I'm sorry.
I'm fine.
Thank goodness.
Good night!
Good night.
So Shirai even hounded you at home?
Do you think my husband is still alive?
I'm terribly sorry.
I think you should give up any such hope.
But Shirai-san says he's definitely seen him.
He's hallucinating.
Your husband's death came as a great shock to him.
He's suffered a nervous breakdown.
Where's Chief Moriyama?
Shirai-san, where's Chief Moriyama?
He's in the conference room.
Vice President Iwabuchi wishes to see him.
Shirai?
You mean, he even went to you?
But I just can't -
Iwabuchi explained what happened.
But there's no reason for Shirai to swipe such a measly sum.
We've paid you more than amply.
Shirai needs a cut too.
This is nonsense!
Of course he's been rewarded handsomely.
Isn't that right?
- Yes.
A man with a full stomach doesn't bother with snacks.
We've got to stick together.
Don't go too rough on Shirai.
Let me handle him.
You can't meddle with our affairs at Public Corp.
But what if he gets desperate?
He might start blabbing to the prosecutor.
Then you're done for.
That's your choice, but don't drag us down with you.
This whole bidding scheme was your idea.
You asked us to estimate a nine-billion job at 12 billion and kick back the three billion to you.
We didn't like the idea one bit, but we like doing business with you, so we came on board.
But now you'd risk all our necks for a measly five million.
We've had enough.
You say three billion, but you've only kicked back half.
Ten percent is a standard kickback.
1.5 on 12 billion's plenty.
- But our deal was -
- Listen, Iwabuchi.
You want a political career.
You're eyeing a ministry seat.
If you get it, we'll reconsider our position.
I think we've made ourselves absolutely clear.
Let's leave the Shirai problem in Iwabuchi-san's hands.
Excuse us.
- Thank you.
Let's go.
They're rather full of themselves, I have to say.
You're one to talk.
Are you sure you've given Shirai his share?
Why, I would never -
Forget it.
Just do something about him.
- Meaning?
- Calm him down somehow.
Take him out to dinner and apologize.
Apologize?
That's what it means to be on top!
He hardly looks the part of a bad guy.
These are just about done.
It's too hot.
How's that?
Moriyama-san's on the phone.
I'll take it.
How are Nishi's performance evaluations?
Just about perfect.
But he never seems to relax and open up.
Yoshiko will loosen him up a bit, right?
By the way, Father,
I have a request.
- I hope it isn't money.
- No, it's not that.
Give up your political ambitions and retire as soon as you're a grandfather.
You're the one who'd suffer, forced to give up all your luxuries.
In that case, I'll get a job.
I'll believe that when I see it.
Moriyama-san wishes to speak to you directly.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
What?
You leave me no choice.
I'll be there.
Where are you?
What?
Suminoya?
Are you crazy?
Why in the world did you take him there?
Are you going out?
Shall I join you?
- No.
Where's Father?
He's gone out.
I'll be going out after dinner too.
Thank you for coming.
We'll call you if we need you.
I think it's what they call paranoia.
What's wrong, Shirai?
Why don't you join us?
Come, now.
Do as our vice president says.
Let's have a toast.
Everything's exactly the same.
Just like it was... five years ago.
That night Furuya sat there, you were there, and I was there.
The conversation started the same way.
"Let's have a toast. "
Don't make me laugh!
You can't talk me into jumping out a window, the way you did with Furuya.
Try that with me... and I'll spill the whole story.
Shirai, calm down now.
We've invited you here because our relationship with you has been under some strain and we'd like to improve it.
In a word, we're here out of concern for your state of mind.
The exact same words.
That's exactly how you backed Furuya into a corner.
Wada too.
You know where Shirai lives?
Draw me a map.
You know the Kamimachi bus stop?
The bus stop is here.
You pass the next street and turn at the second one.
Shirai's house is here.
Is it a quiet street?
Yes, especially at night.
It's 8:30 now.
See him home at 11:00 and drop him off at this corner.
Two and a half hours is plenty of time.
Plenty of time for what?
Do I need to spell it out?
Wada!
You Shirai?
Answer me.
You're Shirai, right?
Get in.
Where are you taking me?
Why have you brought me here?
I want to see you die here.
I knew it.
You're doing this for the vice president.
You're wrong.
Iwabuchi hired a killer.
But you don't deserve the favor of an assassin's bullet.
Recognize that window?
- Furuya!
- That's right.
Look at the hideous way he died:
His neck broken, lying in a pool of his own blood.
The man who jumped from that window five years ago was my father!
You find that shocking?
I'm Furuya's son.
That's a lie.
He had no children.
I was illegitimate.
My father hid his relationship with my mother.
I can't believe it.
You're the vice president's -
It wasn't easy leaping into a snake pit like this.
The real Koichi Nishi is elsewhere.
He and I exchanged identities.
For five years now,
I've lived only to avenge my father's death.
I carry this picture with me always.
The poor man.
The law couldn't bring you to justice, but I'll do it with my own bare hands.
I'll start by making you break your own damned neck.
Moriyama and I were just following Iwabuchi's orders -
You forced my father to kill himself.
No, I just -
The truth!
By threats or pleas you convinced him to kill himself, didn't you?
- No.
- Liar!
I arranged that cake for my own wedding.
Your panic when it appeared confirmed everything.
Was that... what you intended... for me too?
Forgive me!
Time to jump and break your neck.
This drink's spiked with poison.
You hardly deserve the luxury, but it'll be quick.
What'll it be?
Jump out the window?
Or swallow this, sitting in the very chair my father sat in?
Wada, you make him drink it.
You've certainly earned the right.
Please forgive him.
He has a wife and children too.
And what about you?
What about your family?
No, this is enough.
I forgive him.
Forgive?
How dare you!
Who gave you the right to forgive him?
You were in on their crooked schemes.
So was my father.
They tamed my father and you with scraps from their table and offered you up as scapegoats, yet you can't hate them.
This is the only message scum like them understand.
Even now they sleep soundly, grins on their faces.
I won't stand for it!
I can never hate them enough!
How can you be so brutal?
It's just whiskey.
The shock was too much for him.
He's lost his mind.
I had other plans for him, but this'll do.
They'll find him this way in the morning, here on the seventh floor.
The papers will have a field day.
Watch Iwabuchi and Moriyama's blood pressure spike.
Wada, have a drink.
Let's celebrate.
Not a single line.
They hushed it up.
That government office tipped off Iwabuchi this morning.
Public Corp. 's in bed with them too.
The bastards.
And to top it all off, Moriyama and I had to go get Shirai.
We took him to an insane asylum.
Acute schizophrenia triggered by a profound shock.
That was his diagnosis.
Worst of all, he keeps apologizing to Furuya.
Furuya?
"Furuya, forgive me," over and over.
It just doesn't make any sense.
What was Shirai doing in that seventh-floor office?
The door was locked from the outside.
He'd never go there voluntarily.
Then who was it?
Sir... maybe Shirai didn't steal anything from the vault.
Maybe it was that same unknown person.
Why?
When you think about it, there's a common thread running through these strange events.
The cake at the wedding, the postcard inside the box, the office where Shirai was found and his inexplicable behavior.
They're all tied to Furuya, which means that someone is doing these things in retaliation for Furuya's death.
That's my conclusion.
It makes sense in theory, but who would do that for Furuya?
That's just it.
I believe his widow was the only one to survive him.
Still, under the circumstances, I'd better double-check on that.
I'm too soft.
I should have thrown Shirai out that window.
If I had, the papers would be all over Iwabuchi and Moriyama by now.
I guess I don't hate them enough.
Something's not quite right about you.
You're going against your nature.
It's not easy hating evil.
You have to stoke your own fury until you become evil yourself.
There's nothing wrong with hating evil, but you're sacrificing innocent bystanders.
Yoshiko-san, for example.
You married her as a weapon.
What if she finds out your real motive?
Shut up!
What are you shouting about?
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with Iwabuchi's daughter.
Hit the nail on the head, huh?
Unfortunately.
Nothing unfortunate about it.
It's an excellent development.
She may be your enemy's daughter, but if you're in love, then love her.
It's childish to let that get you all knotted up.
So the prosecutor's fallen in love with the defendant's daughter.
Fine.
Just don't get hung up on it.
On our wedding night -
On our wedding night, we -
Well, given Yoshiko's condition, we skipped the normal honeymoon and spent the night at Iwabuchi's house.
I was touched by how she waited so innocently in our bedroom.
She lay there, rigid as a doll... her face pale.
Her eyes were closed tight, and she was trembling.
I realized I couldn't take advantage of this girl.
Ever since -
You asshole!
That's worse than torturing her.
Hold on a minute.
I was wrong.
I've been torn in two ever since.
I've even had second thoughts.
So I've forced my own anger, becoming more brutal than I needed to.
I want vengeance for my father, but that's not all.
I want those villains brought to justice for the sake of all the helpless people who don't even know they've been had.
Remember how driven I was when I asked you to exchange identities?
Where's all that gone?
I make myself sick.
If you think you've gone wrong, start over.
I don't need this anymore.
That's the spirit.
So now what?
It'd be great to blast apart Moriyama, Iwabuchi and the head honcho himself in one fell swoop.
I'll use myself for dynamite.
The fact Iwabuchi sent me to clean up after Shirai proves he's begun to really trust me.
If I sit tight and play my cards right, I'll get to the bottom of their schemes.
And then - bang!
In the meantime, you might as well love that bride of yours.
Make tonight your real honeymoon.
Buy her a bouquet on me.
I must tell you,
Furuya has been constantly in my thoughts lately.
And, of course, I've been worried about you.
Thank you so much.
I manage to get along somehow.
But it can't be easy, a single woman, managing these apartments by yourself.
I don't remember Furuya having any relatives other than yourself.
The truth is, I've never told you this before, but my husband did have a child who never lived with us.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to pry in any way.
Not at all.
Being alone like this at my age,
I long to meet him.
I'd even like him to live with me if he would.
It was a boy.
Come to think of it, he must be a man by now.
That part of my husband's life happened long before we got married.
And where are the woman and her son now?
If only I knew.
In fact, I believe the mother passed away, so the son must be all alone in the world.
Truly all alone.
Illegitimate - is that the word?
Couldn't even use my husband's name.
I hate to impose on your kindness by asking this, but couldn't you somehow find the boy?
It would make me - No, it would make Furuya so happy.
What was the woman's name?
Itakura.
I believe she went by Itakura.
Do you have anything else to go on?
That's absolutely everything I know.
I hated her so much, I couldn't stand to know anything about her.
I never dreamed that time would change my feelings this way.
Don't you even have a picture of the boy?
You do?
These are pictures from Furuya's funeral, so maybe -
Yes, this one, just as the hearse was driving away.
This man is by himself, away from the mourners, standing behind that telephone pole.
That face.
It looks so sad.
No, anguished.
He must have been a relative.
Do you think just maybe he was Furuya's son?
I'd like a bouquet, please.
It's for a couple of newlyweds.
Where's Nishi?
Not home yet.
Cut it out, Father.
What do you mean?
Stop making Nishi do your dirty work.
- I don't understand.
- Don't play dumb.
He's out late every night.
Last night it was 2:00 a. m.
2:00 a.
M?
What the hell are you making him do?
- Imagine how Yoshiko feels.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
And that fuss this morning, sending him out with Moriyama before dawn.
That's strange.
What can Nishi be up to?
What is it?
- Moriyama-san is here.
- Send him in.
You mean to say Nishi is Furuya's son?
His real name's Itakura, but there's no doubt at all.
Wait a minute.
He was out last night until 2:00.
Just about the time Shirai was found on the seventh floor.
It all fits perfectly.
Furuya's son is using your daughter for revenge.
But his legal name is Nishi, not Itakura.
Itakura.
Welcome home.
Don't move, damn it!
Tatsuo, what's wrong?
Out of the way, Yoshiko.
He's using you.
You're just a pawn for his vengeance.
Stop!
You should've kept up the pretense.
We'd have handled it.
I intended to, but as I've explained -
How did you, of all people, accept such an absurd match for Yoshiko?
We conducted an investigation.
There was no cause for suspicion of any kind.
What did he used to do?
He had a used-car dealership.
A broker, huh?
What became of the dealership?
He sold it when he came to work for me.
That's the only thing we have to go on.
Moriyama's already checking on it.
Hello.
What is it?
It's Nishi.
Iwabuchi here.
What did he have to say?
- He's got Moriyama.
- What?
And Wada's still alive.
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
Quit your whining.
You only have yourself to blame.
If you hadn't exposed my identity, I'd never have treated you like this.
You just stumbled into our hands at a critical moment.
- Kidnapping is a serious crime.
- That's right.
It's pointless trying to use the law against evil people.
I've racked up plenty of crimes.
Identity fraud, matrimonial fraud, unlawful detention.
Illegal entry, blackmail, kidnapping.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
I can turn myself in with my head held high.
Turn yourself in?
I'll lay it all out for you.
After you've spilled the beans, I'll call a press conference.
A press conference?
I'll start by introducing Wada.
"Wada of Public Corp. Found alive. "
Good headline.
Next I'll introduce myself.
"Iwabuchi's son-in-law and secretary - whose own father was murdered five years ago - uncovers massive corruption at the Public Corp. For Land Development. "
And finally, you.
"Moriyama corroborates evidence of corruption at Public Corp. "
Press coverage whips public opinion into a frenzy.
I turn myself in and cooperate with the authorities at my leisure from the comfort of my cell.
- And if I refuse to talk?
- I'll make you!
And I play rough!
A forced confession isn't binding.
Think I don't know that?
But if I've got material evidence, the prosecutor will accept it in the end.
Even Wada knows Shirai pocketed seven million.
You probably got twice that, at least 15.
Where's it all stashed?
In your position, it'd take 10 years of self-denial to set aside 15 million.
That sum alone is material evidence of graft.
And another thing.
The day after they searched Dairyu and arrested Wada, you came flying into Iwabuchi's office, your face all pale.
I could hear Iwabuchi raging at you, "Can't you even handle this?"
You came out of his office stuffing 10 bankbooks into your briefcase.
No doubt the kickbacks are divided among all those accounts.
If we could track those down, there'd be no better proof.
But Shirai just spilled the beans.
Liar.
I'm the only one -
No one else knows?
Not even Iwabuchi?
Why, thank you.
Now we've got all our ducks in a nice neat row.
So of course Iwabuchi doesn't know where you stashed your 15-odd million.
In other words, as long as we've got you,
Iwabuchi can't touch that valuable evidence.
So we'll just sit back and wait until Moriyama here decides to come clean.
Stop, you sons of bitches!
Hey, open up!
Open up!
Remember how shocked we were when we crawled out after the carpet-bombing?
The factory had been destroyed.
We were surrounded by a sea of flames.
I still have nightmares about that hellish scene.
Me too.
But time sure flies.
It's already been 15 years since they yanked us out of high school to man that factory.
Look at that smokestack.
You and I slugged it out for real over there.
You were an arrogant asshole.
So were you.
- But once we started fighting -
- I wasn't such an asshole after all?
Remember our bicycle cart without even a tire left?
Sure I do.
That cart was the only thing that kept us fed after the war.
Wada, we used to haul industrial oil out of here in that cart to sell to the fancy villas.
It was gone in seconds.
We managed to make that money grow.
Provisions brokers, textile brokers, steel brokers.
With my family up north wiped out in a naval bombardment and this guy a bastard child, we made a perfect team.
Although we never saw eye to eye on going to college.
But your degree sure came in handy.
Thanks to your name and history,
I managed to marry Iwabuchi's daughter.
This place brings back memories!
It was a mistake for him to fall in love with her.
You really think so?
From her point of view, if she knew he really loved her, that she wasn't just being used, that would at least be some consolation.
I met the young lady twice while planning the wedding.
She's a genuinely sweet person.
When I think of her agony,
I wish a peaceful resolution were possible.
Unfortunately there just isn't any way.
Forget the daughter.
That man's evil.
If we hesitate, we're finished!
Are you trying to starve me?
Of course not.
We figured you'd be too anxious to have an appetite.
Cut the crap!
You've starved me for two whole days.
- Would you eat?
- Of course.
We haven't got much to offer.
You like ham and eggs on toast?
Anything!
Ham and eggs on toast will run you a cool 15 million.
Fifteen million?
Surely you're not shocked?
"Always get a kickback. " That's your policy, isn't it?
Your share of the Dairyu kickbacks came to 15 million.
Until you tell us where it's stashed, no ham and eggs.
What's wrong?
I'm terrified.
If you keep this up, where will it lead?
You're up against a terrifying system that will never yield.
Having worked inside it for 25 years, I know that in my guts.
Everyone feels that way and gives up.
That's how they get away with it.
Open up!
Hey, open the door!
Changed your mind?
Like hell!
I'll die before I tell you anything!
Then there's no point.
Seaweed canisters?
1,650 ten-thousand yen notes - would that be about this high?
Wrapped in plastic, sealed with tape, stuffed in ceramic pots.
You greedy old codger.
Buried in the east corner of the yard, under the holly tree.
You positive?
Under the holly tree?
Sounds like a fairy tale.
By the way, do you have a dog?
We'll go check it out tonight.
What's the big idea, leaving me locked up in here?
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
The bankbooks.
What became of those?
You'll stay until you tell us.
- That's absurd!
I have no idea!
Nothing like a full belly.
Will there be any special requests for room service next time?
Goddamn you!
No matter how hard you lean on him, he'll never talk.
You don't understand bureaucrats.
A good official never implicates a superior, no matter what the cost.
How touching.
So corruption continues unchecked, and the fat cats brazenly steal public funds.
There's happily ever after for you.
Please don't be sarcastic.
It's hard on me too.
I'm losing my grip.
Who am I?
Am I alive or dead?
At least you've got plans for the future.
- And you don't?
- I don't know anymore.
I know I'd like to see my wife and daughter, but I can't.
Sure you can.
Get Moriyama to come clean and you and I can turn ourselves in.
But who knows what'll happen if I do?
I can't do it.
Unmasking a superior - it's impossible.
And what about Yoshiko-san?
She'll never understand.
If you expose her father, she'll never forgive you.
Enough, you old fool!
You can't get to Nishi with your sob stories.
He's not a petty bureaucrat like you.
He's gone.
Time to move out.
- Move out?
- Wada ran away.
Why would he do that?
He's no longer human, a functionary.
An alien creature molded by bureaucracy.
After everything he's been through, he's still loyal.
See that?
Serves you right!
Quiet!
The exertion will only make you hungry!
Someone's coming!
You got your pistol?
No, I left it at Iwabuchi's.
Hey, I'm in here!
You realize what a serious risk you just took?
I felt sorry for Nishi-san and Yoshiko-san.
Liar!
Bringing in the woman to sweet-talk him - a low tactic.
How'd you contact her?
By phone.
I coaxed her out, then brought her here by cab.
- You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes, of course.
Wada, make another phone call.
This time go straight to Iwabuchi.
I'll give you five - no, ten million.
And that's not all.
I'll recommend you for Shirai's job and throw in a promotion too.
I... heard about everything from Wada-san.
I'm... so very happy.
Happier than you can imagine.
But my father -
Is he really such a bad person?
Please, tell me the truth.
Tatsuo sometimes says the same thing.
Is that really what Father is like?
So it's true, then.
But he's always been a wonderful father to me.
Yoshiko!
Could you forgive my father if I begged you to?
No, I'm sorry.
That's what Wada-san wanted me to say.
But I could never ask that of you.
When I think of your father, it's only natural that you hate mine.
But I can't hate him myself.
What are we going to do?
Life is so ironic.
I don't just mean our relationship.
My relationship with my father too.
Let me tell you the story of my father's life.
Even though he had my mother and me, he married someone his boss suggested in order to get ahead.
That's the kind of man he was.
I didn't know I was illegitimate until I applied to high school.
I always thought my father was dead.
When I found out that the man I'd known as my uncle was my father, my whole world went black.
I never wanted to see him again, so whenever he came to visit, I would run away.
After my mother's death, I wouldn't see him.
But then... five years ago...
I don't even know how he managed to find me, but he suddenly turned up at my place.
Later I realized he wanted to make peace with me before he died.
He kept apologizing, his eyes full of tears.
I didn't know why he'd come.
I lashed out at him and then stormed out.
The next day,
I read about his suicide in the paper.
Then an envelope arrived.
Inside was a bankbook in my name.
The account held 1.5 million yen.
A lot of money for someone in his position.
Probably kickbacks.
But now I'm overwhelmed by how much he cared for me.
The more I regret lashing out at him, the more his words and gestures I remember from my childhood seem like signs of his love for me.
My obsession with him after his death was as strong as my hatred for him while he was alive.
That's what's driven me to go this far.
I've used my inheritance to finance this scheme.
It was the only thing I could do with that money.
I'll go tell my father that he must make amends for all these sins.
I don't think he's capable of that.
Then what can I do?
Yoshiko.
If you really want your father to make amends, let me take care of it.
It may seem unbearable to allow me to expose his deeds, but it's the only way he'll ever make up for what he's done.
Yes.
As you say, right now my hands are tied.
Yes, I understand that perfectly.
In the worst case, I will take my own life.
I wouldn't think of dragging you into this.
What?
It was kind of you to have the drug delivered to me, even going to the trouble of indicating dosage.
I am much obliged.
The fact is, my nerves have been getting the better of me.
Tonight, thanks to your consideration,
I'll take a small dose and sleep peacefully.
Hello?
Welcome home.
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?
Yoshiko never goes anywhere.
Where was she?
I don't know.
When did she leave?
After she got a phone call just after noon.
Who was it?
I don't know.
The caller didn't give his name.
He simply asked to speak to your daughter.
And Tatsuo?
He woke up at 2:00 in an awful mood, took his gun and went out.
He was wearing hunting clothes.
That'll be all.
Where's Nishi?
You'd better tell me.
Tatsuo left with his rifle, swearing he'd get Nishi.
Yoshiko, where's Nishi?
Didn't you go see him?
I'm afraid Tatsuo followed you to track down Nishi.
If that's not it,
I don't know what to do next.
What on earth is Tatsuo planning?
This is just punishment for all the harm I've done.
I should have resolved long ago to turn myself in and make amends.
If I had, this never would have -
I can't bear to sit here like this.
Father, it's true.
I did go to see Nishi.
What?
Really?
There's hope, then.
Where is he?
I'll go with you.
No, leave this to me.
You can barely stand.
No, I'm going with you.
Have some of this wine.
Drink it all, quickly.
Wait here while I call for the car.
I need the car right away.
What's wrong?
You're in no condition to go out.
No, I'm -
Yoshiko, there's no time.
Leave this to me.
Where's Nishi?
Tell me now!
Where is he?
The ruins of that munitions factory... in Musashihara.
I put your bride in a taxi.
We've got to get out of here.
Don't panic.
We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
So he finally talked, huh?
He says he left the bankbooks in a safe at the Muraki Inn in Tsukuji.
The Muraki Inn?
Damn!
He's a sly old fox!
Let's go have a look.
The inn will be a breeze.
The holly thorns cut me up bad while I dug for those pots stuffed with cash.
After the inn, it's straight to the papers.
Right.
And after the press conference, we all move into the pen.
That'll be the safest place.
I'm leaving the car.
Yoshiko.
What's going on?
Why are you sleeping here?
Tatsuo!
Nishi!
Where's Nishi?
Did you see Father?
Dad?
You didn't see him!
Did you shoot Nishi?
What?
Are you still half asleep?
I just got these.
So you weren't out looking for Nishi?
If I knew where that jerk was, I'd beat the crap out of him.
Why would Father lie to me?
What did Dad do?
Tell me!
Tatsuo, what are you thinking?
What do you think has happened?
We'll know when we get there.
I'm so frightened.
I want to trust Father.
So do I.
It was you, wasn't it?
You told them where Nishi was.
Congratulations.
Thanks to you, Nishi's been murdered.
Don't blame her.
Our father tricked her into telling.
Tricked her, did he?
Now all of Japan can be tricked the same way.
You must've seen it on your way here - that car flattened into scrap by a freight train.
Nishi was in that car!
You don't believe me?
I'll show you, then.
I'll show you what they did to him.
Look.
The signs of his last stand against them!
There's more.
Take a close look.
That bottle of alcohol and the broken syringe.
I think -
No, I'm positive.
Nishi -
They pinned him down.
Then... they shot him full of grain alcohol.
Then they dumped him in the car I'd left as a precaution and aimed him, unconscious, toward the tracks.
Drunk driving.
His sense of justice and all his hard work will be consigned to oblivion and his name dragged in the mud!
Yoshiko!
You're Tatsuo... right?
I'm Itakura.
Actually, my real name's Nishi.
But now I can't ever go back to being myself.
Listen to me.
The car Nishi died in was mine.
It was registered to Nishi.
So Nishi died in Nishi's car.
I'm Itakura now.
I can't testify to anything.
How could this happen?
Nishi was murdered last night - that much is certain.
Yet even though it's a fact... there's nothing I can do about it.
They killed Wada too.
Wada?
The assistant.
He was here last night, but now he's gone.
He was already thought to be dead.
Easy enough to get rid of him.
And Moriyama, who spilled his guts last night - they took him away too.
By now they've probably destroyed all material evidence.
I know everything.
It's horrifying that it's all so simple and yet so foul!
But I don't have a single shred of evidence.
There's nothing I can say, nothing I can do!
Goddamn it!
How can this be?
How can this be?
Apparently they found high levels of alcohol in his blood.
I find that impossible to believe.
Not Nishi.
As far as I'm concerned, he was irreplaceable.
And it's not nepotism that makes me laud his ability and effectiveness.
He was the perfect secretary.
And I've lost not only a model employee, but a son-in-law too.
I can only say that I'm stunned.
By the way, a man named Nishi called all the papers last night to announce a press conference.
That was done... at my own behest.
But given what's transpired, it can wait until another time.
Iwabuchi here.
What do you two want?
- I wish I had my rifle.
- What?
If I had my rifle, I could shoot you.
What is this nonsense?
Look at Yoshiko.
When you killed Nishi, you killed her too.
- Yoshiko.
- Stay back!
She's no longer your daughter, and I'm no longer your son.
We never want to see your face again.
That's all I came to say.
Tatsuo!
Yoshiko!
Yes, Iwabuchi speaking.
Please forgive the interruption.
Everything's been laid to rest.
I'm sorry for all the concern I caused you.
And with respect to my own position,
I believe I should resign for the good of Public Corp.
What?
Go abroad temporarily?
Yes, yes.
That's actually exactly what I had in mind.
I do hope you'll consider my future upon my return.
Good night, then.
Oh, my mistake.
I didn't sleep at all last night and seem to have mistaken night for day.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

NISHI AND IWABUCHI WEDDING PARTY
The ceremony is almost over.
This way, please.
- Have the Dairyu executives arrived?
- Yes.
- Where?
- In the hall?
Over there, in the reception area.
In front of the screen, by the pine tree.
- We want to see them immediately.
- Just for a minute.
So we don't disturb the banquet.
Excuse me.
Please make way for the bride and groom.
- The banquet's about to begin.
- Quick!
A police detective!
What's all this about?
Why cover the wedding of the daughter of Public Corporation's vice president?
- Don't play dumb.
They're both here.
- Who is?
You searched Dairyu and nabbed their accountant.
- Is the president or director next?
- Or both?
Excuse me.
Get a shot of them busting him.
Wada, get back to your seat.
I can't run the party without you.
Sir... the party program is outlined here.
- Who is that?
- Someone from Dairyu?
No, he's with Public Corp.
That's Wada, assistant chief of contracts.
That's Wada, right?
Hello.
News desk?
Here's a twist:
An arrest in Public Corp. 's contracts division.
The Public Corporation for Land Development.
That's right:
Assistant chief of contracts at Public Corp.
This is bigger than just embezzlement at Dairyu Construction.
It's obviously a kickback scheme between Dairyu and Public Corp.
Yes, I'll stay on the story.
Now that the ceremony is duly completed, we will commence the wedding feast.
I, Shirai, chief of contracts for Public Corporation, hereby undertake to serve, however poorly, as master of ceremonies.
First, our president, Arimura, who acted as matchmaker, will present the bride and groom.
Please allow me to present the couple.
The bridegroom, Koichi Nishi, who stands here beside me, hardly needs me to enumerate the skills he has displayed as Vice President Iwabuchi's secretary.
He only became secretary after his engagement.
I just heard that at the reception desk.
Nishi, who lost his family to the war...
What did this Nishi do before?
Unclear.
He's a pal of Iwabuchi's son.
What's the son do?
Nothing.
The infamous prodigal son.
He's the one who shocked everyone by catching the bride before she fell.
Nishi's future prospects glow brightly indeed.
As for his lovely bride, Yoshiko, she is a talented alumna of Keitoku Girls School and is not only exquisite, but also a rare paragon of unsullied innocence.
There's a senryu verse that goes:
"The bride is beautiful - that is, with dowry in hand. "
Don't be so cruel.
The groom is the cruel one.
He only married her to guarantee his own success.
On this most auspicious of days...
Auspicious indeed!
- And him?
- Moriyama, top administrator.
As great as the joy of both families must already be, we, the employees of Public Corporation, extend to them our most sincere congratulations.
For it is now three years since our corporation first...
Who's that?
Iwabuchi, vice president.
An assistant chief in contracts, his boss, the administrator, and the vice president.
It all adds up.
Iwabuchi-san, the new father-in-law...
Wait.
It's all coming back now.
Five years ago, that illegal bid on government construction.
An assistant, Furuya, jumped from a seventh-story window, but they covered it up.
Back then, Iwabuchi was division head, with Moriyama and Shirai under him.
The "Clean-Up Trio" of graft.
Then they all landed equivalent positions at Public Corp...
Nice little racket they've got going.
Now Moriyama-san will propose a toast to the newlyweds.
I'm actually among you today to stand in for the groom's father.
Someone more appropriate should propose the toast.
Enough formalities.
Get on with your toast.
Yes.
Hardly the time for him to be making a toast.
If it's not too presumptuous,
I'll toast to the bride and groom's future.
Cheers!
- Congratulations.
Another arrest?
Hey, he's with Dairyu Construction.
Did the police let him go?
Now let's take congratulations from our assembled guests.
First, Hatano-san, president of Dairyu Construction.
As you've been told,
I am Hatano of Dairyu Construction.
Today we sit among distinguished guests from political, government and business circles.
I am insignificant in comparison.
To be accorded the unexpected honor of speaking first leaves me dumbfounded.
He's really sweating his way through this one.
As for our relationship with Public Corporation,
Public found our fair and upright approach to business compatible with their own founding principles.
We've set aside profits in the interest of long-term goals and cooperated to achieve our present success.
The thing is, what I'd most like to say is
I have no personal ties to Public Corp.
Some toast.
Like he's pleading his case to the prosecutor.
It's difficult to find the right words, but I offer my most sincere congratulations.
May the bride and groom forge a strong marital bond and find great happiness together.
These are my congratulations, brief though they may be.
Next, the bridegroom's friend will speak on behalf of his circle.
He is also the bride's brother.
Tatsuo Iwabuchi will now offer congratulatory remarks.
Traditionally, in making a wedding toast, we stick to the same old sugarcoated clichés.
Frankly, my father isn't crazy about aspects of Nishi's past outlined in a detective agency's report.
But then it's not my father who's getting married.
My father has to accept that Yoshiko's in love with him.
Fact is, I love Nishi too.
We became friends a year and a half ago when I bought a used sports car from his tiny car dealership.
Since then, I've learned that Nishi has a rare sense of justice.
Rumors are flying about this wedding, about Nishi using my sister's disability to boost himself up the corporate ladder.
But I swear it can't be true.
I'm firmly convinced of that.
Hey, Nishi.
I'm counting on you to look after my sister.
She's had a tough life.
I may be a mess, but I'd do anything to protect her.
Listen, Nishi.
If you make my sister unhappy,
I swear I'll kill you!
A bit unconventional perhaps, but a great speech, brimming with passion.
Now it's time for the bride and groom to cut the wedding cake.
Yet another cake.
That's a strange one.
Must be a business gift.
Hey, looks like that ministry building.
Look, there's a rose on the seventh floor.
That's the window that guy jumped from.
What is it, Shirai?
Get on with it!
Yes... yes.
Allow me to replace that.
Helluva wedding.
Truly bizarre.
Best one-act I've ever seen.
One-act?
This is just the prelude.

PROSECUTION CALLS FOR CONTINUED DETENTION OF EXECS
EXECS' RELEASE PENDING - PROSECUTOR RUNNING OUT OF TIME
Wada-san, who on earth have you been protecting with your three weeks of silence?
You work for Public Corporation.
Like any government official, you have a duty to serve the public interest.
The 12 billion you guys gave Dairyu for construction costs were taxes the public paid with their sweat and blood.
Legitimate expenses are one thing.
But there's no question that the bidding was rigged.
All the other bids came in between 8.5 and nine billion.
Only Dairyu's 12-billion bid matched what Public Corp. Had estimated.
It fit like a glove.
Three billion higher than the others.
On top of that, you required all the bidders to submit complete itemized budgets immediately.
If they couldn't, you rejected them as unprofessional.
You handed that job to Dairyu on a silver platter.
This is an outrage!
A reckless waste of the public's hard-earned money!
You owe it to the public to reveal everything you know.
You're in charge of Public Corp. 's contracts.
No bidding scheme could have proceeded without your participation.
You're an expert in budgeting.
Bidders want that information badly.
I'll make an educated guess and say the idea to demand itemized budgets from Dairyu's competitors could only have come from an old business hand like you.
We're both a bit tired.
By the way, don't you live over in Zoshigaya?
I ran across this.
A receipt from the Hatsufune Restaurant's regular taxi company.
Of course the date, destination and time are all here.
"October 7, from Hatsufune to Zoshigaya. "
And another fare on the same date to Kamimachi.
Isn't that where your boss lives?
Then, on the same day, a fare to Nishiogikubo.
That's Moriyama's neighborhood, isn't it?
And this one to Shibuya, where Vice President Iwabuchi lives.
Wada-san, what am I to make of all this?
Hatsufune's books indicate Dairyu covered it all.
Sticking with your silence?
Look at this stack of receipts from other days.
PROSECUTOR NONAKA
Yes?
Special delivery.
Anonymous.
Something else from our informer.
"Look at taxi receipts from Hatsufune's regular company. "
Incredible.
One step behind us, but right on track.
Who could it be?
The tips are always right on target.
Most informers are rivals using slander for revenge.
This seems different.
Maybe it's from the same person the reporters mentioned who pulled off that wedding cake stunt.
No clue who sent that cake, right?
No, all we've got is the name of the bakery, an order describing the design, its destination, the date, and the alarming amount of cash delivered to pay for it.
Come in.
Still nothing?
He seemed like the perfect way to get to the Iwabuchi-Moriyama-Shirai clique.
How about Miura?
What'll we do?
We can't keep holding them.
We'll let Wada go.
And Miura?
Switch his charge to embezzlement and squeeze him harder.
We've discovered 23 million in undocumented payments on Dairyu's books.
Miura in accounting can't explain them.
Clear grounds for embezzlement charges.
If they were bribes, he could claim they were development costs and eventually return to the business.
But if he lined his own pockets with company funds, he'll never work again.
If we charge him with embezzlement, he'll talk.
So release him and then -
Releasing him and arresting him again is a dirty trick, but his tactics are even dirtier.
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER
That must have been an ordeal.
Miura-san, another warrant for you.
I'm his lawyer.
Embezzlement?
Before I came to meet you, the president, the other top executives, and I anticipated this very eventuality.
The president said that if it were to happen,
I should give you the following message.
He was quite adamant about it.
He said, "I know you'll see this through to the bitter end. "
Stop!
Prosecutor, any comment on Miura's suicide?
Your statement was short on detail.
- Did Miura really kill himself?
- He did.
Prosecutor, isn't this an advance in the art of murder?
That message the president sent with his lawyer right before Miura's suicide -
"I know you'll see this through to the bitter end" - might as well have been a bullet from a high-powered rifle.
This was, in fact, an assassination.
This was - in fact - nothing but a suicide.
Just a minute.
Aren't you concerned Wada will be next?
After his release, Wada met with Moriyama and Shirai.
He has yet to return home.
Can you confirm that he's safe?
Any word of his whereabouts?
We're conducting a thorough investigation.
IN CONFERENCE
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
SITE THREE
Forgive me.
I'll do it right now.
You've become a real lapdog, haven't you?
You'd kill yourself just because Moriyama and Shirai told you to.
Those masters you so loyally serve are celebrating even now.
To Iwabuchi, Moriyama and Shirai, you're just a nuisance, a walking liability they want to be rid of.
But listen to me:
Cattle and swine die kinder deaths!
I don't understand.
How can you say such things when you're -
When I'm Iwabuchi's son-in-law?
What'll it be?
You wanna die?
WADA OF PUBLIC CORPORATION COMMITS SUICIDE
DO SUICIDES PROVE CORRUPTION?
A SECOND VICTIM, FAST ON MIURA'S HEELS
UNDERLINGS SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO CONTAIN SCANDAL
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
What are your thoughts on Wada's suicide?
I grieve for him deeply.
Is that all?
First we had Miura's suicide, followed by Wada's.
Fairly convenient developments for Dairyu and Public Corporation.
What does that mean?
This way the bribery investigation goes up in smoke, just like five years ago with the ministry building contract.
Don't let your imagination run away with you, my friend.
Your statements are groundless.
You think so?
The public isn't so sure.
They wonder if those two really had to die.
You're barking up the wrong tree... with these questions.
Miura killed himself after three weeks of interrogation when they released him, only to serve him with another warrant.
As for Wada,
I gather he was an earnest man with a meek personality.
An innocent man accused of dishonesty, on the verge of a breakdown when he was released.
What drove these two men to their deaths?
Why don't you ask the prosecutor's office for the truth?
N. I. AUTO SALES AND SERVICE
Yes, a Chrysler.
No, a New Yorker won't do.
Has to be an Imperial.
Black exterior, gray interior.
Got that?
You should eat something.
What kind of person is Nishi?
Given his relationship to the vice president, I just don't -
Why did he save me?
I mean, what did he accomplish?
Please tell me.
Just what kind of person is he?
And what kind of person are you?
What's your relationship to him?
My relationship with Nishi?
It's very complex and mysterious.
Time to go.
- Where?
- Your funeral.
I just dropped off an offering on behalf of Iwabuchi and the firm.
They've put on quite a show.
A five-tier altar, three priests, and two huge wreaths courtesy of Public Corp.
A beautiful funeral.
I knew it.
And here you are -
Dairyu would've liked to send flowers in celebration, but that would've been a bit obvious.
Why are you doing this to me?
This is sheer torment.
I'd rather be dead.
Please, let me die.
I have to die.
Wasting this fine funeral -
Calm down, now.
There's something I want you to hear.
You've been to Noir, right?
The bar run by Moriyama's mistress?
This is Moriyama and Shirai talking there last night.
What, you come to this kind of place?
And so soon after getting married?
You've caught me red-handed.
I'm ready for a dance.
Now, now.
No need to rush off.
That's when I placed a briefcase with this tape recorder inside it under their table.
I'll play their conversation for you after they arrive for the funeral.
Public Corp. 's official car.
Chief Shirai!
Moriyama!
Man, oh, man, what a relief.
You were born with a gift for persuasion.
That sounds awful.
Look who's talking.
You left him no choice but suicide.
Cut it out.
No need to spell it out like that.
Let's drink and enjoy ourselves tonight.
Still, it all leaves a bad taste in my mouth somehow.
Get yourself a young girl, the best remedy for a day like today.
Wada, still ready to die for them and let them go scot-free?
Don't you want revenge?
- Revenge?
- That's right.
You and me together.
Drinking so early?
Did you see the papers?
Makes me feel like crap.
A drunk needs no excuse to drink.
I wish I had your blind faith in Dad.
What the papers hint at can't be true.
Our father couldn't possibly -
He's been a good father to you.
Loved you enough for two after Mom died.
Is he a bad father to you?
No, he's a good father to me too, which is why this drives me so crazy.
Let's drop the subject.
A baby like you can only trust blindly.
I'm not a baby.
Oh, excuse me.
Lady of the house, is it?
What's wrong?
Are you happy?
Does Nishi...
love you?
You sure?
Yes.
Why do you ask?
If he loves you, that's all that matters.
The prosecution seems to have let up, and the matter's closed.
I'm sorry for allowing this to cause you such concern.
Who?
The president?
I'll give the old man a vague report at some point.
No doubt he'll hold forth about earnest principles and such.
I trust you'll be able to handle him.
Yes, thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Isn't it time you took off that mourning band?
And you should knock before entering, even if you are a member of the family.
That's all for today.
Make a left here.
MITSUl STORAGE
It's ready, sir.
Follow me.
- This is all very mysterious.
- Yes, I -
Just who do you think stole that five million yen in cash from the safe-deposit box in the vault?
When I found that postcard in the box,
I assumed it was probably the same person who sent that cake to the wedding banquet.
That cake had to be from one of the losing bidders.
But how could they get to the vault?
Only you and Wada knew of it.
That's just it.
We set up two - no, three levels of security to protect that deposit box.
And those were?
The key and seal to enter the vault are in a suitcase in storage.
But you need my regular office seal to access the storage room.
And here's the key to the suitcase.
I keep them both in my unlocked desk drawer.
It seemed safer than acting as if I had something to hide.
The seal and key are useless anyway unless you know about the suitcase in storage.
An ingenious plan.
Thank you.
The thing is, the complexity of the plan only implicates you more deeply.
Only you and Wada knew the whole setup.
Take away Wada and that leaves you.
No wonder Moriyama is suspicious of you.
But I
- I would never -
Calm down.
But -
By the way, do you still have the key and seal for the deposit box?
Yes.
Hand them over.
It's hardly a huge sum, but Moriyama should still investigate.
What's wrong?
Don't you have them?
No, it's just -
I thought - In my briefcase -
In your secretary's office.
Nishi speaking.
- Bring in Shirai's briefcase.
- No, I'll get it myself.
Thank you.
Just what are you doing?
Aren't the key and seal in your briefcase either?
No, it's not that.
Then show them to me.
Why won't you open it?
Seems there's something in there you don't want me to see.
Let's have a look.
I said open it!
I have no idea... how that got in my briefcase.
That's enough.
Come with me.
I don't have any -
Just follow me!
Sir, we're in Kamimachi now.
Which house is yours?
Sir?
Sir, this is Kamimachi Block 2.
Sir. that's 540 yen.
Your change.
Wada!
You expect me to believe that Wada's alive and that he took the money?
Ridiculous!
Don't say that.
It's true.
I saw him with my own eyes.
Enough of your excuses.
Wada!
Our work is done for tonight.
Isn't it fun playing a ghost?
What's wrong?
You saw him, didn't you?
Shirai's face.
Why should you care?
Aren't you happy to see him suffer?
What's the matter?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, it's Shirai-san.
See that he gets home.
I swear, I saw Wada with my own eyes.
I swear it.
Enough!
I wonder if Father's all right.
Forget Dad.
Worry about your husband.
I don't know what Nishi's up to.
He's out late every night.
He came home early last night.
Oh, you're home.
It's late.
Had to go out with the boys.
Did you go to Noir?
Yeah, something like that.
I was there all evening.
Listen, Nishi.
Yoshiko, please get some more ice.
- You're going to drink more?
I'll start a new round with Nishi.
Bring me that ice.
Hey.
Why do you two sleep in separate rooms?
The project I'm working on keeps me out till all hours.
I'd hate to wake her in the middle of the night.
What the hell are you up to?
The stakes must be awfully high.
It's written all over your face.
I know well enough that being Dad's secretary involves you in risky situations.
But listen, Nishi.
Don't risk your neck for him.
If only for Yoshiko's sake.
She's -
I feel such pity for her.
And I have only my own stupidity to blame.
When she was just this small,
I took a fall on my bike with her on the back.
It's my fault she's lame, Nishi.
She has to be happy.
I have to help her.
I'm begging you.
You've got to make her happy.
Please.
Yoshiko!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
- No, I'm sorry.
I'm fine.
Thank goodness.
Good night!
Good night.
So Shirai even hounded you at home?
Do you think my husband is still alive?
I'm terribly sorry.
I think you should give up any such hope.
But Shirai-san says he's definitely seen him.
He's hallucinating.
Your husband's death came as a great shock to him.
He's suffered a nervous breakdown.
Where's Chief Moriyama?
Shirai-san, where's Chief Moriyama?
He's in the conference room.
Vice President Iwabuchi wishes to see him.
Shirai?
You mean, he even went to you?
But I just can't -
Iwabuchi explained what happened.
But there's no reason for Shirai to swipe such a measly sum.
We've paid you more than amply.
Shirai needs a cut too.
This is nonsense!
Of course he's been rewarded handsomely.
Isn't that right?
- Yes.
A man with a full stomach doesn't bother with snacks.
We've got to stick together.
Don't go too rough on Shirai.
Let me handle him.
You can't meddle with our affairs at Public Corp.
But what if he gets desperate?
He might start blabbing to the prosecutor.
Then you're done for.
That's your choice, but don't drag us down with you.
This whole bidding scheme was your idea.
You asked us to estimate a nine-billion job at 12 billion and kick back the three billion to you.
We didn't like the idea one bit, but we like doing business with you, so we came on board.
But now you'd risk all our necks for a measly five million.
We've had enough.
You say three billion, but you've only kicked back half.
Ten percent is a standard kickback.
1.5 on 12 billion's plenty.
- But our deal was -
- Listen, Iwabuchi.
You want a political career.
You're eyeing a ministry seat.
If you get it, we'll reconsider our position.
I think we've made ourselves absolutely clear.
Let's leave the Shirai problem in Iwabuchi-san's hands.
Excuse us.
- Thank you.
Let's go.
They're rather full of themselves, I have to say.
You're one to talk.
Are you sure you've given Shirai his share?
Why, I would never -
Forget it.
Just do something about him.
- Meaning?
- Calm him down somehow.
Take him out to dinner and apologize.
Apologize?
That's what it means to be on top!
He hardly looks the part of a bad guy.
These are just about done.
It's too hot.
How's that?
Moriyama-san's on the phone.
I'll take it.
How are Nishi's performance evaluations?
Just about perfect.
But he never seems to relax and open up.
Yoshiko will loosen him up a bit, right?
By the way, Father,
I have a request.
- I hope it isn't money.
- No, it's not that.
Give up your political ambitions and retire as soon as you're a grandfather.
You're the one who'd suffer, forced to give up all your luxuries.
In that case, I'll get a job.
I'll believe that when I see it.
Moriyama-san wishes to speak to you directly.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
What?
You leave me no choice.
I'll be there.
Where are you?
What?
Suminoya?
Are you crazy?
Why in the world did you take him there?
Are you going out?
Shall I join you?
- No.
Where's Father?
He's gone out.
I'll be going out after dinner too.
Thank you for coming.
We'll call you if we need you.
I think it's what they call paranoia.
What's wrong, Shirai?
Why don't you join us?
Come, now.
Do as our vice president says.
Let's have a toast.
Everything's exactly the same.
Just like it was... five years ago.
That night Furuya sat there, you were there, and I was there.
The conversation started the same way.
"Let's have a toast. "
Don't make me laugh!
You can't talk me into jumping out a window, the way you did with Furuya.
Try that with me... and I'll spill the whole story.
Shirai, calm down now.
We've invited you here because our relationship with you has been under some strain and we'd like to improve it.
In a word, we're here out of concern for your state of mind.
The exact same words.
That's exactly how you backed Furuya into a corner.
Wada too.
You know where Shirai lives?
Draw me a map.
You know the Kamimachi bus stop?
The bus stop is here.
You pass the next street and turn at the second one.
Shirai's house is here.
Is it a quiet street?
Yes, especially at night.
It's 8:30 now.
See him home at 11:00 and drop him off at this corner.
Two and a half hours is plenty of time.
Plenty of time for what?
Do I need to spell it out?
Wada!
You Shirai?
Answer me.
You're Shirai, right?
Get in.
Where are you taking me?
Why have you brought me here?
I want to see you die here.
I knew it.
You're doing this for the vice president.
You're wrong.
Iwabuchi hired a killer.
But you don't deserve the favor of an assassin's bullet.
Recognize that window?
- Furuya!
- That's right.
Look at the hideous way he died:
His neck broken, lying in a pool of his own blood.
The man who jumped from that window five years ago was my father!
You find that shocking?
I'm Furuya's son.
That's a lie.
He had no children.
I was illegitimate.
My father hid his relationship with my mother.
I can't believe it.
You're the vice president's -
It wasn't easy leaping into a snake pit like this.
The real Koichi Nishi is elsewhere.
He and I exchanged identities.
For five years now,
I've lived only to avenge my father's death.
I carry this picture with me always.
The poor man.
The law couldn't bring you to justice, but I'll do it with my own bare hands.
I'll start by making you break your own damned neck.
Moriyama and I were just following Iwabuchi's orders -
You forced my father to kill himself.
No, I just -
The truth!
By threats or pleas you convinced him to kill himself, didn't you?
- No.
- Liar!
I arranged that cake for my own wedding.
Your panic when it appeared confirmed everything.
Was that... what you intended... for me too?
Forgive me!
Time to jump and break your neck.
This drink's spiked with poison.
You hardly deserve the luxury, but it'll be quick.
What'll it be?
Jump out the window?
Or swallow this, sitting in the very chair my father sat in?
Wada, you make him drink it.
You've certainly earned the right.
Please forgive him.
He has a wife and children too.
And what about you?
What about your family?
No, this is enough.
I forgive him.
Forgive?
How dare you!
Who gave you the right to forgive him?
You were in on their crooked schemes.
So was my father.
They tamed my father and you with scraps from their table and offered you up as scapegoats, yet you can't hate them.
This is the only message scum like them understand.
Even now they sleep soundly, grins on their faces.
I won't stand for it!
I can never hate them enough!
How can you be so brutal?
It's just whiskey.
The shock was too much for him.
He's lost his mind.
I had other plans for him, but this'll do.
They'll find him this way in the morning, here on the seventh floor.
The papers will have a field day.
Watch Iwabuchi and Moriyama's blood pressure spike.
Wada, have a drink.
Let's celebrate.
Not a single line.
They hushed it up.
That government office tipped off Iwabuchi this morning.
Public Corp. 's in bed with them too.
The bastards.
And to top it all off, Moriyama and I had to go get Shirai.
We took him to an insane asylum.
Acute schizophrenia triggered by a profound shock.
That was his diagnosis.
Worst of all, he keeps apologizing to Furuya.
Furuya?
"Furuya, forgive me," over and over.
It just doesn't make any sense.
What was Shirai doing in that seventh-floor office?
The door was locked from the outside.
He'd never go there voluntarily.
Then who was it?
Sir... maybe Shirai didn't steal anything from the vault.
Maybe it was that same unknown person.
Why?
When you think about it, there's a common thread running through these strange events.
The cake at the wedding, the postcard inside the box, the office where Shirai was found and his inexplicable behavior.
They're all tied to Furuya, which means that someone is doing these things in retaliation for Furuya's death.
That's my conclusion.
It makes sense in theory, but who would do that for Furuya?
That's just it.
I believe his widow was the only one to survive him.
Still, under the circumstances, I'd better double-check on that.
I'm too soft.
I should have thrown Shirai out that window.
If I had, the papers would be all over Iwabuchi and Moriyama by now.
I guess I don't hate them enough.
Something's not quite right about you.
You're going against your nature.
It's not easy hating evil.
You have to stoke your own fury until you become evil yourself.
There's nothing wrong with hating evil, but you're sacrificing innocent bystanders.
Yoshiko-san, for example.
You married her as a weapon.
What if she finds out your real motive?
Shut up!
What are you shouting about?
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with Iwabuchi's daughter.
Hit the nail on the head, huh?
Unfortunately.
Nothing unfortunate about it.
It's an excellent development.
She may be your enemy's daughter, but if you're in love, then love her.
It's childish to let that get you all knotted up.
So the prosecutor's fallen in love with the defendant's daughter.
Fine.
Just don't get hung up on it.
On our wedding night -
On our wedding night, we -
Well, given Yoshiko's condition, we skipped the normal honeymoon and spent the night at Iwabuchi's house.
I was touched by how she waited so innocently in our bedroom.
She lay there, rigid as a doll... her face pale.
Her eyes were closed tight, and she was trembling.
I realized I couldn't take advantage of this girl.
Ever since -
You asshole!
That's worse than torturing her.
Hold on a minute.
I was wrong.
I've been torn in two ever since.
I've even had second thoughts.
So I've forced my own anger, becoming more brutal than I needed to.
I want vengeance for my father, but that's not all.
I want those villains brought to justice for the sake of all the helpless people who don't even know they've been had.
Remember how driven I was when I asked you to exchange identities?
Where's all that gone?
I make myself sick.
If you think you've gone wrong, start over.
I don't need this anymore.
That's the spirit.
So now what?
It'd be great to blast apart Moriyama, Iwabuchi and the head honcho himself in one fell swoop.
I'll use myself for dynamite.
The fact Iwabuchi sent me to clean up after Shirai proves he's begun to really trust me.
If I sit tight and play my cards right, I'll get to the bottom of their schemes.
And then - bang!
In the meantime, you might as well love that bride of yours.
Make tonight your real honeymoon.
Buy her a bouquet on me.
I must tell you,
Furuya has been constantly in my thoughts lately.
And, of course, I've been worried about you.
Thank you so much.
I manage to get along somehow.
But it can't be easy, a single woman, managing these apartments by yourself.
I don't remember Furuya having any relatives other than yourself.
The truth is, I've never told you this before, but my husband did have a child who never lived with us.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to pry in any way.
Not at all.
Being alone like this at my age,
I long to meet him.
I'd even like him to live with me if he would.
It was a boy.
Come to think of it, he must be a man by now.
That part of my husband's life happened long before we got married.
And where are the woman and her son now?
If only I knew.
In fact, I believe the mother passed away, so the son must be all alone in the world.
Truly all alone.
Illegitimate - is that the word?
Couldn't even use my husband's name.
I hate to impose on your kindness by asking this, but couldn't you somehow find the boy?
It would make me - No, it would make Furuya so happy.
What was the woman's name?
Itakura.
I believe she went by Itakura.
Do you have anything else to go on?
That's absolutely everything I know.
I hated her so much, I couldn't stand to know anything about her.
I never dreamed that time would change my feelings this way.
Don't you even have a picture of the boy?
You do?
These are pictures from Furuya's funeral, so maybe -
Yes, this one, just as the hearse was driving away.
This man is by himself, away from the mourners, standing behind that telephone pole.
That face.
It looks so sad.
No, anguished.
He must have been a relative.
Do you think just maybe he was Furuya's son?
I'd like a bouquet, please.
It's for a couple of newlyweds.
Where's Nishi?
Not home yet.
Cut it out, Father.
What do you mean?
Stop making Nishi do your dirty work.
- I don't understand.
- Don't play dumb.
He's out late every night.
Last night it was 2:00 a. m.
2:00 a.
M?
What the hell are you making him do?
- Imagine how Yoshiko feels.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
And that fuss this morning, sending him out with Moriyama before dawn.
That's strange.
What can Nishi be up to?
What is it?
- Moriyama-san is here.
- Send him in.
You mean to say Nishi is Furuya's son?
His real name's Itakura, but there's no doubt at all.
Wait a minute.
He was out last night until 2:00.
Just about the time Shirai was found on the seventh floor.
It all fits perfectly.
Furuya's son is using your daughter for revenge.
But his legal name is Nishi, not Itakura.
Itakura.
Welcome home.
Don't move, damn it!
Tatsuo, what's wrong?
Out of the way, Yoshiko.
He's using you.
You're just a pawn for his vengeance.
Stop!
You should've kept up the pretense.
We'd have handled it.
I intended to, but as I've explained -
How did you, of all people, accept such an absurd match for Yoshiko?
We conducted an investigation.
There was no cause for suspicion of any kind.
What did he used to do?
He had a used-car dealership.
A broker, huh?
What became of the dealership?
He sold it when he came to work for me.
That's the only thing we have to go on.
Moriyama's already checking on it.
Hello.
What is it?
It's Nishi.
Iwabuchi here.
What did he have to say?
- He's got Moriyama.
- What?
And Wada's still alive.
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
Quit your whining.
You only have yourself to blame.
If you hadn't exposed my identity, I'd never have treated you like this.
You just stumbled into our hands at a critical moment.
- Kidnapping is a serious crime.
- That's right.
It's pointless trying to use the law against evil people.
I've racked up plenty of crimes.
Identity fraud, matrimonial fraud, unlawful detention.
Illegal entry, blackmail, kidnapping.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
I can turn myself in with my head held high.
Turn yourself in?
I'll lay it all out for you.
After you've spilled the beans, I'll call a press conference.
A press conference?
I'll start by introducing Wada.
"Wada of Public Corp. Found alive. "
Good headline.
Next I'll introduce myself.
"Iwabuchi's son-in-law and secretary - whose own father was murdered five years ago - uncovers massive corruption at the Public Corp. For Land Development. "
And finally, you.
"Moriyama corroborates evidence of corruption at Public Corp. "
Press coverage whips public opinion into a frenzy.
I turn myself in and cooperate with the authorities at my leisure from the comfort of my cell.
- And if I refuse to talk?
- I'll make you!
And I play rough!
A forced confession isn't binding.
Think I don't know that?
But if I've got material evidence, the prosecutor will accept it in the end.
Even Wada knows Shirai pocketed seven million.
You probably got twice that, at least 15.
Where's it all stashed?
In your position, it'd take 10 years of self-denial to set aside 15 million.
That sum alone is material evidence of graft.
And another thing.
The day after they searched Dairyu and arrested Wada, you came flying into Iwabuchi's office, your face all pale.
I could hear Iwabuchi raging at you, "Can't you even handle this?"
You came out of his office stuffing 10 bankbooks into your briefcase.
No doubt the kickbacks are divided among all those accounts.
If we could track those down, there'd be no better proof.
But Shirai just spilled the beans.
Liar.
I'm the only one -
No one else knows?
Not even Iwabuchi?
Why, thank you.
Now we've got all our ducks in a nice neat row.
So of course Iwabuchi doesn't know where you stashed your 15-odd million.
In other words, as long as we've got you,
Iwabuchi can't touch that valuable evidence.
So we'll just sit back and wait until Moriyama here decides to come clean.
Stop, you sons of bitches!
Hey, open up!
Open up!
Remember how shocked we were when we crawled out after the carpet-bombing?
The factory had been destroyed.
We were surrounded by a sea of flames.
I still have nightmares about that hellish scene.
Me too.
But time sure flies.
It's already been 15 years since they yanked us out of high school to man that factory.
Look at that smokestack.
You and I slugged it out for real over there.
You were an arrogant asshole.
So were you.
- But once we started fighting -
- I wasn't such an asshole after all?
Remember our bicycle cart without even a tire left?
Sure I do.
That cart was the only thing that kept us fed after the war.
Wada, we used to haul industrial oil out of here in that cart to sell to the fancy villas.
It was gone in seconds.
We managed to make that money grow.
Provisions brokers, textile brokers, steel brokers.
With my family up north wiped out in a naval bombardment and this guy a bastard child, we made a perfect team.
Although we never saw eye to eye on going to college.
But your degree sure came in handy.
Thanks to your name and history,
I managed to marry Iwabuchi's daughter.
This place brings back memories!
It was a mistake for him to fall in love with her.
You really think so?
From her point of view, if she knew he really loved her, that she wasn't just being used, that would at least be some consolation.
I met the young lady twice while planning the wedding.
She's a genuinely sweet person.
When I think of her agony,
I wish a peaceful resolution were possible.
Unfortunately there just isn't any way.
Forget the daughter.
That man's evil.
If we hesitate, we're finished!
Are you trying to starve me?
Of course not.
We figured you'd be too anxious to have an appetite.
Cut the crap!
You've starved me for two whole days.
- Would you eat?
- Of course.
We haven't got much to offer.
You like ham and eggs on toast?
Anything!
Ham and eggs on toast will run you a cool 15 million.
Fifteen million?
Surely you're not shocked?
"Always get a kickback. " That's your policy, isn't it?
Your share of the Dairyu kickbacks came to 15 million.
Until you tell us where it's stashed, no ham and eggs.
What's wrong?
I'm terrified.
If you keep this up, where will it lead?
You're up against a terrifying system that will never yield.
Having worked inside it for 25 years, I know that in my guts.
Everyone feels that way and gives up.
That's how they get away with it.
Open up!
Hey, open the door!
Changed your mind?
Like hell!
I'll die before I tell you anything!
Then there's no point.
Seaweed canisters?
1,650 ten-thousand yen notes - would that be about this high?
Wrapped in plastic, sealed with tape, stuffed in ceramic pots.
You greedy old codger.
Buried in the east corner of the yard, under the holly tree.
You positive?
Under the holly tree?
Sounds like a fairy tale.
By the way, do you have a dog?
We'll go check it out tonight.
What's the big idea, leaving me locked up in here?
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
The bankbooks.
What became of those?
You'll stay until you tell us.
- That's absurd!
I have no idea!
Nothing like a full belly.
Will there be any special requests for room service next time?
Goddamn you!
No matter how hard you lean on him, he'll never talk.
You don't understand bureaucrats.
A good official never implicates a superior, no matter what the cost.
How touching.
So corruption continues unchecked, and the fat cats brazenly steal public funds.
There's happily ever after for you.
Please don't be sarcastic.
It's hard on me too.
I'm losing my grip.
Who am I?
Am I alive or dead?
At least you've got plans for the future.
- And you don't?
- I don't know anymore.
I know I'd like to see my wife and daughter, but I can't.
Sure you can.
Get Moriyama to come clean and you and I can turn ourselves in.
But who knows what'll happen if I do?
I can't do it.
Unmasking a superior - it's impossible.
And what about Yoshiko-san?
She'll never understand.
If you expose her father, she'll never forgive you.
Enough, you old fool!
You can't get to Nishi with your sob stories.
He's not a petty bureaucrat like you.
He's gone.
Time to move out.
- Move out?
- Wada ran away.
Why would he do that?
He's no longer human, a functionary.
An alien creature molded by bureaucracy.
After everything he's been through, he's still loyal.
See that?
Serves you right!
Quiet!
The exertion will only make you hungry!
Someone's coming!
You got your pistol?
No, I left it at Iwabuchi's.
Hey, I'm in here!
You realize what a serious risk you just took?
I felt sorry for Nishi-san and Yoshiko-san.
Liar!
Bringing in the woman to sweet-talk him - a low tactic.
How'd you contact her?
By phone.
I coaxed her out, then brought her here by cab.
- You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes, of course.
Wada, make another phone call.
This time go straight to Iwabuchi.
I'll give you five - no, ten million.
And that's not all.
I'll recommend you for Shirai's job and throw in a promotion too.
I... heard about everything from Wada-san.
I'm... so very happy.
Happier than you can imagine.
But my father -
Is he really such a bad person?
Please, tell me the truth.
Tatsuo sometimes says the same thing.
Is that really what Father is like?
So it's true, then.
But he's always been a wonderful father to me.
Yoshiko!
Could you forgive my father if I begged you to?
No, I'm sorry.
That's what Wada-san wanted me to say.
But I could never ask that of you.
When I think of your father, it's only natural that you hate mine.
But I can't hate him myself.
What are we going to do?
Life is so ironic.
I don't just mean our relationship.
My relationship with my father too.
Let me tell you the story of my father's life.
Even though he had my mother and me, he married someone his boss suggested in order to get ahead.
That's the kind of man he was.
I didn't know I was illegitimate until I applied to high school.
I always thought my father was dead.
When I found out that the man I'd known as my uncle was my father, my whole world went black.
I never wanted to see him again, so whenever he came to visit, I would run away.
After my mother's death, I wouldn't see him.
But then... five years ago...
I don't even know how he managed to find me, but he suddenly turned up at my place.
Later I realized he wanted to make peace with me before he died.
He kept apologizing, his eyes full of tears.
I didn't know why he'd come.
I lashed out at him and then stormed out.
The next day,
I read about his suicide in the paper.
Then an envelope arrived.
Inside was a bankbook in my name.
The account held 1.5 million yen.
A lot of money for someone in his position.
Probably kickbacks.
But now I'm overwhelmed by how much he cared for me.
The more I regret lashing out at him, the more his words and gestures I remember from my childhood seem like signs of his love for me.
My obsession with him after his death was as strong as my hatred for him while he was alive.
That's what's driven me to go this far.
I've used my inheritance to finance this scheme.
It was the only thing I could do with that money.
I'll go tell my father that he must make amends for all these sins.
I don't think he's capable of that.
Then what can I do?
Yoshiko.
If you really want your father to make amends, let me take care of it.
It may seem unbearable to allow me to expose his deeds, but it's the only way he'll ever make up for what he's done.
Yes.
As you say, right now my hands are tied.
Yes, I understand that perfectly.
In the worst case, I will take my own life.
I wouldn't think of dragging you into this.
What?
It was kind of you to have the drug delivered to me, even going to the trouble of indicating dosage.
I am much obliged.
The fact is, my nerves have been getting the better of me.
Tonight, thanks to your consideration,
I'll take a small dose and sleep peacefully.
Hello?
Welcome home.
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?
Yoshiko never goes anywhere.
Where was she?
I don't know.
When did she leave?
After she got a phone call just after noon.
Who was it?
I don't know.
The caller didn't give his name.
He simply asked to speak to your daughter.
And Tatsuo?
He woke up at 2:00 in an awful mood, took his gun and went out.
He was wearing hunting clothes.
That'll be all.
Where's Nishi?
You'd better tell me.
Tatsuo left with his rifle, swearing he'd get Nishi.
Yoshiko, where's Nishi?
Didn't you go see him?
I'm afraid Tatsuo followed you to track down Nishi.
If that's not it,
I don't know what to do next.
What on earth is Tatsuo planning?
This is just punishment for all the harm I've done.
I should have resolved long ago to turn myself in and make amends.
If I had, this never would have -
I can't bear to sit here like this.
Father, it's true.
I did go to see Nishi.
What?
Really?
There's hope, then.
Where is he?
I'll go with you.
No, leave this to me.
You can barely stand.
No, I'm going with you.
Have some of this wine.
Drink it all, quickly.
Wait here while I call for the car.
I need the car right away.
What's wrong?
You're in no condition to go out.
No, I'm -
Yoshiko, there's no time.
Leave this to me.
Where's Nishi?
Tell me now!
Where is he?
The ruins of that munitions factory... in Musashihara.
I put your bride in a taxi.
We've got to get out of here.
Don't panic.
We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
So he finally talked, huh?
He says he left the bankbooks in a safe at the Muraki Inn in Tsukuji.
The Muraki Inn?
Damn!
He's a sly old fox!
Let's go have a look.
The inn will be a breeze.
The holly thorns cut me up bad while I dug for those pots stuffed with cash.
After the inn, it's straight to the papers.
Right.
And after the press conference, we all move into the pen.
That'll be the safest place.
I'm leaving the car.
Yoshiko.
What's going on?
Why are you sleeping here?
Tatsuo!
Nishi!
Where's Nishi?
Did you see Father?
Dad?
You didn't see him!
Did you shoot Nishi?
What?
Are you still half asleep?
I just got these.
So you weren't out looking for Nishi?
If I knew where that jerk was, I'd beat the crap out of him.
Why would Father lie to me?
What did Dad do?
Tell me!
Tatsuo, what are you thinking?
What do you think has happened?
We'll know when we get there.
I'm so frightened.
I want to trust Father.
So do I.
It was you, wasn't it?
You told them where Nishi was.
Congratulations.
Thanks to you, Nishi's been murdered.
Don't blame her.
Our father tricked her into telling.
Tricked her, did he?
Now all of Japan can be tricked the same way.
You must've seen it on your way here - that car flattened into scrap by a freight train.
Nishi was in that car!
You don't believe me?
I'll show you, then.
I'll show you what they did to him.
Look.
The signs of his last stand against them!
There's more.
Take a close look.
That bottle of alcohol and the broken syringe.
I think -
No, I'm positive.
Nishi -
They pinned him down.
Then... they shot him full of grain alcohol.
Then they dumped him in the car I'd left as a precaution and aimed him, unconscious, toward the tracks.
Drunk driving.
His sense of justice and all his hard work will be consigned to oblivion and his name dragged in the mud!
Yoshiko!
You're Tatsuo... right?
I'm Itakura.
Actually, my real name's Nishi.
But now I can't ever go back to being myself.
Listen to me.
The car Nishi died in was mine.
It was registered to Nishi.
So Nishi died in Nishi's car.
I'm Itakura now.
I can't testify to anything.
How could this happen?
Nishi was murdered last night - that much is certain.
Yet even though it's a fact... there's nothing I can do about it.
They killed Wada too.
Wada?
The assistant.
He was here last night, but now he's gone.
He was already thought to be dead.
Easy enough to get rid of him.
And Moriyama, who spilled his guts last night - they took him away too.
By now they've probably destroyed all material evidence.
I know everything.
It's horrifying that it's all so simple and yet so foul!
But I don't have a single shred of evidence.
There's nothing I can say, nothing I can do!
Goddamn it!
How can this be?
How can this be?
Apparently they found high levels of alcohol in his blood.
I find that impossible to believe.
Not Nishi.
As far as I'm concerned, he was irreplaceable.
And it's not nepotism that makes me laud his ability and effectiveness.
He was the perfect secretary.
And I've lost not only a model employee, but a son-in-law too.
I can only say that I'm stunned.
By the way, a man named Nishi called all the papers last night to announce a press conference.
That was done... at my own behest.
But given what's transpired, it can wait until another time.
Iwabuchi here.
What do you two want?
- I wish I had my rifle.
- What?
If I had my rifle, I could shoot you.
What is this nonsense?
Look at Yoshiko.
When you killed Nishi, you killed her too.
- Yoshiko.
- Stay back!
She's no longer your daughter, and I'm no longer your son.
We never want to see your face again.
That's all I came to say.
Tatsuo!
Yoshiko!
Yes, Iwabuchi speaking.
Please forgive the interruption.
Everything's been laid to rest.
I'm sorry for all the concern I caused you.
And with respect to my own position,
I believe I should resign for the good of Public Corp.
What?
Go abroad temporarily?
Yes, yes.
That's actually exactly what I had in mind.
I do hope you'll consider my future upon my return.
Good night, then.
Oh, my mistake.
I didn't sleep at all last night and seem to have mistaken night for day.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

NISHI AND IWABUCHI WEDDING PARTY
The ceremony is almost over.
This way, please.
- Have the Dairyu executives arrived?
- Yes.
- Where?
- In the hall?
Over there, in the reception area.
In front of the screen, by the pine tree.
- We want to see them immediately.
- Just for a minute.
So we don't disturb the banquet.
Excuse me.
Please make way for the bride and groom.
- The banquet's about to begin.
- Quick!
A police detective!
What's all this about?
Why cover the wedding of the daughter of Public Corporation's vice president?
- Don't play dumb.
They're both here.
- Who is?
You searched Dairyu and nabbed their accountant.
- Is the president or director next?
- Or both?
Excuse me.
Get a shot of them busting him.
Wada, get back to your seat.
I can't run the party without you.
Sir... the party program is outlined here.
- Who is that?
- Someone from Dairyu?
No, he's with Public Corp.
That's Wada, assistant chief of contracts.
That's Wada, right?
Hello.
News desk?
Here's a twist:
An arrest in Public Corp. 's contracts division.
The Public Corporation for Land Development.
That's right:
Assistant chief of contracts at Public Corp.
This is bigger than just embezzlement at Dairyu Construction.
It's obviously a kickback scheme between Dairyu and Public Corp.
Yes, I'll stay on the story.
Now that the ceremony is duly completed, we will commence the wedding feast.
I, Shirai, chief of contracts for Public Corporation, hereby undertake to serve, however poorly, as master of ceremonies.
First, our president, Arimura, who acted as matchmaker, will present the bride and groom.
Please allow me to present the couple.
The bridegroom, Koichi Nishi, who stands here beside me, hardly needs me to enumerate the skills he has displayed as Vice President Iwabuchi's secretary.
He only became secretary after his engagement.
I just heard that at the reception desk.
Nishi, who lost his family to the war...
What did this Nishi do before?
Unclear.
He's a pal of Iwabuchi's son.
What's the son do?
Nothing.
The infamous prodigal son.
He's the one who shocked everyone by catching the bride before she fell.
Nishi's future prospects glow brightly indeed.
As for his lovely bride, Yoshiko, she is a talented alumna of Keitoku Girls School and is not only exquisite, but also a rare paragon of unsullied innocence.
There's a senryu verse that goes:
"The bride is beautiful - that is, with dowry in hand. "
Don't be so cruel.
The groom is the cruel one.
He only married her to guarantee his own success.
On this most auspicious of days...
Auspicious indeed!
- And him?
- Moriyama, top administrator.
As great as the joy of both families must already be, we, the employees of Public Corporation, extend to them our most sincere congratulations.
For it is now three years since our corporation first...
Who's that?
Iwabuchi, vice president.
An assistant chief in contracts, his boss, the administrator, and the vice president.
It all adds up.
Iwabuchi-san, the new father-in-law...
Wait.
It's all coming back now.
Five years ago, that illegal bid on government construction.
An assistant, Furuya, jumped from a seventh-story window, but they covered it up.
Back then, Iwabuchi was division head, with Moriyama and Shirai under him.
The "Clean-Up Trio" of graft.
Then they all landed equivalent positions at Public Corp...
Nice little racket they've got going.
Now Moriyama-san will propose a toast to the newlyweds.
I'm actually among you today to stand in for the groom's father.
Someone more appropriate should propose the toast.
Enough formalities.
Get on with your toast.
Yes.
Hardly the time for him to be making a toast.
If it's not too presumptuous,
I'll toast to the bride and groom's future.
Cheers!
- Congratulations.
Another arrest?
Hey, he's with Dairyu Construction.
Did the police let him go?
Now let's take congratulations from our assembled guests.
First, Hatano-san, president of Dairyu Construction.
As you've been told,
I am Hatano of Dairyu Construction.
Today we sit among distinguished guests from political, government and business circles.
I am insignificant in comparison.
To be accorded the unexpected honor of speaking first leaves me dumbfounded.
He's really sweating his way through this one.
As for our relationship with Public Corporation,
Public found our fair and upright approach to business compatible with their own founding principles.
We've set aside profits in the interest of long-term goals and cooperated to achieve our present success.
The thing is, what I'd most like to say is
I have no personal ties to Public Corp.
Some toast.
Like he's pleading his case to the prosecutor.
It's difficult to find the right words, but I offer my most sincere congratulations.
May the bride and groom forge a strong marital bond and find great happiness together.
These are my congratulations, brief though they may be.
Next, the bridegroom's friend will speak on behalf of his circle.
He is also the bride's brother.
Tatsuo Iwabuchi will now offer congratulatory remarks.
Traditionally, in making a wedding toast, we stick to the same old sugarcoated clichés.
Frankly, my father isn't crazy about aspects of Nishi's past outlined in a detective agency's report.
But then it's not my father who's getting married.
My father has to accept that Yoshiko's in love with him.
Fact is, I love Nishi too.
We became friends a year and a half ago when I bought a used sports car from his tiny car dealership.
Since then, I've learned that Nishi has a rare sense of justice.
Rumors are flying about this wedding, about Nishi using my sister's disability to boost himself up the corporate ladder.
But I swear it can't be true.
I'm firmly convinced of that.
Hey, Nishi.
I'm counting on you to look after my sister.
She's had a tough life.
I may be a mess, but I'd do anything to protect her.
Listen, Nishi.
If you make my sister unhappy,
I swear I'll kill you!
A bit unconventional perhaps, but a great speech, brimming with passion.
Now it's time for the bride and groom to cut the wedding cake.
Yet another cake.
That's a strange one.
Must be a business gift.
Hey, looks like that ministry building.
Look, there's a rose on the seventh floor.
That's the window that guy jumped from.
What is it, Shirai?
Get on with it!
Yes... yes.
Allow me to replace that.
Helluva wedding.
Truly bizarre.
Best one-act I've ever seen.
One-act?
This is just the prelude.

EXECS' RELEASE PENDING - PROSECUTOR RUNNING OUT OF TIME
Wada-san, who on earth have you been protecting with your three weeks of silence?
You work for Public Corporation.
Like any government official, you have a duty to serve the public interest.
The 12 billion you guys gave Dairyu for construction costs were taxes the public paid with their sweat and blood.
Legitimate expenses are one thing.
But there's no question that the bidding was rigged.
All the other bids came in between 8.5 and nine billion.
Only Dairyu's 12-billion bid matched what Public Corp. Had estimated.
It fit like a glove.
Three billion higher than the others.
On top of that, you required all the bidders to submit complete itemized budgets immediately.
If they couldn't, you rejected them as unprofessional.
You handed that job to Dairyu on a silver platter.
This is an outrage!
A reckless waste of the public's hard-earned money!
You owe it to the public to reveal everything you know.
You're in charge of Public Corp. 's contracts.
No bidding scheme could have proceeded without your participation.
You're an expert in budgeting.
Bidders want that information badly.
I'll make an educated guess and say the idea to demand itemized budgets from Dairyu's competitors could only have come from an old business hand like you.
We're both a bit tired.
By the way, don't you live over in Zoshigaya?
I ran across this.
A receipt from the Hatsufune Restaurant's regular taxi company.
Of course the date, destination and time are all here.
"October 7, from Hatsufune to Zoshigaya. "
And another fare on the same date to Kamimachi.
Isn't that where your boss lives?
Then, on the same day, a fare to Nishiogikubo.
That's Moriyama's neighborhood, isn't it?
And this one to Shibuya, where Vice President Iwabuchi lives.
Wada-san, what am I to make of all this?
Hatsufune's books indicate Dairyu covered it all.
Sticking with your silence?
Look at this stack of receipts from other days.
PROSECUTOR NONAKA
Yes?
Special delivery.
Anonymous.
Something else from our informer.
"Look at taxi receipts from Hatsufune's regular company. "
Incredible.
One step behind us, but right on track.
Who could it be?
The tips are always right on target.
Most informers are rivals using slander for revenge.
This seems different.
Maybe it's from the same person the reporters mentioned who pulled off that wedding cake stunt.
No clue who sent that cake, right?
No, all we've got is the name of the bakery, an order describing the design, its destination, the date, and the alarming amount of cash delivered to pay for it.
Come in.
Still nothing?
He seemed like the perfect way to get to the Iwabuchi-Moriyama-Shirai clique.
How about Miura?
What'll we do?
We can't keep holding them.
We'll let Wada go.
And Miura?
Switch his charge to embezzlement and squeeze him harder.
We've discovered 23 million in undocumented payments on Dairyu's books.
Miura in accounting can't explain them.
Clear grounds for embezzlement charges.
If they were bribes, he could claim they were development costs and eventually return to the business.
But if he lined his own pockets with company funds, he'll never work again.
If we charge him with embezzlement, he'll talk.
So release him and then -
Releasing him and arresting him again is a dirty trick, but his tactics are even dirtier.
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER
That must have been an ordeal.
Miura-san, another warrant for you.
I'm his lawyer.
Embezzlement?
Before I came to meet you, the president, the other top executives, and I anticipated this very eventuality.
The president said that if it were to happen,
I should give you the following message.
He was quite adamant about it.
He said, "I know you'll see this through to the bitter end. "
Stop!
Prosecutor, any comment on Miura's suicide?
Your statement was short on detail.
- Did Miura really kill himself?
- He did.
Prosecutor, isn't this an advance in the art of murder?
That message the president sent with his lawyer right before Miura's suicide -
"I know you'll see this through to the bitter end" - might as well have been a bullet from a high-powered rifle.
This was, in fact, an assassination.
This was - in fact - nothing but a suicide.
Just a minute.
Aren't you concerned Wada will be next?
After his release, Wada met with Moriyama and Shirai.
He has yet to return home.
Can you confirm that he's safe?
Any word of his whereabouts?
We're conducting a thorough investigation.
IN CONFERENCE
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
SITE THREE
Forgive me.
I'll do it right now.
You've become a real lapdog, haven't you?
You'd kill yourself just because Moriyama and Shirai told you to.
Those masters you so loyally serve are celebrating even now.
To Iwabuchi, Moriyama and Shirai, you're just a nuisance, a walking liability they want to be rid of.
But listen to me:
Cattle and swine die kinder deaths!
I don't understand.
How can you say such things when you're -
When I'm Iwabuchi's son-in-law?
What'll it be?
You wanna die?
WADA OF PUBLIC CORPORATION COMMITS SUICIDE
DO SUICIDES PROVE CORRUPTION?
A SECOND VICTIM, FAST ON MIURA'S HEELS
UNDERLINGS SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO CONTAIN SCANDAL
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
What are your thoughts on Wada's suicide?
I grieve for him deeply.
Is that all?
First we had Miura's suicide, followed by Wada's.
Fairly convenient developments for Dairyu and Public Corporation.
What does that mean?
This way the bribery investigation goes up in smoke, just like five years ago with the ministry building contract.
Don't let your imagination run away with you, my friend.
Your statements are groundless.
You think so?
The public isn't so sure.
They wonder if those two really had to die.
You're barking up the wrong tree... with these questions.
Miura killed himself after three weeks of interrogation when they released him, only to serve him with another warrant.
As for Wada,
I gather he was an earnest man with a meek personality.
An innocent man accused of dishonesty, on the verge of a breakdown when he was released.
What drove these two men to their deaths?
Why don't you ask the prosecutor's office for the truth?
N. I. AUTO SALES AND SERVICE
Yes, a Chrysler.
No, a New Yorker won't do.
Has to be an Imperial.
Black exterior, gray interior.
Got that?
You should eat something.
What kind of person is Nishi?
Given his relationship to the vice president, I just don't -
Why did he save me?
I mean, what did he accomplish?
Please tell me.
Just what kind of person is he?
And what kind of person are you?
What's your relationship to him?
My relationship with Nishi?
It's very complex and mysterious.
Time to go.
- Where?
- Your funeral.
I just dropped off an offering on behalf of Iwabuchi and the firm.
They've put on quite a show.
A five-tier altar, three priests, and two huge wreaths courtesy of Public Corp.
A beautiful funeral.
I knew it.
And here you are -
Dairyu would've liked to send flowers in celebration, but that would've been a bit obvious.
Why are you doing this to me?
This is sheer torment.
I'd rather be dead.
Please, let me die.
I have to die.
Wasting this fine funeral -
Calm down, now.
There's something I want you to hear.
You've been to Noir, right?
The bar run by Moriyama's mistress?
This is Moriyama and Shirai talking there last night.
What, you come to this kind of place?
And so soon after getting married?
You've caught me red-handed.
I'm ready for a dance.
Now, now.
No need to rush off.
That's when I placed a briefcase with this tape recorder inside it under their table.
I'll play their conversation for you after they arrive for the funeral.
Public Corp. 's official car.
Chief Shirai!
Moriyama!
Man, oh, man, what a relief.
You were born with a gift for persuasion.
That sounds awful.
Look who's talking.
You left him no choice but suicide.
Cut it out.
No need to spell it out like that.
Let's drink and enjoy ourselves tonight.
Still, it all leaves a bad taste in my mouth somehow.
Get yourself a young girl, the best remedy for a day like today.
Wada, still ready to die for them and let them go scot-free?
Don't you want revenge?
- Revenge?
- That's right.
You and me together.
Drinking so early?
Did you see the papers?
Makes me feel like crap.
A drunk needs no excuse to drink.
I wish I had your blind faith in Dad.
What the papers hint at can't be true.
Our father couldn't possibly -
He's been a good father to you.
Loved you enough for two after Mom died.
Is he a bad father to you?
No, he's a good father to me too, which is why this drives me so crazy.
Let's drop the subject.
A baby like you can only trust blindly.
I'm not a baby.
Oh, excuse me.
Lady of the house, is it?
What's wrong?
Are you happy?
Does Nishi...
love you?
You sure?
Yes.
Why do you ask?
If he loves you, that's all that matters.
The prosecution seems to have let up, and the matter's closed.
I'm sorry for allowing this to cause you such concern.
Who?
The president?
I'll give the old man a vague report at some point.
No doubt he'll hold forth about earnest principles and such.
I trust you'll be able to handle him.
Yes, thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Isn't it time you took off that mourning band?
And you should knock before entering, even if you are a member of the family.
That's all for today.
Make a left here.
MITSUl STORAGE
It's ready, sir.
Follow me.
- This is all very mysterious.
- Yes, I -
Just who do you think stole that five million yen in cash from the safe-deposit box in the vault?
When I found that postcard in the box,
I assumed it was probably the same person who sent that cake to the wedding banquet.
That cake had to be from one of the losing bidders.
But how could they get to the vault?
Only you and Wada knew of it.
That's just it.
We set up two - no, three levels of security to protect that deposit box.
And those were?
The key and seal to enter the vault are in a suitcase in storage.
But you need my regular office seal to access the storage room.
And here's the key to the suitcase.
I keep them both in my unlocked desk drawer.
It seemed safer than acting as if I had something to hide.
The seal and key are useless anyway unless you know about the suitcase in storage.
An ingenious plan.
Thank you.
The thing is, the complexity of the plan only implicates you more deeply.
Only you and Wada knew the whole setup.
Take away Wada and that leaves you.
No wonder Moriyama is suspicious of you.
But I
- I would never -
Calm down.
But -
By the way, do you still have the key and seal for the deposit box?
Yes.
Hand them over.
It's hardly a huge sum, but Moriyama should still investigate.
What's wrong?
Don't you have them?
No, it's just -
I thought - In my briefcase -
In your secretary's office.
Nishi speaking.
- Bring in Shirai's briefcase.
- No, I'll get it myself.
Thank you.
Just what are you doing?
Aren't the key and seal in your briefcase either?
No, it's not that.
Then show them to me.
Why won't you open it?
Seems there's something in there you don't want me to see.
Let's have a look.
I said open it!
I have no idea... how that got in my briefcase.
That's enough.
Come with me.
I don't have any -
Just follow me!
Sir, we're in Kamimachi now.
Which house is yours?
Sir?
Sir, this is Kamimachi Block 2.
Sir. that's 540 yen.
Your change.
Wada!
You expect me to believe that Wada's alive and that he took the money?
Ridiculous!
Don't say that.
It's true.
I saw him with my own eyes.
Enough of your excuses.
Wada!
Our work is done for tonight.
Isn't it fun playing a ghost?
What's wrong?
You saw him, didn't you?
Shirai's face.
Why should you care?
Aren't you happy to see him suffer?
What's the matter?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, it's Shirai-san.
See that he gets home.
I swear, I saw Wada with my own eyes.
I swear it.
Enough!
I wonder if Father's all right.
Forget Dad.
Worry about your husband.
I don't know what Nishi's up to.
He's out late every night.
He came home early last night.
Oh, you're home.
It's late.
Had to go out with the boys.
Did you go to Noir?
Yeah, something like that.
I was there all evening.
Listen, Nishi.
Yoshiko, please get some more ice.
- You're going to drink more?
I'll start a new round with Nishi.
Bring me that ice.
Hey.
Why do you two sleep in separate rooms?
The project I'm working on keeps me out till all hours.
I'd hate to wake her in the middle of the night.
What the hell are you up to?
The stakes must be awfully high.
It's written all over your face.
I know well enough that being Dad's secretary involves you in risky situations.
But listen, Nishi.
Don't risk your neck for him.
If only for Yoshiko's sake.
She's -
I feel such pity for her.
And I have only my own stupidity to blame.
When she was just this small,
I took a fall on my bike with her on the back.
It's my fault she's lame, Nishi.
She has to be happy.
I have to help her.
I'm begging you.
You've got to make her happy.
Please.
Yoshiko!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
- No, I'm sorry.
I'm fine.
Thank goodness.
Good night!
Good night.
So Shirai even hounded you at home?
Do you think my husband is still alive?
I'm terribly sorry.
I think you should give up any such hope.
But Shirai-san says he's definitely seen him.
He's hallucinating.
Your husband's death came as a great shock to him.
He's suffered a nervous breakdown.
Where's Chief Moriyama?
Shirai-san, where's Chief Moriyama?
He's in the conference room.
Vice President Iwabuchi wishes to see him.
Shirai?
You mean, he even went to you?
But I just can't -
Iwabuchi explained what happened.
But there's no reason for Shirai to swipe such a measly sum.
We've paid you more than amply.
Shirai needs a cut too.
This is nonsense!
Of course he's been rewarded handsomely.
Isn't that right?
- Yes.
A man with a full stomach doesn't bother with snacks.
We've got to stick together.
Don't go too rough on Shirai.
Let me handle him.
You can't meddle with our affairs at Public Corp.
But what if he gets desperate?
He might start blabbing to the prosecutor.
Then you're done for.
That's your choice, but don't drag us down with you.
This whole bidding scheme was your idea.
You asked us to estimate a nine-billion job at 12 billion and kick back the three billion to you.
We didn't like the idea one bit, but we like doing business with you, so we came on board.
But now you'd risk all our necks for a measly five million.
We've had enough.
You say three billion, but you've only kicked back half.
Ten percent is a standard kickback.
1.5 on 12 billion's plenty.
- But our deal was -
- Listen, Iwabuchi.
You want a political career.
You're eyeing a ministry seat.
If you get it, we'll reconsider our position.
I think we've made ourselves absolutely clear.
Let's leave the Shirai problem in Iwabuchi-san's hands.
Excuse us.
- Thank you.
Let's go.
They're rather full of themselves, I have to say.
You're one to talk.
Are you sure you've given Shirai his share?
Why, I would never -
Forget it.
Just do something about him.
- Meaning?
- Calm him down somehow.
Take him out to dinner and apologize.
Apologize?
That's what it means to be on top!
He hardly looks the part of a bad guy.
These are just about done.
It's too hot.
How's that?
Moriyama-san's on the phone.
I'll take it.
How are Nishi's performance evaluations?
Just about perfect.
But he never seems to relax and open up.
Yoshiko will loosen him up a bit, right?
By the way, Father,
I have a request.
- I hope it isn't money.
- No, it's not that.
Give up your political ambitions and retire as soon as you're a grandfather.
You're the one who'd suffer, forced to give up all your luxuries.
In that case, I'll get a job.
I'll believe that when I see it.
Moriyama-san wishes to speak to you directly.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
What?
You leave me no choice.
I'll be there.
Where are you?
What?
Suminoya?
Are you crazy?
Why in the world did you take him there?
Are you going out?
Shall I join you?
- No.
Where's Father?
He's gone out.
I'll be going out after dinner too.
Thank you for coming.
We'll call you if we need you.
I think it's what they call paranoia.
What's wrong, Shirai?
Why don't you join us?
Come, now.
Do as our vice president says.
Let's have a toast.
Everything's exactly the same.
Just like it was... five years ago.
That night Furuya sat there, you were there, and I was there.
The conversation started the same way.
"Let's have a toast. "
Don't make me laugh!
You can't talk me into jumping out a window, the way you did with Furuya.
Try that with me... and I'll spill the whole story.
Shirai, calm down now.
We've invited you here because our relationship with you has been under some strain and we'd like to improve it.
In a word, we're here out of concern for your state of mind.
The exact same words.
That's exactly how you backed Furuya into a corner.
Wada too.
You know where Shirai lives?
Draw me a map.
You know the Kamimachi bus stop?
The bus stop is here.
You pass the next street and turn at the second one.
Shirai's house is here.
Is it a quiet street?
Yes, especially at night.
It's 8:30 now.
See him home at 11:00 and drop him off at this corner.
Two and a half hours is plenty of time.
Plenty of time for what?
Do I need to spell it out?
Wada!
You Shirai?
Answer me.
You're Shirai, right?
Get in.
Where are you taking me?
Why have you brought me here?
I want to see you die here.
I knew it.
You're doing this for the vice president.
You're wrong.
Iwabuchi hired a killer.
But you don't deserve the favor of an assassin's bullet.
Recognize that window?
- Furuya!
- That's right.
Look at the hideous way he died:
His neck broken, lying in a pool of his own blood.
The man who jumped from that window five years ago was my father!
You find that shocking?
I'm Furuya's son.
That's a lie.
He had no children.
I was illegitimate.
My father hid his relationship with my mother.
I can't believe it.
You're the vice president's -
It wasn't easy leaping into a snake pit like this.
The real Koichi Nishi is elsewhere.
He and I exchanged identities.
For five years now,
I've lived only to avenge my father's death.
I carry this picture with me always.
The poor man.
The law couldn't bring you to justice, but I'll do it with my own bare hands.
I'll start by making you break your own damned neck.
Moriyama and I were just following Iwabuchi's orders -
You forced my father to kill himself.
No, I just -
The truth!
By threats or pleas you convinced him to kill himself, didn't you?
- No.
- Liar!
I arranged that cake for my own wedding.
Your panic when it appeared confirmed everything.
Was that... what you intended... for me too?
Forgive me!
Time to jump and break your neck.
This drink's spiked with poison.
You hardly deserve the luxury, but it'll be quick.
What'll it be?
Jump out the window?
Or swallow this, sitting in the very chair my father sat in?
Wada, you make him drink it.
You've certainly earned the right.
Please forgive him.
He has a wife and children too.
And what about you?
What about your family?
No, this is enough.
I forgive him.
Forgive?
How dare you!
Who gave you the right to forgive him?
You were in on their crooked schemes.
So was my father.
They tamed my father and you with scraps from their table and offered you up as scapegoats, yet you can't hate them.
This is the only message scum like them understand.
Even now they sleep soundly, grins on their faces.
I won't stand for it!
I can never hate them enough!
How can you be so brutal?
It's just whiskey.
The shock was too much for him.
He's lost his mind.
I had other plans for him, but this'll do.
They'll find him this way in the morning, here on the seventh floor.
The papers will have a field day.
Watch Iwabuchi and Moriyama's blood pressure spike.
Wada, have a drink.
Let's celebrate.
Not a single line.
They hushed it up.
That government office tipped off Iwabuchi this morning.
Public Corp. 's in bed with them too.
The bastards.
And to top it all off, Moriyama and I had to go get Shirai.
We took him to an insane asylum.
Acute schizophrenia triggered by a profound shock.
That was his diagnosis.
Worst of all, he keeps apologizing to Furuya.
Furuya?
"Furuya, forgive me," over and over.
It just doesn't make any sense.
What was Shirai doing in that seventh-floor office?
The door was locked from the outside.
He'd never go there voluntarily.
Then who was it?
Sir... maybe Shirai didn't steal anything from the vault.
Maybe it was that same unknown person.
Why?
When you think about it, there's a common thread running through these strange events.
The cake at the wedding, the postcard inside the box, the office where Shirai was found and his inexplicable behavior.
They're all tied to Furuya, which means that someone is doing these things in retaliation for Furuya's death.
That's my conclusion.
It makes sense in theory, but who would do that for Furuya?
That's just it.
I believe his widow was the only one to survive him.
Still, under the circumstances, I'd better double-check on that.
I'm too soft.
I should have thrown Shirai out that window.
If I had, the papers would be all over Iwabuchi and Moriyama by now.
I guess I don't hate them enough.
Something's not quite right about you.
You're going against your nature.
It's not easy hating evil.
You have to stoke your own fury until you become evil yourself.
There's nothing wrong with hating evil, but you're sacrificing innocent bystanders.
Yoshiko-san, for example.
You married her as a weapon.
What if she finds out your real motive?
Shut up!
What are you shouting about?
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with Iwabuchi's daughter.
Hit the nail on the head, huh?
Unfortunately.
Nothing unfortunate about it.
It's an excellent development.
She may be your enemy's daughter, but if you're in love, then love her.
It's childish to let that get you all knotted up.
So the prosecutor's fallen in love with the defendant's daughter.
Fine.
Just don't get hung up on it.
On our wedding night -
On our wedding night, we -
Well, given Yoshiko's condition, we skipped the normal honeymoon and spent the night at Iwabuchi's house.
I was touched by how she waited so innocently in our bedroom.
She lay there, rigid as a doll... her face pale.
Her eyes were closed tight, and she was trembling.
I realized I couldn't take advantage of this girl.
Ever since -
You asshole!
That's worse than torturing her.
Hold on a minute.
I was wrong.
I've been torn in two ever since.
I've even had second thoughts.
So I've forced my own anger, becoming more brutal than I needed to.
I want vengeance for my father, but that's not all.
I want those villains brought to justice for the sake of all the helpless people who don't even know they've been had.
Remember how driven I was when I asked you to exchange identities?
Where's all that gone?
I make myself sick.
If you think you've gone wrong, start over.
I don't need this anymore.
That's the spirit.
So now what?
It'd be great to blast apart Moriyama, Iwabuchi and the head honcho himself in one fell swoop.
I'll use myself for dynamite.
The fact Iwabuchi sent me to clean up after Shirai proves he's begun to really trust me.
If I sit tight and play my cards right, I'll get to the bottom of their schemes.
And then - bang!
In the meantime, you might as well love that bride of yours.
Make tonight your real honeymoon.
Buy her a bouquet on me.
I must tell you,
Furuya has been constantly in my thoughts lately.
And, of course, I've been worried about you.
Thank you so much.
I manage to get along somehow.
But it can't be easy, a single woman, managing these apartments by yourself.
I don't remember Furuya having any relatives other than yourself.
The truth is, I've never told you this before, but my husband did have a child who never lived with us.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to pry in any way.
Not at all.
Being alone like this at my age,
I long to meet him.
I'd even like him to live with me if he would.
It was a boy.
Come to think of it, he must be a man by now.
That part of my husband's life happened long before we got married.
And where are the woman and her son now?
If only I knew.
In fact, I believe the mother passed away, so the son must be all alone in the world.
Truly all alone.
Illegitimate - is that the word?
Couldn't even use my husband's name.
I hate to impose on your kindness by asking this, but couldn't you somehow find the boy?
It would make me - No, it would make Furuya so happy.
What was the woman's name?
Itakura.
I believe she went by Itakura.
Do you have anything else to go on?
That's absolutely everything I know.
I hated her so much, I couldn't stand to know anything about her.
I never dreamed that time would change my feelings this way.
Don't you even have a picture of the boy?
You do?
These are pictures from Furuya's funeral, so maybe -
Yes, this one, just as the hearse was driving away.
This man is by himself, away from the mourners, standing behind that telephone pole.
That face.
It looks so sad.
No, anguished.
He must have been a relative.
Do you think just maybe he was Furuya's son?
I'd like a bouquet, please.
It's for a couple of newlyweds.
Where's Nishi?
Not home yet.
Cut it out, Father.
What do you mean?
Stop making Nishi do your dirty work.
- I don't understand.
- Don't play dumb.
He's out late every night.
Last night it was 2:00 a. m.
2:00 a.
M?
What the hell are you making him do?
- Imagine how Yoshiko feels.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
And that fuss this morning, sending him out with Moriyama before dawn.
That's strange.
What can Nishi be up to?
What is it?
- Moriyama-san is here.
- Send him in.
You mean to say Nishi is Furuya's son?
His real name's Itakura, but there's no doubt at all.
Wait a minute.
He was out last night until 2:00.
Just about the time Shirai was found on the seventh floor.
It all fits perfectly.
Furuya's son is using your daughter for revenge.
But his legal name is Nishi, not Itakura.
Itakura.
Welcome home.
Don't move, damn it!
Tatsuo, what's wrong?
Out of the way, Yoshiko.
He's using you.
You're just a pawn for his vengeance.
Stop!
You should've kept up the pretense.
We'd have handled it.
I intended to, but as I've explained -
How did you, of all people, accept such an absurd match for Yoshiko?
We conducted an investigation.
There was no cause for suspicion of any kind.
What did he used to do?
He had a used-car dealership.
A broker, huh?
What became of the dealership?
He sold it when he came to work for me.
That's the only thing we have to go on.
Moriyama's already checking on it.
Hello.
What is it?
It's Nishi.
Iwabuchi here.
What did he have to say?
- He's got Moriyama.
- What?
And Wada's still alive.
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
Quit your whining.
You only have yourself to blame.
If you hadn't exposed my identity, I'd never have treated you like this.
You just stumbled into our hands at a critical moment.
- Kidnapping is a serious crime.
- That's right.
It's pointless trying to use the law against evil people.
I've racked up plenty of crimes.
Identity fraud, matrimonial fraud, unlawful detention.
Illegal entry, blackmail, kidnapping.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
I can turn myself in with my head held high.
Turn yourself in?
I'll lay it all out for you.
After you've spilled the beans, I'll call a press conference.
A press conference?
I'll start by introducing Wada.
"Wada of Public Corp. Found alive. "
Good headline.
Next I'll introduce myself.
"Iwabuchi's son-in-law and secretary - whose own father was murdered five years ago - uncovers massive corruption at the Public Corp. For Land Development. "
And finally, you.
"Moriyama corroborates evidence of corruption at Public Corp. "
Press coverage whips public opinion into a frenzy.
I turn myself in and cooperate with the authorities at my leisure from the comfort of my cell.
- And if I refuse to talk?
- I'll make you!
And I play rough!
A forced confession isn't binding.
Think I don't know that?
But if I've got material evidence, the prosecutor will accept it in the end.
Even Wada knows Shirai pocketed seven million.
You probably got twice that, at least 15.
Where's it all stashed?
In your position, it'd take 10 years of self-denial to set aside 15 million.
That sum alone is material evidence of graft.
And another thing.
The day after they searched Dairyu and arrested Wada, you came flying into Iwabuchi's office, your face all pale.
I could hear Iwabuchi raging at you, "Can't you even handle this?"
You came out of his office stuffing 10 bankbooks into your briefcase.
No doubt the kickbacks are divided among all those accounts.
If we could track those down, there'd be no better proof.
But Shirai just spilled the beans.
Liar.
I'm the only one -
No one else knows?
Not even Iwabuchi?
Why, thank you.
Now we've got all our ducks in a nice neat row.
So of course Iwabuchi doesn't know where you stashed your 15-odd million.
In other words, as long as we've got you,
Iwabuchi can't touch that valuable evidence.
So we'll just sit back and wait until Moriyama here decides to come clean.
Stop, you sons of bitches!
Hey, open up!
Open up!
Remember how shocked we were when we crawled out after the carpet-bombing?
The factory had been destroyed.
We were surrounded by a sea of flames.
I still have nightmares about that hellish scene.
Me too.
But time sure flies.
It's already been 15 years since they yanked us out of high school to man that factory.
Look at that smokestack.
You and I slugged it out for real over there.
You were an arrogant asshole.
So were you.
- But once we started fighting -
- I wasn't such an asshole after all?
Remember our bicycle cart without even a tire left?
Sure I do.
That cart was the only thing that kept us fed after the war.
Wada, we used to haul industrial oil out of here in that cart to sell to the fancy villas.
It was gone in seconds.
We managed to make that money grow.
Provisions brokers, textile brokers, steel brokers.
With my family up north wiped out in a naval bombardment and this guy a bastard child, we made a perfect team.
Although we never saw eye to eye on going to college.
But your degree sure came in handy.
Thanks to your name and history,
I managed to marry Iwabuchi's daughter.
This place brings back memories!
It was a mistake for him to fall in love with her.
You really think so?
From her point of view, if she knew he really loved her, that she wasn't just being used, that would at least be some consolation.
I met the young lady twice while planning the wedding.
She's a genuinely sweet person.
When I think of her agony,
I wish a peaceful resolution were possible.
Unfortunately there just isn't any way.
Forget the daughter.
That man's evil.
If we hesitate, we're finished!
Are you trying to starve me?
Of course not.
We figured you'd be too anxious to have an appetite.
Cut the crap!
You've starved me for two whole days.
- Would you eat?
- Of course.
We haven't got much to offer.
You like ham and eggs on toast?
Anything!
Ham and eggs on toast will run you a cool 15 million.
Fifteen million?
Surely you're not shocked?
"Always get a kickback. " That's your policy, isn't it?
Your share of the Dairyu kickbacks came to 15 million.
Until you tell us where it's stashed, no ham and eggs.
What's wrong?
I'm terrified.
If you keep this up, where will it lead?
You're up against a terrifying system that will never yield.
Having worked inside it for 25 years, I know that in my guts.
Everyone feels that way and gives up.
That's how they get away with it.
Open up!
Hey, open the door!
Changed your mind?
Like hell!
I'll die before I tell you anything!
Then there's no point.
Seaweed canisters?
1,650 ten-thousand yen notes - would that be about this high?
Wrapped in plastic, sealed with tape, stuffed in ceramic pots.
You greedy old codger.
Buried in the east corner of the yard, under the holly tree.
You positive?
Under the holly tree?
Sounds like a fairy tale.
By the way, do you have a dog?
We'll go check it out tonight.
What's the big idea, leaving me locked up in here?
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
The bankbooks.
What became of those?
You'll stay until you tell us.
- That's absurd!
I have no idea!
Nothing like a full belly.
Will there be any special requests for room service next time?
Goddamn you!
No matter how hard you lean on him, he'll never talk.
You don't understand bureaucrats.
A good official never implicates a superior, no matter what the cost.
How touching.
So corruption continues unchecked, and the fat cats brazenly steal public funds.
There's happily ever after for you.
Please don't be sarcastic.
It's hard on me too.
I'm losing my grip.
Who am I?
Am I alive or dead?
At least you've got plans for the future.
- And you don't?
- I don't know anymore.
I know I'd like to see my wife and daughter, but I can't.
Sure you can.
Get Moriyama to come clean and you and I can turn ourselves in.
But who knows what'll happen if I do?
I can't do it.
Unmasking a superior - it's impossible.
And what about Yoshiko-san?
She'll never understand.
If you expose her father, she'll never forgive you.
Enough, you old fool!
You can't get to Nishi with your sob stories.
He's not a petty bureaucrat like you.
He's gone.
Time to move out.
- Move out?
- Wada ran away.
Why would he do that?
He's no longer human, a functionary.
An alien creature molded by bureaucracy.
After everything he's been through, he's still loyal.
See that?
Serves you right!
Quiet!
The exertion will only make you hungry!
Someone's coming!
You got your pistol?
No, I left it at Iwabuchi's.
Hey, I'm in here!
You realize what a serious risk you just took?
I felt sorry for Nishi-san and Yoshiko-san.
Liar!
Bringing in the woman to sweet-talk him - a low tactic.
How'd you contact her?
By phone.
I coaxed her out, then brought her here by cab.
- You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes, of course.
Wada, make another phone call.
This time go straight to Iwabuchi.
I'll give you five - no, ten million.
And that's not all.
I'll recommend you for Shirai's job and throw in a promotion too.
I... heard about everything from Wada-san.
I'm... so very happy.
Happier than you can imagine.
But my father -
Is he really such a bad person?
Please, tell me the truth.
Tatsuo sometimes says the same thing.
Is that really what Father is like?
So it's true, then.
But he's always been a wonderful father to me.
Yoshiko!
Could you forgive my father if I begged you to?
No, I'm sorry.
That's what Wada-san wanted me to say.
But I could never ask that of you.
When I think of your father, it's only natural that you hate mine.
But I can't hate him myself.
What are we going to do?
Life is so ironic.
I don't just mean our relationship.
My relationship with my father too.
Let me tell you the story of my father's life.
Even though he had my mother and me, he married someone his boss suggested in order to get ahead.
That's the kind of man he was.
I didn't know I was illegitimate until I applied to high school.
I always thought my father was dead.
When I found out that the man I'd known as my uncle was my father, my whole world went black.
I never wanted to see him again, so whenever he came to visit, I would run away.
After my mother's death, I wouldn't see him.
But then... five years ago...
I don't even know how he managed to find me, but he suddenly turned up at my place.
Later I realized he wanted to make peace with me before he died.
He kept apologizing, his eyes full of tears.
I didn't know why he'd come.
I lashed out at him and then stormed out.
The next day,
I read about his suicide in the paper.
Then an envelope arrived.
Inside was a bankbook in my name.
The account held 1.5 million yen.
A lot of money for someone in his position.
Probably kickbacks.
But now I'm overwhelmed by how much he cared for me.
The more I regret lashing out at him, the more his words and gestures I remember from my childhood seem like signs of his love for me.
My obsession with him after his death was as strong as my hatred for him while he was alive.
That's what's driven me to go this far.
I've used my inheritance to finance this scheme.
It was the only thing I could do with that money.
I'll go tell my father that he must make amends for all these sins.
I don't think he's capable of that.
Then what can I do?
Yoshiko.
If you really want your father to make amends, let me take care of it.
It may seem unbearable to allow me to expose his deeds, but it's the only way he'll ever make up for what he's done.
Yes.
As you say, right now my hands are tied.
Yes, I understand that perfectly.
In the worst case, I will take my own life.
I wouldn't think of dragging you into this.
What?
It was kind of you to have the drug delivered to me, even going to the trouble of indicating dosage.
I am much obliged.
The fact is, my nerves have been getting the better of me.
Tonight, thanks to your consideration,
I'll take a small dose and sleep peacefully.
Hello?
Welcome home.
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?
Yoshiko never goes anywhere.
Where was she?
I don't know.
When did she leave?
After she got a phone call just after noon.
Who was it?
I don't know.
The caller didn't give his name.
He simply asked to speak to your daughter.
And Tatsuo?
He woke up at 2:00 in an awful mood, took his gun and went out.
He was wearing hunting clothes.
That'll be all.
Where's Nishi?
You'd better tell me.
Tatsuo left with his rifle, swearing he'd get Nishi.
Yoshiko, where's Nishi?
Didn't you go see him?
I'm afraid Tatsuo followed you to track down Nishi.
If that's not it,
I don't know what to do next.
What on earth is Tatsuo planning?
This is just punishment for all the harm I've done.
I should have resolved long ago to turn myself in and make amends.
If I had, this never would have -
I can't bear to sit here like this.
Father, it's true.
I did go to see Nishi.
What?
Really?
There's hope, then.
Where is he?
I'll go with you.
No, leave this to me.
You can barely stand.
No, I'm going with you.
Have some of this wine.
Drink it all, quickly.
Wait here while I call for the car.
I need the car right away.
What's wrong?
You're in no condition to go out.
No, I'm -
Yoshiko, there's no time.
Leave this to me.
Where's Nishi?
Tell me now!
Where is he?
The ruins of that munitions factory... in Musashihara.
I put your bride in a taxi.
We've got to get out of here.
Don't panic.
We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
So he finally talked, huh?
He says he left the bankbooks in a safe at the Muraki Inn in Tsukuji.
The Muraki Inn?
Damn!
He's a sly old fox!
Let's go have a look.
The inn will be a breeze.
The holly thorns cut me up bad while I dug for those pots stuffed with cash.
After the inn, it's straight to the papers.
Right.
And after the press conference, we all move into the pen.
That'll be the safest place.
I'm leaving the car.
Yoshiko.
What's going on?
Why are you sleeping here?
Tatsuo!
Nishi!
Where's Nishi?
Did you see Father?
Dad?
You didn't see him!
Did you shoot Nishi?
What?
Are you still half asleep?
I just got these.
So you weren't out looking for Nishi?
If I knew where that jerk was, I'd beat the crap out of him.
Why would Father lie to me?
What did Dad do?
Tell me!
Tatsuo, what are you thinking?
What do you think has happened?
We'll know when we get there.
I'm so frightened.
I want to trust Father.
So do I.
It was you, wasn't it?
You told them where Nishi was.
Congratulations.
Thanks to you, Nishi's been murdered.
Don't blame her.
Our father tricked her into telling.
Tricked her, did he?
Now all of Japan can be tricked the same way.
You must've seen it on your way here - that car flattened into scrap by a freight train.
Nishi was in that car!
You don't believe me?
I'll show you, then.
I'll show you what they did to him.
Look.
The signs of his last stand against them!
There's more.
Take a close look.
That bottle of alcohol and the broken syringe.
I think -
No, I'm positive.
Nishi -
They pinned him down.
Then... they shot him full of grain alcohol.
Then they dumped him in the car I'd left as a precaution and aimed him, unconscious, toward the tracks.
Drunk driving.
His sense of justice and all his hard work will be consigned to oblivion and his name dragged in the mud!
Yoshiko!
You're Tatsuo... right?
I'm Itakura.
Actually, my real name's Nishi.
But now I can't ever go back to being myself.
Listen to me.
The car Nishi died in was mine.
It was registered to Nishi.
So Nishi died in Nishi's car.
I'm Itakura now.
I can't testify to anything.
How could this happen?
Nishi was murdered last night - that much is certain.
Yet even though it's a fact... there's nothing I can do about it.
They killed Wada too.
Wada?
The assistant.
He was here last night, but now he's gone.
He was already thought to be dead.
Easy enough to get rid of him.
And Moriyama, who spilled his guts last night - they took him away too.
By now they've probably destroyed all material evidence.
I know everything.
It's horrifying that it's all so simple and yet so foul!
But I don't have a single shred of evidence.
There's nothing I can say, nothing I can do!
Goddamn it!
How can this be?
How can this be?
Apparently they found high levels of alcohol in his blood.
I find that impossible to believe.
Not Nishi.
As far as I'm concerned, he was irreplaceable.
And it's not nepotism that makes me laud his ability and effectiveness.
He was the perfect secretary.
And I've lost not only a model employee, but a son-in-law too.
I can only say that I'm stunned.
By the way, a man named Nishi called all the papers last night to announce a press conference.
That was done... at my own behest.
But given what's transpired, it can wait until another time.
Iwabuchi here.
What do you two want?
- I wish I had my rifle.
- What?
If I had my rifle, I could shoot you.
What is this nonsense?
Look at Yoshiko.
When you killed Nishi, you killed her too.
- Yoshiko.
- Stay back!
She's no longer your daughter, and I'm no longer your son.
We never want to see your face again.
That's all I came to say.
Tatsuo!
Yoshiko!
Yes, Iwabuchi speaking.
Please forgive the interruption.
Everything's been laid to rest.
I'm sorry for all the concern I caused you.
And with respect to my own position,
I believe I should resign for the good of Public Corp.
What?
Go abroad temporarily?
Yes, yes.
That's actually exactly what I had in mind.
I do hope you'll consider my future upon my return.
Good night, then.
Oh, my mistake.
I didn't sleep at all last night and seem to have mistaken night for day.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
THE BAD SLEEP WELL

(male presenter, off) THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION
BEYOND THAT WHICH IS KNOWN TO MAN.
IT IS A DIMENSION AS VAST AS SPACE

HELLO, DAD.
HELLO, BABY.
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?
SHE'S OUT IN THE BACK TRYING TO URGE THE RADISHES OUT OF THE GROUND OR SOMETHING.
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
NOT BEFORE WE HAVE OUR DANCE.
SOME OTHER TIME, HONEY.
[music stops]
[sighs]
DAD?
WHAT, JODY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOTHING SERIOUS.
JUST FEELING MY YEARS, I GUESS.
YOU, MY DARLING, YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE AND YOUR MATURING WAYS,
YOU SUDDENLY REM IND ME THAT MY YOUTH IS UPSTAIRS IN THE ATTIC
SPREAD OUT OVER A FEW PHOTO ALBUMS.
IS THAT ALL?
IS THAT ALL?
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.
DAD?
DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR JOB?
IS THAT THE PROBLEM?
THE JOB.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A JOB.
OH, I MEAN JUST HAVING TO WORK ON THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU DO.
FEVER BOMBS AND HYDROGEN BOMBS AND GAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
NO, I'M JUST A COG IN A WHEEL, JODY.
I MEAN, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
IN ONE BOMB THERE ARE PERHAPS A THOUSAND PIECES,
AND EVERY PIECE REQUIRES A TEAM OF 50, 60, 70 PEOPLE.
LOOKING AT IT LIKE THAT, I'M NOT--
QUITE AS RESPONSIBLE AS IF I--
HELLO, DARLING.
EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO LATELY THEY'VE BEEN NOTICING IT.
NOTICING WHAT, JO?
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG.
THAT SOMETHING'S--
SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR.
THAT SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
AND EVERYBODY'S AFRAID.
EVERYONE, DAD, WHY?
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEMSELVES AFRAID.
THEY'RE AFRAID BECAUSE THEY SUBVERT EVERY GREAT THING EVER DISCOVERED.
EVERY FINE IDEA EVER THOUGHT, EVERY MARVELOUS INVENTION EVER CONCEIVED.
THEY SUBVERT IT, JODY.
THEY MAKE IT CROOKED AND DEVIOUS.
AND THEN TOO LATE,
FAR TOO LATE THEY ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHY.
AND THEN IT'S TOO LATE.
EVERYTHING IS TOO LATE!
INVITE JERRY RIDEN AND HIS WIFE OVER TONIGHT, WILL YOU, EVE?
WE'LL HAVE SOME CARDS OR SOMETHING.
ISN'T JERRY OUT OF TOWN?
ISN'T HE TESTING SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT UP NORTH?
NO, HE'S BACK.
HE CAME BACK THIS MORNING.
I TOLD HIM WE'D PHONE THEM.
YOU'LL BE THERE, JODY, WON'T YOU?
HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.
OH, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.
I'VE, UH, I'VE GOT A DATE.
MAYBE I COULD GET IN A LITTLE EARLY.
BREAK IT, WILL YOU, JODY?
I'D LIKE YOU HOME TONIGHT.
BUT DAD, I CAN'T--
OH, ALL RIGHT, DAD.
JERRY HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING STORIES.
HE HAS A FASCINA TING JOB.
HE FLIES THOSE--
BILL?
I THOUGHT YOU'D M IGHT LIKE TO HAVE SOME CARDS TONIGHT.
I THOUGHT IT M IGHT TAKE YOUR M IND OFF THINGS.
BILL?
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS HAPPENING?
I HAVE SO MUCH FEAR INSIDE ME I--
I CAN'T GIVE IT WORDS.
EVE, IT'S TOO LATE FOR SUBTERFUGE NOW.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ANYTHING.
IT'S COM ING.
IT'S COM ING PROBABLY WITHIN 48 HOURS.
WILL IT BE BAD?
IT'LL BE A HOLOCAUST.
IT WILL BE HELL.
IT'LL BE THE END OF EVERYTHING.
PEOPLE, PLACES, IDEAS, EVERYTHING.
IT WILL ALL BE WIPED OUT.
IN 48 HOURS?
MAYBE SOONER.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
SIT DOWN ON THE BED A MOMENT, EVE.
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
WE'RE LEAVING.
YOU AND JODY AND I AND JERRY AND ANN.
WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT.
LEAVING?
LEAVING FOR WHERE?
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT BETWEEN M IDNIGHT AND 1 :00
WE'VE GOT TO BE OUT OF HERE AND GONE, AND NO ONE IS TO KNOW.
I MEAN NO ONE, NOT NEIGHBORS, NOT RELATIVES, NOT EVEN JODY.
SHE'S NOT TO KNOW, AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL HER
UNTIL WE'RE ALREADY ON OUR WAY.
DAD?
JERRY RIDEN IS DOWN HERE.
HE'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU.
I'M COMING DOWN, JODY.
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
WHY IS HE HERE?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO FIND OUT.
YOU BETTER TELL SOME FUNNY STORIES TONIGHT, JERRY.
I HAD TO BREAK A DATE FOR YOU.
HI, BILL.
YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE IT FOR CARDS.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S HIGH STAKES TONIGHT
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN VERY HOT AT CARDS THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
I JUST DROPPED BY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT, UH--
YOUR WATCH'S GIVING YOU TROUBLE AGAIN?
UH, YEAH.
PROBABLY THAT MAINSPRING.
IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD SOME RUST ON IT.
HERE, LET ME SEE IT.
NOW, LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.
BILL, WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE OUR PLAN.
NOT YET, NOT YET.
WAIT A M INUTE.
[electric engine whirring]
NOW, THERE'S YOUR TROUBLE, JERRY, RIGHT THERE.
TELL ME, WHAT'S HAPPENED?
THEY'VE PUT A DIFFERENT GUARD ON THE SHIP, ON THE 1 :00 A.M. SHIFT.
THE ONE I KNOW, THE ONE I'VE PAID GETS OFF AT 1 1 :00.
THEN WE HAVE TO LEAVE BEFORE 1 1 :00.
THAT WILL BE A LOT TOUGHER.
THERE ARE MORE MEN ON THE FIELD THEN.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
WE'RE ONLY YOUR RELATIVES WITH PERMISSION TO LOOK AT THE SHIP.
THAT'S WHAT OUR CREDENTIALS WILL SHOW.
JUST THE SAME.
THE FEWER WHO KNOW, THE BETTER.
DOES ANN KNOW, YET?
NOT EVERYTHING.
ONLY THAT WE'RE IN DANGER AND WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT.
I DIDN'T TELL HER WHERE OR WHEN.
WHAT ABOUT EVE AND JODY?
EVE KNOWS NOW.
JODY WILL STAY HOME TONIGHT.
I TOLD HER YOU WERE COMING OVER.
YOU AND ANN TO PLAY CARDS.
YOU CAN COME AROUND 7:00, CAN'T YOU?
YEAH.
I THINK THAT THAT DOES IT, JERRY.
JUST A LITTLE MAINSPRING PROBLEM.
YOU M IGHT WANNA HAVE IT CHECKED BY A JEWELER IN A MONTH OR SO.
I COULDN'T GET ALL THE RUST OUT OF IT.
THANKS, BILL, VERY MUCH.
SIXTEEN.
FOUR.
TWELVE.
EIGHT.
SEVEN.
YOU ARE LUCKY TONIGHT.
HOW ABOUT SOME LEMONADE AND HOMEMADE CAKE, EVERYONE?
SOUNDS WONDERFUL.
WELL, I'LL GET A TRAY.
I'LL HELP YOU WITH IT.
COME ALONG, YOUNG WOMAN, LEND A HAND.
I KNOW OUR DESTINATION NOW.
RIGHT THERE.
HOW FAR?
ELEVEN M ILLION M ILES.
IN A SHIP WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WILL LEAVE THE ATMOSPHERE.
OR WHETHER OR NOT ITS PILOT CAN EITHER TAKE OFF OR GET YOU DOWN IN ONE PIECE.
THAT'S THE RISK, BILL.
THAT'S THE RISK WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS NOW.
IT'S A GOOD RISK WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVES.
NOW, THIS PLACE WE'RE GOING TO.
IT'S POPULATED, BILL.
IT HAS PEOPLE ON IT.
WE'VE PICKED UP RADIO WAVES.
EVEN SOME SNATCHES OF A LANGUAGE NOT DISSIM ILAR TO OURS.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DECIPHER A LOT OF IT.
[doorbell rings]
WITH A LITTLE HELP, A COUPLE OF BREAKS,
AND GOD, WE M IGHT EVEN MAKE IT THERE.
(Eve) BILL, MR. CARLING IS HERE.
WELL, STURKA, A LITTLE CARDS TONIGHT, EH?
A LITTLE CARDS, CARLING.
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO CUT INTO A CAKE.
YOU CARE TO JOIN US?
THANK YOU.
JUST A LITTLE LEMONADE FOR ME.
I WAS JUST TELLING YOUR WIFE THAT SHE MAKES WONDERFUL LEMONADE.
HOT NIGHT, TOO, HUH?
THIS IS A NIGHT FOR A FRONT PORCH,
OR SLEEP.
BUT NOTHING ELSE.
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.
WE'LL BE LEAVING IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
I'VE BEEN UP NORTH TESTING AN AIRCRAFT.
HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SLEEP THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
YES, I KNOW THE AIRCRAFT.
THEY SAY IT'S CAPABLE OF LEAVING OUR ATMOSPHERE.
TALK IS IT COULD GO TO ANOTHER PLANET
IF THE RIGHT MAN FLEW HER.
WELL, NOT FOR AWHILE, YET.
IT NEEDS A LOT MORE TESTING.
OH.
MAY I HAVE A CIGARETTE?
THE WAY I FIGURE IT, MR. STURKA, YOU OWE ANN AND ME A LITTLE MONEY HERE.
MARVELOUS SCIENTIST.
VERY BAD CARD PLAYER.
I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT.
I WOULD'VE GUESSED THAT STURKA HERE WAS A GOOD GAMBLER.
I'D GUESS HE'D GAMBLE ON MOST ANYTHING.
(Eve) HERE WE ARE.
LEMONADE, EVERYONE?
I'LL CUT THE CAKE, EVE.
HEY, YOU'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS, MRS. STURKA.
YOU'RE VERY NERVOUS.
YOU'VE LOST QUITE A BIT ACCORDING TO THIS, STURKA.
WE WON'T SETTLE TONIGHT, UH--
NEXT WEEK, NEXT WEEK WE'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.
NEXT WEEK?
YOU DO PLAN AHEAD.
YOU PLAN WAY AHEAD.
A WEEK?
A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN A WEEK.
A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN 48 HOURS.
WELL, I'LL GET ON HOME NOW.
I LIKE TO TAKE A WALK ON WARM EVENINGS.
IT MAKES ME SLEEP BETTER.
I'LL SEE YOU TO THE DOOR, MR. CARLING.
THANK YOU.
I'LL PROBABLY SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE TOMORROW.
YES, OF COURSE.
PRETTY NIGHT.
CLEAR AS A BELL.
NOTHING BUT STARS.
YOU EVER THINK, STURKA, THAT
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE ON THOSE STARS, TOO?
MAYBE PEOPLE JUST LIKE US.
THAT THOUGHT HAS CROSSED MY M IND.
EVER THINK MAYBE YOU'D BE HAPPIER ON ONE OF THOSE THAN YOU ARE HERE?
THAT THOUGHT HAS CROSSED MY M IND, TOO.
YEAH.
YEAH, I HAVE NO DOUBT.
THE TIME IS NOW.
JODY, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT.
THERE'S A SHIP AT THE GOVERNMENT FIELD.
WE'RE ALL GONNA DRIVE OVER THERE NOW.
WE'VE BRIBED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THE SHIP'S LOADED WITH SUPPLIES.
YOU'VE BEEN PLANNINGTHIS!
FOR THREE MONTHS NOW.
BUT TONIGHT HAS TO BE IT, JODY.
TONIGHT'S THE LAST CHANCE.
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE HERE TONIGHT.
WHY TONIGHT, JERRY?
BECAUSE THIS WORLD AS WE KNOW IT WON'T EXIST MUCH LONGER.
IT'S ABOUT TO BLOW ITSELF UP AND THAT MAY HAPPEN BY MORNING.
WELL, IN THE MORNING WHERE WILL WE BE?
WE'LL BE OUT IN SPACE, JODY.
FAR OUT.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET READY, EVERYBODY.
I'LL BACK THE CAR OUT OF THE GARAGE.
ANN, IS YOUR BAG READY?
IT'S IN OUR BEDROOM.
I'LL GO GET IT.
[phone ringing]
BILL.
[ringing]
I'VE GOT TO ANSWER IT.
[ringing]
YES?
TONIGHT?
WELL, I, UH, I'M IN BED.
[caller hangs up]
THAT WAS MY DIVISION HEAD.
THEY'RE WORKING TONIGHT.
THEY'RE SENDING A CAR OVER FOR ME.
THEN WE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.
I'LL GET OUR BAGS.
THIS IS SILLY, ISN'T IT?
WE AREN'T EVER COM ING BACK HERE AGAIN.
THAT'S IT.
THERE IT IS.
MOTHER, IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT?
IS THAT OUR CONTACT?
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
EVE, FLASH THE LIGHTS, JUST ONCE.
GOOD EVENING, STURKA.
YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM HOME, AREN'T YOU?
NOW, YOU TWO STAND THERE VERY QUIETLY
AND BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE
VERY, VERY QUIETLY.
GET BACK IN THE CAR, PLEASE.
WOULD YOU TWO GET IN THE FRONT SEAT, PLEASE?
WOULD YOU THREE LADIES M IND GETTING OUT?
THESE TWO GENTLEMEN AND I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT
WITH THE AUTHORITIES.
THE GATE.
(man) UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLE ON FIELD!
UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLE ON FIELD!
GUARD UNIT SEVEN APPROACH UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLE.
APPROACH UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLE AND REQUEST IT TO HALT.
[spaceship engine throbbing]
[machinery beeping]
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
1 2:00 AND ALL IS WELL.
[sighs]
THE STARS LOOK FAR AWAY.
THEY ARE FAR AWAY.
BUT THE ONE WE WANT, THAT'S NOT SO FAR, BILL.
SEE IT THERE?
IT'S THE SHINY ONE.
THE BRIGHT ONE OVER ON THE RIGHT.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE.
PEOPLE LIKE US.
PEOPLE LIKE US.
IT'S THE THIRD PLANET FROM THE SUN, BILL.
IT'S CALLED
EARTH.
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING.
TO A PLACE CALLED EARTH.
(male presenter) BEHIND A TINY SHIP HEADING INTO SPACE

Congratulations, Annie.
It's all yours.
It's hard to believe.
Scott, that goes to the downstairs bath.
I don't know how... we're ever going to be able to afford this... but it is perfect.
There's only one thing missing.
Get me the dolly, will you?
I remember that photo.
Even Czonka's smiling.
You sent it out as a Christmas card last year.
Mm-hmm.
It belongs right there, doesn't it?
Mm.
Mom!
Sean says I have dragon breath!
You don't believe me, go ahead and sniff her.
I hate that photo.
That dress makes me look chunky!
-What dress doesn't?
-Mom!
So much for my perfect moment, huh?
Hey, I said no skateboarding indoors!
Whoa!
Easy, Czonka, easy!
How 'bout backing me up here?
Come on, honey.
It's moving day.
Czonka!
Czonky, bad boy!
Help...please.
Someone, anyone?
You'll be fine, Annie.
Call me if you need anything, OK?
-Philip.
-Thank you.
Annie, I just have to say that you were right.
It feels just like home already.
Czonka!
What?
What?
What?
Oh, boy.
Don't tell me it's only moving day.
Where'd I put those paper towels?
Honey, relax.
Phillip, we've been here fifteen minutes... and already the hardwood is scraped... and the fireplace is stained.
They're kids, Annie.
The dog got excited.
Phillip, this is supposed to be a fresh start, a new beginning.
Just because we have a new house... doesn't mean we're gonna turn into a new family.
Sometimes I wish we could.
Annie had it on the truck.
Does that make me a terrible person?
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
Czonka, you bad dog!
Go give Mommy some love.
Oh.
Very funny.
Don't tell me...
Czonka's already made a new friend.
What are you talking about?
Come here, Czonk.
Come here.
Good boy!
Who's my champ!
That's right, Czonka is!
What's wrong?
Stop screwing around, Phillip.
I mean it.
This isn't funny.
If you bought another dog...
Do you know what Mommy is talking about?
Of course you don't.
Neither do I.
This is the wrong day for silly games.
Perfection.
Isn't that something we all yearn for?
Annie Macintosh does.
She wants the perfect house, the perfect family... the perfect life... but she's about to learn that perfection is an illusion... and a terrifying one at that... in The Twilight Zone.
You're traveling to another dimension-- a dimension not only of sight and sound... but of mind.
A journey into a wondrous land... whose boundaries are only that of the imagination.
You're entering...
Satisfied?
I don't understand.
What happened to Czonka?
I really wish you'd stop saying that.
You're gonna give him a complex.
That is not my dog.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Look at his AKC papers.
Look at his ribbons, his champion certificate.
-How much proof do you need?
-It's not my dog!
Annie, you love this dog!
Hell, there are days you think you like him better than me.
Why are you pretending you don't recognize him?
Go away.
Phillip, get him away.
Czonka, sit.
Sean is stapling his posters to the wall.
You're a traitor, you know that?
-And they shoot traitors.
-Leave me alone!
-ls that a new zit?
-I hate you!
That's not my dog.
Annie, listen to me very carefully.
I've seen this before... and buying your first home can be very difficult.
There's escrow, inspections... it's a lot of stress.
So what you're saying is I've owned a poodle... for five years...
and never realized it.
I've had clients forget their own names... the year it was, how many children they had.
I knew this one guy who, every day for three months... drove back to his old apartment after work.
What's that got to do with me?
I've got two teenagers.
I eat stress for breakfast.
Which is why I'm not worried about you.
Then stop looking so worried.
I just want you to remember we ran the numbers.
You are not in over your head.
You got a great deal here.
Told you buying a model home was the way to go.
What are you really trying to say, Yasmine?
I'm saying...relax.
Everything is gonna be OK.
This is your home.
And that... is your dog.
What's that?
French champagne.
Talk about optimistic.
I'm so sorry it's been such a tough day.
I'm sorry if I freaked you out.
Does that mean I can open up the champagne?
Down, boy!
Annie, I just want to say...
I know that I was reluctant to move... but I am so glad that you talked me into it.
Now, if I could talk you into something...
Just pretend he's not there.
I can't.
-Mom.
-Hmm?
You forgot to buy syrup.
You know I hate plain waffles.
I'll go shopping today.
Tess, I made you a special surprise for lunch.
-lt better be egg salad.
-How'd you guess?
Morning.
Love you.
Who--who was that?
Mom, cut it out.
Tess...
I asked you a question.
Who is that boy, and what's he doing in our house?
Mom, come on.
First it was Czonka, and now it's Sean?
Sean?
Wh-what are you talking about?
That isn't Sean.
Dad!
Mom's acting weird again!
Sean!
Get down here right n--
Mom?
What's wrong?
Phillip!
Phillip!
Phillip!
Aah!
Mom!
You'll be just fine.
Just get some rest.
We're good here.
She's gonna be fine.
Annie?
You gave us quite a scare.
What happened?
You took a little tumble, but you're gonna be OK.
The paramedics said you might have a slight concussion.
Ohh...
Sean...
Tess...
where are they?
Kids, your mom wants to see you.
No.
No.
Those are not our children.
Time for school, you two.
You're late enough already.
Come on.
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Mom.
See ya later.
Sean and Tess...
Annie, sit, sit.
Phillip!
Don't you care?
Our children are missing!
Listen to me, Annie.
Our kids are on their way to school.
I've never seen those two before in my life.
Don't you know your own children?
Of course I do!
You're confused.
No, I'm not!
You're the one that's confused!
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with everybody?
Annie, calm down!
Oh, God!
What if it happens to you?
-What if you vanish next?
-I'm not going anywhere.
How can I be sure?
I don't want to lose you!
You're not going to.
Ohh...
No...
No.
Annie...what's wrong?
Oh, no, no, no.
No...
Phillip-- or whoever you are-- just go away!
Annie, it's me.
Yasmine.
Yasmine.
Is that really you?
At least you haven't changed.
Did you see him?
Did you see Phillip?
He called me.
He asked me to come speak with you.
But did you see him?
Annie, he's downstairs.
And...
And he's very concerned about you.
And you didn't notice anything different about him?
Annie, I know this is hard for you to believe... but...
Phillip is still Phillip... just like Czonka's still Czonka... the kids are still the kids.
None of them have changed.
Oh...
-I am not going crazy.
-No one says you are.
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explanation.
Yeah, you're right.
There is.
I changed them.
You lost me.
I remember telling Phillip l...
I wished for the perfect family to go with all of this.
And?
My wish... it's come true.
Heh.
Yasmine, this is not funny!
I'm sorry.
It's just...
You trust me, Annie?
I want to.
Then come downstairs with me.
Why?
I want to show you something.
Look at me, Annie.
I'm still Yasmine, right?
I haven't changed.
Come downstairs.
This isn't my furniture.
Our sofa was ten years old.
The stereo.
Phillip wanted this stereo, but it was $10,000--
OK, OK.
Let's just pretend for a second... that everything you've told me is true... that--that this isn't your furniture... and this isn't your family... and somehow everything's changed.
Oh, Annie, don't you get it?
Don't you see?
Any way you look at it... you got what you wanted.
Honey, you've traded up.
So...how's the new school?
The campus looks very nice.
I love the tennis courts.
They have stadium seating and everything.
I met my new swim coach today.
He won a bronze medal at the '88 Olympics.
Well, it seems like you two are really going to love it here.
How's work, Dad?
Well, you know that biotech company that I made an offer on?
We closed the deal today.
Cool!
That's great!
Isn't that great, Mom?
Yes.
It's--it's great.
So, Mom, um, is your head feeling any better?
Hey, you remember that time that I got beaned in little league?
You played little league?
I guess I forgot.
I think I'll get some more wine.
OK.
This is what you wanted... the perfect family, the perfect home...
"To the best mom in the world.
"We love you more than you'll ever know.
"Tess and Sean."
And you love me, too, right?
You're a good dog.
This is your family now.
They love you.
They need you.
You're gonna have to try to make this work.
She's not getting any better, Dad.
If anything, she's getting worse.
I know.
What are we gonna do?
We have to help her.
We're gonna do whatever it takes to make her better.
I've already made some calls.
Will she have to go away?
Just for a little while.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
Honey, is that you?
This is Yasmine.
Please leave your name... number, and a brief message.
Have a great day.
Yasmine, if you're there, pick up!
Yasmine, please!
I don't know what to do.
They're gonna send me away.
Annie, where are you?
Oh, God, they're coming.
Mom?
Where are you?
Annie.
What are you doing?
No!
You leave me al-alone.
Help me, please!
Ohh...
No...
No!
There you are.
Are you OK, Annie?
I was just looking at our picture... thinking how lucky I am.
I have a wonderful family... a beautiful new home.
It's perfect.
Just like you.
Lizzie.
Dinner.
I'll be right there.
I just finished upgrading my digital family game.
Just a game?
Or is it?
How do we know we aren't all just characters... in some computer game called life?
And at any moment, each of us could be replaced... by someone a little smarter... a little younger... a little more...
perfect?
THE LIPSTICK
Look at her!
Don't worry.
He'll come.
Hi.
I'll never, ever wait for a man.
Let's go to the park and time couples kissing.
Leave them alone.
I hate those games.
Yesterday I saw two lovers kiss for 53 seconds.
What about breathing?
There he is!
Not bad!
What's his name?
Gino.
Gino Luciani.
- Who's his woman?
- Ask her; she'd know.
- Does he heave a girlfriend?
- Not really.
Being a salesman, at least a couple of his clients' wives.
- Do you speak to him?
- In her dreams!
- Whenever I feel like it!
- Sure...
Is that so?
Go on... speak to him.
Excuse me...
Someone was trying...
Someone tried to break into your car.
He tried twice, then went away.
- Is it valuable?
- My boss thinks so.
It's all there.
- I like that tune.
- You play it on your guitar.
That's right...
You live opposite me, don't you?
She knows all about you.
She's in love.
- Who with?
- With you, of course!
No...
That's not true.
It's not.
Big mouth!
- Can you tell I've been crying?
- Of course.
Did you fall?
No.
I cried for moral reasons.
- What?
!
- You can't understand.
- I don't believe you...
- Good morning.
Just say you're tired.
Don't look for excuses.
I never said you shouldn't respect your wife...
"Respect her"...
Of course.
You use your family as an excuse...
Of course.
That's what it's all about.
When in need, any excuse is a good excuse.
Yes, I want to see you.
Just one more time.
Yes, I'll calm down.
We can meet wherever you say.
A café down in the street...
Try to understand me too.
I've waited for your call.
Staring at the phone all day like an idiot.
The fact is, you know how to make me suffer.
Enrico, I'll do what you suggested for my daughter.
I found a boarding school.
She'll like it.
So we could...
Don't you agree?
Now you want me to stay with my daughter?
How kind of you.
How typical!
I don't want to offend you.
I just want to see you.
Just like that, on the phone...
After two years?
Listen, Enrico, I won't do that again.
I won't call you at home or at the office.
But don't leave me.
I love you, Enrico.
No, don't hang up!
Mum, what's the matter?
Mum...
- Are you ill?
- No.
Don't send me to boarding school.
Silvana, be quiet.
I want to stay here.
- Take your hands off!
- This is ready for delivery.
Silvana, remember to take it to number 22... or is it 24?
No, it's 22...
Don't follow me.
I won't make up with you.
You should thank me.
At least now he knows.
I don't meddle in your business.
- He has no time for you.
- I'll lure him to me.
- How?
By stripping?
- Vincenzo, come here.
There's been a crime at number 4.
They called the police.
Walter, take a look.
A real police car!
Vincenzo, who did they kill?
Go home, you little brat!
- A man or a woman?
- Go away, I said.
I was delivering her mail.
She wouldn't answer.
But I could hear the phone and television.
I thought she might be ill.
I had the key... so I came in.
- Her name?
- Natalina Sensi.
- Was she married?
- I don't think so.
- Was she working?
- Sure, as a hooker.
Another messy case...
- Is Mauri here?
- He's picking up the judge.
- Is he a relative too?
- No.
Only the Commissioner.
- Good morning, Mr. Mauri.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Your Honour.
A really beautiful woman...
Another working girl.
Your Honour, do you mind if the forensic team...
A full picture first...
then a close-up of the head.
The murder weapon...
and a close-up of her face.
- Was she one of them?
- They're being killed like flies.
Like the one in the paper, found tied-up and naked.
Strangled with electric wire.
This one was different.
- What's happened?
- A woman's been killed.
You live on the same floor?
They want to question you.
- Photographer!
- Yes?
- What do you think?
- She must have died around 2.
- Was she an addict?
- What?
Do you know whether she took any drugs?
Did she ever look strange?
Like she was possessed?
- No.
- Did she have a pimp?
Someone who was regularly with her?
- No.
- Any regular clients?
Lately a short guy with a fringe... spectacles...
But I don't know him.
Any friends in the building?
I don't think so.
She behaved like a real lady.
For fear of being evicted.
Check the drawers in the other room.
What was this Natalina like?
Kind or nasty?
- She was kind to me.
- Any tips?
I wouldn't accept them, knowing what she was doing.
- Any enemies?
- Not that I know of.
- Found anything?
- Not a thing.
She kept this place spotless.
- The meat tenderiser?
- No fingerprints.
The bedroom?
A few fingerprints, possibly from her last client.
I'd love to know who it was.
- What have you found?
- Invoices, correspondence...
- Guess what...
- She had a child out to nurse.
- Where's the father?
- Working in a Belgian mine.
Poor devil.
What do you think?
A robbery?
Poor wretches...
Their clients don't even ask their names.
A needle in a haystack.
Did your mother make her dresses?
A couple of times.
From my room, I'd peep through the keyhole.
What was she like?
Well... she didn't look like one of them.
The funeral already?
First they'll take her to the morgue.
I work upstairs.
May I go up?
By all means.
Excuse me, officer.
- Where was she from?
- Friuli.
Friuli, eh?
Typical Friuli woman!
Everybody here fears being mentioned in the papers.
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.
- Of the papers?
- You never win.
So you don't want to talk?
Yes, but when it comes to other tenants...!
He knows absolutely nothing.
Can you remember anyone she used to mix with?
- Anyone?
- Yes... any client.
- "Client"?
- Wasn't she a teacher?
- That's right, a teacher.
- A relative of theirs?
- No, a boarder.
- Did he know the deceased?
- No.
- Ever spoken with her?
- Never.
- Occupation?
- Cosmetics salesman.
What were you doing between 1 and 2?
I had lunch and retired to my room.
He was in his room playing his guitar.
I took some coffee to him.
Inspector, the bar boy.
- Come on.
- Who's that?
- Be quiet!
Cool it.
Don't get excited.
- You brought her water?
- Sort of...
I was supposed to, but she didn't answer.
Did you ring the bell?
Yes, but nobody answered.
Then I went back downstairs.
Let's go and chat.
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
- Calm down.
- I didn't do anything!
- I never liked her face...
- Why was she killed?
- What's Vincenzo done?
- How should I know?
Augusta!
They arrested the bar boy.
Vincenzo?
Are they crazy?
They say he did it...
Good evening.
- What are you waiting for?
- Cut it out!
I haven't made up with you yet.
There he is!
Franca, come and see the murderer!
What murderer, you bitch?
!
Are you crazy?
Let me go!
I didn't do anything.
Help me!
I had nothing to do with all this!
Gino, you tell them I didn't do anything.
There's no need to treat him like that.
You know me.
I didn't do anything.
Listen here, you bastard!
- I'll have you banned.
- Am I worried?
You buffoon!
Vincenzo, don't worry!
You'll be all right.
They just picked him at random.
- They're not stupid.
- He's a good guy.
As if a crim would own up to you!
Watch what you say.
Do you have any proof at all?
Take it easy.
Why don't you call his mother?
You're right.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm going to talk to him.
- It's raining.
- Let's go.
I thought she was gorgeous.
Remember how she walked?
Remember?
She was great.
But if I'd satisfied my inclination...
I'd be in trouble, like poor Vincenzo.
- Didn't you satisfy it?
- Me?
More like you did!
You were always ogling her.
You were saving up for her.
Anyway, it's your business.
Just try repeating that!
Come on, knock it off and go home.
Hello.
Mrs. Donadio, please.
Giuseppe, the jacket.
- Hello.
- Look at that!
Hello...
Is this yours?
Look, I wanted to tell you my friend is stupid.
- I swear it isn't true.
- What isn't?
What she said.
That you're in love with me?
They're bringing her down.
- Stop pushing.
- You stop pushing!
- She was so pretty.
- You knew her?
Yes.
So did you, didn't you?
- Me?
- Yes...
I saw you leave her place once.
Like one?
I must fetch the poor woman.
We didn't need this tragedy.
- When?
- About a week ago.
You're crazy.
You're mistaking me for someone else.
What a funny kid!
If someone heard you, I'd be in trouble.
You needn't worry.
I swear I'll keep quiet.
No need.
It's not true.
Silvana, it's late, isn't it?
I have to go and deliver this now.
Excuse me.
Good night.
Wait...
Aren't you going out later?
No, I'm not allowed out at night.
Anyway, it's pouring.
Listen... what are you doing tomorrow?
I'm going to the cinema.
- Which one?
- The Alcione.
I'll be there at three.
Okay...
Good night.
What did he want?
What did he say?
You gave me a sleepless night.
- I didn't say a word.
- I hope not.
I realise you'd be embarrassed.
You think I'd go with a woman like that?
Many do.
I don't.
You really want to cause me trouble.
I didn't breathe a word!
Prisons are full of innocent people.
If the police start thinking I knew that woman...
I'm finished.
I might get released later... but I could lose my job, for instance.
Of course.
In my job, I need people to respect me.
- Mum's the word.
- No, just accept you're wrong.
It was the lift you saw me coming out of.
- You got confused.
- Try another one!
You don't know me.
If I say I'll keep quiet, I will.
Does your mum know you're here?
No, she has other things on her mind.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.
Why?
Why don't you?
Well, you never know with women today.
And I'd like mine to be exactly as I want her to be.
Understand?
What's that on your lips?
Nothing.
- How old are you?
- 14.
- Can I buy you an ice-cream?
- I should buy you one.
- Would you like one?
- I don't like them.
- It's late...
- You're leaving?
- Yes...
I'm sorry.
Tell me the story next time.
- Tomorrow?
- Okay...
- But you won't talk?
- You won't make fun of me?
Why should I?
You're a good girl, aren't you?
It depends.
Ice-cream?
A choc-ice.
Look...
When this ray reaches my eyes... it'll be almost 5 o'clock.
You know this room, don't you?
You hated it the first time.
Yes, it felt so humiliating the first time.
I never told you.
Besides...
Besides...
I was afraid.
I watched the door for anyone spying on us.
But now this place feels like our home.
I even like the voices and footsteps in the corridor.
Promise we'll come back after we're married.
- Just like two lovers.
- Yes...
We'll come here often.
Come here...
come close to me.
Today I had a row with my stubborn father.
He wanted the wedding his way...
In private.
No way!
The Piazza Navona church... an orchestra, friends and photographers.
You almost made the papers too!
What was she like, that poor woman who died?
- You must have seen her.
- Yes, a few times.
Was she pretty?
Not so much pretty, but she stood out.
Scrubbed up well, but still a streetwalker.
- Killed with a tenderiser?
- Yes, it seems so.
- She was hit on the head?
- That's right.
How many times?
Did she die instantly?
Listen... do we have to talk about that?
I love these news stories.
Actually, I'd love to see the scene of the crime.
Let's go there now.
I have till 8 o'clock.
You have some funny ideas!
I want to see where you live.
Why haven't you taken me?
My landladies are jealous of visitors.
They're two old ladies.
They're like some mothers... jealous and boring.
Besides...
What do you expect to see?
Bloodstains on the stairs?
I'll be moving in two weeks.
But we'll be married by then.
Listen, Lorella...
We'd better postpone the wedding.
I'd like to have some money before we marry.
But Gino... what's wrong?
Whenever things look good, something happens.
Why do you say that?
For fear of losing something beautiful.
And I'll smack you.
Wait.
You were a hit.
- The concierge eyed you up.
- Come on!
He's secretly in love with you.
Arrested Bar Boy Slashes His Wrists in Suicide Attempt
- Hi, little chimp.
- Hello.
Did you read about Vincenzo?
Yes, and he may not even have anything to do with it.
He really loves his mother.
How can they think he could kill someone?
Well, cops are paid to put people in jail.
Why do people slash their wrists to kill themselves?
Don't you have a livelier topic?
- What do you have there?
- Don't you write in your job?
What a lovely thought.
Thank you.
Bye.
Charge!
I keep my promises, you know.
You again?
I had to tell you about the film.
- Remember?
- Yes, but I can't now.
You don't work on Sundays, do you?
No, but...
Well, if you're expecting someone...
- Just tell me.
- Of course I'm not.
So she says, "I can't marry you,"
but he insists, because he loves her.
Anyway, it's obvious that she likes him.
Then they meet on a hill where there's a tree...
Yes, a single, solitary tree.
She realises she's pregnant while he's in Korea.
Planes come, machine guns fire...
Mayhem!
Even though you don't see it, you know he's been hit.
- He dies.
- Listen...
- Where are you going?
- I'd better go.
You're obsessed!
If you don't want people to see us, we can meet in secret.
- I'll wave from my window.
- Yes.
Bye.
Lorella, come on.
- I kept ringing, but no answer.
- Sorry, the boss kept me.
- Where are your landladies?
- They're out.
You should calm down.
- Does this overlook the road?
- No, the courtyard.
- There's no privacy here.
- This isn't a bad place...
Darling, is it true that you played in restaurants years ago?
They told my father that.
Don't your family approve?
It's not that...
But my father tried to make me change my mind again.
So why don't you make him happy?
Marry one of your friends... some silvertail who went to university.
Go on.
It's not too late.
No, darling.
Slap me.
- I deserve it.
- I'm not like your friends.
It's partly because you're poor that I love you.
Your father only cares about money.
But darling, I admire you.
You struggled to get where you are...
Should I steal to please your father?
I understand your fears but I'll repay your suffering.
Oh, Gino, I'll never lose you again.
Do you love me?
Gino...
I'll never lose you again.
We're united, united forever.
You understand, Gino?
United forever.
Then it's true...
Isn't that what you wanted, too?
Yes...
But what about your father?
They used to throw girls like me out of the house.
But now...
My father didn't say so, but he wouldn't mind me seeing a doctor.
Our parents are so immoral!
- Where was the crime scene?
- Over there.
Yes, the rings are ready.
But look, let's keep it simple... without too many guests or photographers.
Yes, low key.
Look, I'll hang up now, because people are waiting to call.
Okay.
I'll call you tonight.
Bye.
I love you.
Hi there, little chimp.
How are things?
- Who were you laughing with?
- Toto!
Doesn't your mother ever look for you?
Guess who's coming to Rome?
Pe...
You have a stammer too!
Listen...
Come back here.
- Who's coming to Rome?
- Perry Como.
- "Magic moments..." Going to see him?
- Are you?
With your girlfriend?
I'll really have to call the doctor!
I know she's a slim girl... and wears a blue dress.
Leave me alone, will you?
Very well...
I'll leave you alone.
Come here.
- Silvana...
- No!
Don't make me beg you.
Calm down.
Come on.
Keep your head down.
If I'm seen with a child they'll lynch me.
What a mess!
I think we'd better cut this short.
Let's go to the police and tell them everything... but we have to end this.
- You'll end up in a home.
- Where are you going?
Stay down!
Do you take me for a saint?
In that case, let me out.
See that?
It's the police station.
I'll take you inside, unless you promise to stop it.
Very well...
Scared, aren't you?
You're lucky I'm smart enough not to ruin you.
Are you going to marry that girl?
- Why are you laughing?
- No reason.
You took her home.
But I won't marry her.
She's married.
- I can't remember her name.
- Come on!
I swear.
Maybe Anna, or Gianna...
I don't know.
Where are you going now?
To see some clients.
Will you come with me?
Some music...
Hear that?
It's your song, isn't it?
Sorry, I meant our song.
You're funny, you know.
And pretty, too.
Who knows what sort of woman you'll grow into.
Show me your eyes.
What colour are they?
Grey.
Grey with yellow flecks.
Have you got a boyfriend who loves you?
There was one, but I told him to scram.
- No kisses?
- He tried.
- So why not?
- I didn't want to.
You fibber.
- Look who's talking!
- I'm a travelling salesman.
But I like to be honest when it come to personal things.
- I want to put you to the test.
- With a truth potion?
- I want to ask a question.
- Go ahead.
Was that woman the wife of a client?
How did you guess?
Is that how you make your business deals?
You don't know how tough life is.
If you've made enough at the end of the month, fine.
If not, they'll employ someone else.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not justifying myself.
I know it was wrong.
Will you be seeing that woman again?
No.
Happy now?
An ant.
You said I'm a little chimp.
But you're more of a chimp.
Look.
Now we bring you a collection of songs... by The Gentlemen of Rhythm.
Are you angry?
I kissed you because I'm fond of you.
But swear that you won't talk.
Swear.
You won't talk, will you?
But now we have to work.
Come on.
It has no scent.
Does that matter?
And what can I give you?
What counts is that we share a secret.
No, I want to give you a gift.
A proper gift.
Something important.
A nice record.
A record of your favourite song...
Our song.
Okay?
But you mustn't tell anyone I gave it to you.
Is that clear?
Here, have a drink.
Silvana!
- Liar!
- They belong to a friend.
Liar!
- Listen to me...
- No, I don't believe you.
A policeman came today, but I kept quiet.
I could've sent you to jail for a week!
Don't be like that.
I'll explain everything, Silvana.
Some story about the lift!
You were inside her home.
- Why did you kiss me?
- Be reasonable.
You'll see how reasonable I can be.
Look, I don't want to hurt you.
But if you...
Don't force me to...
You won't lead me up the garden path.
Hit me!
Go on, hit me!
Hit me!
Silvana!
Silvana, come back here!
Don't be scared!
Have you seen Silvana?
No, I haven't.
Sir, a policeman was looking for you.
- When?
- Just now.
There he is.
You're Gino Luciani?
The Inspector wants to see you.
Get in.
- Why?
- The Inspector will tell you.
Come on.
Gino!
They released me!
They released me.
I'm free!
- Mum!
- Vincenzo!
Mum, it's all over!
- You have good eyesight?
- Well...
Yes.
I mean, you'd surely notice a woman like that.
- Yes.
- I'd have made a pass at her.
You had her right there on the same landing.
In short, did you know who she was or not?
Well, I admit I did know... just like everyone else.
Think carefully, or are you afraid?
Seems very convenient for everyone to be afraid.
Don't you agree?
None of the tenants talked of their own accord.
They're scared of the press, the tax-man, mothers-in-law...
"I know nobody, I saw nothing..."
It was like pulling teeth... just getting them to say they'd spoken to her on the stairs.
- We've finished here.
- Can they go, sir?
- Yes.
- Come through.
- About time.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, but... your relationships... forgive me...
How do you meet women?
- Like everyone else does.
- Phone for you, Mr. Fioresi.
Is it prostitutes...
or is there a steady friend?
I'm engaged to be married.
It's from a public phone.
Yes?
Who's the murderer?
Mr. Francesco Molaioli?
Of 119 Viale Tiziano.
Who's calling?
Who's calling?
A self-appointed informer!
You deal with it.
Who do we call now?
I want to see her relatives, the man who sold her the car... and the seamstress who lives opposite.
- We'll find something.
- Okay.
- Anonymous letters?
- Yes.
And they say there are too many illiterates in Italy!
You're very quiet too...
If I knew something, I'd tell you, Inspector.
- You may go.
- Thank you.
One letter says a sex maniac killed her.
A maniac who steals a million in jewels!
Listen to this...
Mr. Molajoli of 119 Viale Tiziano died yesterday.
He'd been paralysed for two years.
What an amusing joke.
What a barrel of laughs!
Did you want to tell me something?
Well, Inspector...
About those people you mentioned... who write letters and call you...
Yes?
There's a young girl...
The type who's obsessed with actors and singers.
She likes to tease me.
She's invented seeing me leave the dead woman's flat.
- She invented it?
- Yes, it amuses her.
Besides, between us, she's rather precocious...
You know how some girls are.
She thought this would be a way of latching onto me.
And as I'm ignoring her, she says she'll get me in trouble.
- Why are you telling me?
- I'm fed up.
I said I'd tell you, unless she stopped.
She seems to have settled down a bit now... but you never know.
It's still worrying.
You never visited Natalina?
Not even once?
- Would I be telling you?
- What's her name?
- Silvana De Caroli.
- The seamstress's daughter.
We've found one of Natalina's clients, a Professor Tassi...
Short, with glasses, a fringe, in his forties...
- Check him out.
- The description fits.
You...
You understand my position, don't you?
- I've put myself in your hands.
- Yes.
- Goodbye.
Inspector, I hadn't seen Natalina for a month.
Why have I been involved?
This isn't the end of it!
Professor Tassi Released
Silvana, how are you?
Remember me?
I came to talk to your mother.
- We have some questions.
- Hello, Silvana.
Did you see Gino coming out of that woman's door?
The police know everything, but Gino himself told us.
- He told you?
- He says you harrass him.
He said you're in love with him.
- Didn't he?
- Yes, he did.
Are you in love with him or not?
No...
So why did you make up that story?
- Did you see him leaving?
- Or is it a lie?
It must be a lie...
It must be.
- Shall I catch her?
- With your stomach?
Come now, I didn't say he's the murderer.
- Look at all these suits!
- What does he earn?
70, 80... 80, does he?
He played guitar between 1 and 2?
Yes, while we had lunch.
Almost always, right, Cecilia?
- We had a competition.
- I tried to guess the tune.
- And he never stopped?
- Well, he isn't a gramophone.
Okay, let's try it.
I'll play, then...
Go.
Okay...
She was expecting you.
I'll play Natalina.
"Hello, dear".
Kisses...
- The meal is ready...
- The meal's ready.
Let's suppose we both go into the kitchen...
I get the wine, you get the meat tenderiser...
She sits down and you strike.
One, two, three, four...
Drop the tenderiser...
The jewels from the drawer!
Wait, the gloves!
Come on, hurry.
Yes, that's it.
Go through the drawers.
The jewels are in the one on the right.
Yes, in the drawer.
Come on, hurry.
Yes, but walk like a murderer.
Yes, that's it.
Slowly...
The door...
Wait...
Someone might be there.
Open it...
No-one's there...
- Win the pools?
- Wishful thinking!
Three minutes and fifty seconds.
Assuming she opened the door immediately.
If not, at least five minutes.
It's not unlikely she was waiting.
Let's suppose they'd agreed to meet.
Couldn't he have stopped playing for five minutes?
Inspector, don't make me say things I'm not sure about.
- But you didn't move?
- Me?
No.
You did.
You looked for some lyrics.
That's right!
I went looking for the words to a song.
- Did Gino ask you to?
- Yes, I think so.
- How long did it take you?
- A few minutes, I'd say.
Fancy believing that child!
Children's testimonies...
They're very open and have no other motives.
They don't fear the press.
They lie and don't know the importance of what they say.
I could quote numerous psychology books.
- But maybe you...
- What?
- Nothing...
He was at the tailor's.
How do you pay for all these suits?
In instalments.
Where did you put the jewels?
What jewels?
What's the point of being honest?
I'm not involved in this.
I swear on my mother's head!
Leave your mother out of it.
You have nothing to fear.
Come on.
What were you doing on the stairs?
I was delivering a dress.
He said he came out of the lift.
It was the lift, then.
So why tell Gino it was her door?
I thought it was the door.
How could you mistake a lift for a door?
Well, maybe I'm stupid.
She's even pretending embarrassment.
- Maybe she is.
- She's obviously acting.
You can't believe this is the truth!
Go on then, laugh.
It's outrageous.
You like him, don't you?
Don't be afraid to answer.
It can happen at your age.
No need to be ashamed.
- As long as you're clean...
- Clean?
Her?
Pull the other one!
You don't get it, do you?
Don't be influenced by her age, or her saintly looks.
Romantic love, indeed!
She provoked me like an adult.
Smiles, glances, sweet words...
The lot!
Clean?
This one?
She blackmailed me.
I can't even leave the house without her spying on me... asking if I have a fiancée... and saying "Leave her, or I'll go to the police".
Perhaps you misunderstood.
- I never said that.
- Not in so many words.
But she made it clear at the cinema.
Go on, deny it.
You went to the cinema?
Did your mother know?
Bring her in.
I went to the cinema alone, and she followed me.
Come in, madam.
- Do you know what your daughter did on...
- Thursday.
- On Thursday?
- No, I don't know.
You don't?
Sit down, madam.
I'm very busy.
I can't keep an eye on her all the time.
Why?
What's going on?
She went to the cinema with that gentleman.
- What about your work?
- I was free till five.
- Did you see her after that?
- No.
That's not good enough.
Someone saw her in your car.
I almost forgot!
I drove her to the police station... to show her I was serious about the police.
So why didn't you go in?
She's just a child.
You were seen at three.
Then we met at seven.
Did you go to the cinema again?
Silvana, say something.
- We went to visit clients.
- Where?
We listened to the radio in the countryside.
- Why?
- Because...
Why take her to the countryside?
Did he touch you?
- What do you take me for?
!
- Shut up.
Didn't you get tired of just listening to the radio?
Talk, damn you!
What do you take me for?
!
- Scared she'll talk?
- And say what?
It's no use getting excited now.
You should have told her mother.
Instead, you encouraged her.
Forget about me.
Just tell your mother.
I'll kill you...
And you, too.
I have a right to know.
Make him talk, Inspector.
If you touched her, I'll beat you senseless!
I'll have her seen by a doctor.
- Why not have her X-rayed?
!
- Really?
Why are you doing this?
He's done nothing.
Nothing?
Not even a kiss?
On the cheek.
No need to over-react.
Go to the other room now.
Take her to the doctor.
Only if the mother consents.
Now you're really in for it.
You take that girl's lies for gospel truth.
- Isn't it true you kissed her?
- It's all lies.
I asked her as a brother to leave me alone.
To get her to keep her mouth shut.
Go on, confess!
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm fine.
- Obey.
- No.
- Obey.
- I'm perfectly all right.
- I'm fine.
- Go in.
Rossana, did he ring?
Yes?
What did you tell him?
No, you fool!
Call him back at the office... and tell him to call me at home anytime tonight.
Is that clear?
Repeat it.
At any time.
Good.
No, no...
She's a good girl.
How could you think such a thing?
Very well...
We won't say you're a monster...
But the money...
Where did you get the money?
What money?
Do you spend to eat well?
- Yes.
- Well, I make do.
- Do you smoke?
- If you don't mind.
Ask my boss.
I hardly smoke.
- He smokes very little.
- American cigarettes.
- What about the car?
- The car belongs to my boss.
- Okay, get him to sign and bring in his fiancée.
- Okay.
- Miss Severano...
- Goodbye.
Why drag her into this?
- Not you.
- I want this cleared up...
Yes, later.
- I must see the Inspector.
- Later.
I'm sorry.
Gino...
- Where's the child?
- In the room.
Mum...
What?
I hope we won't spend the night here.
- You're in a hurry?
- I want to go home.
Silvana...
I...
I'd like to apologise.
Why did you keep it all to yourself?
To spare you any useless trouble.
I thought you knew my priorities.
If you saw that woman just once, I forgive you.
You're crazy.
- Perhaps... before we met?
- No, never.
- Are you accusing me, too?
- Oh, no.
It'll soon be over, you'll see.
It's ridiculous.
He swears he's innocent.
Isn't that so?
Gino's done nothing wrong.
I'm sure of that.
- So you trust him, then?
- Yes.
But he doesn't feel the same.
For instance, he didn't tell you about the girl.
Has he ever asked you for money?
Look, you're mistaken.
Very much so.
Well, if it wasn't you, it was someone else.
He's been spending more than he earns.
Her friends used to call her 'Grisbi', because she had savings.
But lately she'd dipped into them.
You cost her money, eh?
Trust...
How stupid of me!
That's why people stay away, even with information.
- They still end up in that chair.
- You hate an empty chair!
You arrest the first possible person.
So here I am, an innocent man being framed.
You talk too much.
You're furious because there are murderers at large... and you can't arrest them.
Murderers wandering the streets, going to the cinema, to cafés and the football!
I wouldn't want one more.
Do you follow?
Answer me...
How did you afford your clothes, your rings and your lifestyle?
You're spending 200,000 lire a month, yet you only earn 70-80,000.
How do you manage that?
Excuse me, but could I ask you... how you can afford that gold watch on your wage?
- He has it in for me.
- He won the pools.
- How lucky.
- And did you win the pools?
If a guy saves a quid to lead a decent life... you say he's on 200,000.
Fine by me.
Sir, the girls are here.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
Sit over there.
Evening...
The producer liked me, but there's no film.
Sure.
Go inside.
Go on...
Turn around.
Turn around!
- Ever seen this hunk before?
- I wouldn't forget him.
Gino Luciani.
Ever heard of him?
- Why the tears?
- This one always cries.
I'm married.
Nobody knows I'm a hooker.
- But you came to my home.
- Have a smoke.
You've ruined me and my husband.
Come on, girls, try to tell me something.
- I have something to say.
- Then go ahead.
- But promise me...
- It won't leave this room.
No, I want to make the papers!
I even have photos.
You want to be a star?
- So what's the difference?
- That's enough.
Go on, then.
When I phoned Grisbi about her getting married, she said she'd found a man she liked.
- Who was it?
- A handsome guy, she said.
Name?
Occupation?
I don't know.
We weren't all that close.
But she said he liked music.
Like 50 million other Italians!
- Guitar?
- She only mentioned songs.
Natalina wasn't new to romance, right?
It was like an illness to her.
- Like two years ago.
- She needed a pimp then.
Did she financially support the guy she liked?
- Expect me to answer that?
- Fair enough.
- She was a big spender.
- But not with her friends.
When I needed a quid, the bitch refused to help me.
- She's dead!
- Good riddance.
- Her killer deserves a medal.
- We prefer a pair of handcuffs.
Cut it out!
- You...
You!
- Me?
Yes, you.
Come here.
Stop crying!
- What's your name?
- Giulia Spinelli.
She's done six months for robbing a customer.
- How old are you?
- 21.
You were closest to the deceased.
She fed me when I needed it.
- And taught you the trade.
- Pig!
You'd met that handsome guy who loved music, hadn't you?
I don't live here.
I hadn't seen her in months.
Surely a letter, a phone call..
There wasn't much to discuss with the kind of life we lead.
Quite a life!
Comfortable, too...
- If you don't tell the truth...
- But I have.
Very well.
See you later.
See you later.
- You keep away from me.
- Not again!
Forget her innocent face.
She's the biggest bitch around.
Goodbye, Inspector.
- Our star...
- Goodbye.
Let's go.
Cheer up.
I'm not through with you yet.
You know what 'pimp' means?
Ask him... or maybe not.
Listen to my theory first.
Natalina provided him with a great lifestyle.
He probably promised he'd marry her.
But then he meets you, a decent girl.
Wealthy, too.
But Natalina could spoil everything.
You'd never marry a pimp.
So he shut her mouth for good.
But why didn't you wait until the weekend?
You could have taken her somewhere out of sight.
You didn't have the time, eh?
She threatened to talk, so you did a rush job.
Then you took her jewels, to make it look like a robbery.
Where are they?
In the river?
You could turn a saint into a criminal.
The saint has spoken!
You have no compassion.
- Get me the judge.
- You see evil everywhere.
You have no right to treat him like this.
There are other men living in that building.
Get me Judge Marciano.
- You really love him, eh?
- Is that a crime too?
It's your business.
You may go, Miss.
Your father's outside.
- No time for farewells.
- Come on, Miss.
Judge Marciano, please.
It's Inspector Fioresi.
Yes, Your Honour.
She's only a girl, but...
Yes, I'm sure.
If you authorise me...
I'll hold him for a few days.
Okay, I'll keep you informed.
Good night.
Take him to the cells.
I'm not going to jail!
I'm not going!
Quiet!
It's all over now.
Have a good sleep and don't think about it.
Can we go now?
After you sign the record of interview.
The statements are ready.
Okay.
You know...
I had a young daughter, too.
She'd be exactly your age.
All based on that child's testimony...
Correct.
What if she lied?
You still think so, eh?
Do you really know what today's girls are like?
You should hear the jokes they tell.
Shall I tell you one?
Silvana isn't like that.
Well, she's cheeky enough to wear lipstick.
- Silvana?
- That's right.
Nice and innocent with her mother... but she paints her lips when out of her sight.
Imagine the defence counsel with a witness like that.
He'd destroy her in five minutes.
Who told you?
Her friends.
I summoned them.
I hope I did the right thing.
Does that mean I didn't?
Did you ever see this girl wearing lipstick?
Yes.
Once.
Okay then.
Put your belt back on and come with me.
Listen to me...
Hold it.
Did she tell you Gino came out of that door?
- Not me.
- Me neither.
- Why didn't you tell them?
- It was a secret.
- Don't you trust them?
- It was a secret.
Okay, it was a secret... but Silvana must have talked about Gino?
She kept mentioning him.
She said he had a musical soul.
What else?
That she'd walk over hot coals for him.
In exchange for a 50-seconder, though!
A what?
!
A 50-second-long kiss.
- Did you wear lipstick too?
- No, Mum, I swear.
Who came up with the 50 seconds business?
- Not me.
- It was Paola down at the...
Where?
Speak up.
You'll pay dearly for any lies.
- Where was it, Paola?
- She makes everything up.
Down at the park, timing couples kissing.
- You took me there.
- That's not true, Mum.
- What about you?
- No.
My daughter isn't even friends with her.
I told you not to mix with her.
- Some reputation!
- She's scared of her mother.
- Just as well.
- It's all about the family.
- Enough!
- Stop mincing words.
You mean to say Silvana is an habitual liar.
When it suits her.
To chat him up, she said his car had been broken into.
True.
- A lie, I presume.
- Yes, ask them.
Is that so?
You mean she made the whole thing up?
Speak up.
Don't play her game.
- That's right.
- She made it up.
Okay, you can go.
- We'll settle this at home.
- Your father will kill you.
Don't give our names to the press.
- Our reputation's are at stake.
- Go now.
Leave it to us.
- Thank God for this.
- Let me go.
- Your badge of honour...
- Let me go!
Come back here.
Go on, put it on.
Go on, show us what you look like.
So you feel ashamed now.
No one's taken me for a ride like you did.
He could have got 30 years.
No, I didn't...
No, Gino, I didn't...
I swear...
- Let me go!
- At least say you're sorry.
That's too easy a way out.
There are jails for people your age too, you know.
You're better off telling the truth.
- Stop playing games.
- Are you feeling ill?
- Did you make it all up?
- Water...
Admit you made it all up!
Otherwise, forget about going home.
Yes...
She's really ill, the poor thing.
- Take her away.
- Come on, don't be like that.
Stop crying.
- So... you're free.
- Thanks.
Well, your coming forward paid off in the end.
Luckily I got to deal with a man like you.
There should be more...
I thought I had my cigarettes.
Collect your personal belongings outside.
Thanks.
It all worked out fine, eh?
Don't be too harsh on us with the journalists.
I thought all along you were a decent character.
- Thanks.
- Go now.
There you are...
Here.
You can go, madam.
Madam...
Try and keep an eye on her.
Another day down the drain...
You were right.
She's coming.
Get ready, boys...
Ready, ready, ready...
It's all your fault...
She knows all about you.
She's in love.
- Who with?
- With you, of course.
Are you angry?
I kissed you because I'm fond of you.
Clean?
Her?
Pull the other one!
Don't be influenced by her age or her saintly looks.
No one's taken me for a ride like you did.
He could have got 30 years.
Don't you give a damn about your mother?
You do something like this, but not a word to her.
Instead, you write to that guy.
Were you frank, at least?
I thought he deserved a bit of trouble.
Not too much.
- What a character!
- I'm the way I am.
Don't get up.
You should rest.
I'm bored.
Are my shoes over there?
Deep down, you're a good girl.
Now I'm being frank, too.
But isn't it a bit too early to start wearing lipstick?
Come here.
I'll take your note to Gino.
I'll tell him you did this because you were sorry.
Bye.
- I bet you won't tell him.
- Don't you trust me?
Nobody trusts the police.
Are you sure you won't do him more harm?
Sorry for waking you so early.
I came as soon as I could.
How is she?
How is she?
Let's say she's still alive.
Don't worry; she's fine.
Nobody can understand.
My life hasn't been easy.
- Was she in pain?
- A bit.
Did she ask for me?
I guess she didn't.
Hi.
Hello, Inspector.
You can't escape your job.
If you don't mind, I should be going now.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
I know.
I'd like a word with you.
I can give you my best wishes.
I'll leave my bomb here.
I'll say hello to your fiancée.
I have to ask her a couple of quick questions.
Can't you put it off till another day?
Until you're back from your honeymoon?
Be careful!
What's wrong?
Are you edgy?
Why should I be?
You act on impulse.
I've worked you out.
Your mistake in accusing the girl, for instance...
I guess you did it to cover your back.
But you blew it.
After all, I got it wrong too.
I let a witness slip through my hands because of some lipstick.
How about giving me a break?
Take it easy.
Why are they following us?
Keep driving.
- The Inspector to see you.
- What is it?
- I won't bother you.
Is your father in?
- No.
Where can we talk in private?
Cinzia, phone Cloe.
Tell her to hurry up.
Over there.
They haven't delivered my wedding dress yet.
"Dear Gino, I'm dying...
"No one will cry for me when I'm gone.
"You won't care either.
I know.
"I just wanted to say I never suspected you...
"when I saw you come out of that door.
"But I did many foolish things, and I apologise.
"It was because I loved you."
After writing this, she tried to slit her wrists.
- A 13-year-old girl.
- A liar!
A mythomaniac, fair enough...
However, Silvana is asking for your forgiveness.
She's saying sorry for causing you trouble.
Doesn't that make you think?
Seeing him come out of that door didn't mean he was a killer.
To Silvana, it was simply jealousy.
- She really did see you come out of that door.
- No!
Try and convince that girl that he's a murderer...
But you're not a girl.
You have no right to victimise me.
Today I can't arrest you.
Perhaps tomorrow, or in a week.
We'll re-open the case, based on circumstantial evidence.
Didn't you ever wonder why he wouldn't invite you over... when the landladies were away?
Because Natalina was there...
while she was still alive.
- Greci...
- Go in now.
Otello Greci.
He owns a restaurant.
Gino worked there, playing the guitar.
Why did you fire him?
- It was my daughter...
- Go on.
- The whole story?
- Go on.
My daughter was only 16.
Then this guy...
Didn't he offer to marry her?
- And her dowry?
- Eight million.
That's what he was after.
So I kicked him out.
Margherita...
Come here, Margherita.
Come on...
Don't be afraid.
Come on.
Take her home.
And now you can marry him, if you so wish.
Darling...
Darling, it's not true.
I'll explain everything.
I can explain everything.
Listen to me.
Don't abandon me, I beg you.
If you confess now, it'll help your case.
No!
I love you.
I swear, I love you.
I know it isn't easy.
I don't want to lose you!
I don't want to lose you.
Lorella!
It's too late now.
Tough luck.
- It can't be true...
- Yes?
This isn't happening.
- I didn't mean to...
- Now that's better...

Hey, guys!
It's Zagora!
We've arrived.
Pass me the tools!
Comrades!
Who is making for Zagora, get down!
Come on.
Throw me the bags!
A story I'm going to tell you
I heard from my mother.
She told it to me a few times, but many details have been effaced from my memory.
I will narrate it as I remember.
It was the year 1918.
All the world with bated breath listened to the bellow of the cannons of our young Revolution.
There was a struggle for life and death.
That very year when all the county, it seemed, thought only of war
Lenin decided to begin construction of several power plants.
One of them was being built near the village that I would name Zagora.
People were arriving here from everywhere.
They were fathers, wives and brothers of them who desperately fought with the enemy at the front.
They were half-starved, barefooted, and they came here to give the country electricity.
There were no places to live in, so they settled in dugouts and found lodgings in nearby villages.
- Mother, let me in.
- I have seven lodgers already.
No place.
- Hey, would you let me in?
- What you pay with?
- Money, of course.
- No way.
Money won't do.
Money won't do.
It was from these days my mother usually started her story.
What are you banging?
Look, would you let me in?
- My house is full already.
- I'll pay with sugar.
You're lying, eh?
Here it is.
Well, come in.
Come in.
You settle in here.
- Hi.
- Hello!
Anyuta...
- Look.
- Jesus!
Hey, soldier...
Well, join.
Since you'll live here, you'll give me all your ration.
If you're hungry, sit down to table.
Anyuta, give him a spoon.
Well, no.
Cheers!
God save us!
Hey, lame leg, where are you from?
The front?
Yes.
Is it true that generals forced Kharkov?
- I haven't heard of it.
- They did.
Really!
- Now they march to Moscow.
- Why are you so glad?
You wanted to sign up with the Communists, eh.
Maybe I'll do it yet.
Not all at once!
Am I right, Anyuta?
- Keep your grabbers to yourself!
- Why?
They'll hang you anyway.
- What for?
- You know not?
- Did you sack manor-houses?
- He did.
- Everybody did.
- They will hang everybody too.
- There's no lack of trees.
- That's true.
Am I right, soldier?
- Do you have money?
Have a drink.
- No, I don't want.
- As you like.
- Pour me some.
To keep your company!
- Strong wine!
Where did you take it?
- God sent it.
God sent him against Devil, and swapped Him for moonshine.
Hold you tongue or I'll cut it off.
Oh, what a people!
The war is on, and you are filling your bellies.
- The shameless ones!
- What do you want?
Wait!
Who has no conscience?
Do I have no conscience?
Do they have it?
They closed churches – no burial services, no baptisms.
No place for a man to pray, people live with no thread on.
You'll plunder everything in no time.
Who are you?
Who are you by the way?
So much used to carry on agitation!
Get him out!
Hey, you!
What is your...
Denis.
That's no way to offend people.
Come on!
Give him a good licking.
- Don't meddle, Fedor.
- Why does he offend people?
Well, be quiet.
There's not much time left for them.
- God sees everything.
Goddamn it!
- It's true.
To hell with them!
Tell them we are full.
- We are full.
- Are there Communists there?
- Who?
- Are there Communists?
- Communists...
- What Communists?
No Communists!
- No, no!
None of them!
- Wait!
- I am a Communist.
- Come to the meeting.
- Your name?
- Gubanov.
What are you by profession?
I am a metalworker, and can work as a carpenter,
- digger.
I can do all.
- Do you know scales?
- What scales?
- Can you weigh on the scales?
Why should I?
I am a worker, not a weigher.
As you are a worker, you will be in charge of the warehouse.
Right!
No, no way!
I shed my blood not for weighing out herring!
Are you kidding?
Your Party-membership card.
How do you like it!
He shed blood!
We should bow down to him now.
And we are just idling here, aren't we?
Give him back his card, if he doesn't want to.
Take it.
- How long are you waiting?
- Two hours.
- Wait!
Carry it back.
- Why?
I say, carry it back.
Put it down.
Go out.
Hey, dear citizen, why do you order about here?
Yakov Ivanovich!
You, dear citizen, go out please.
Oh, flatmate!
How do you do?
What do you want?
Listen to me, comrade!
I'm talking to you.
It's no admittance here.
Do you have the keys?
- What's the matter?
- Hand me the keys.
Unbolt the door and call for people!
Wait!
Step aside from the door.
There's my credentials.
I see.
Wait.
Why do you offend me?
You have no fear of God.
It's all the lie.
Stepan said a pack of lies of me.
Saint icon!
Saint icon?
- And what is these?
- It's samples.
Well, be off!
And take care that I will not see or hear of you anymore!
Who knows?
Maybe we'll run across each other some day?
- Well, who came for what?
- Windowpanes!
..
Wait, comrades!
Order for nails.
Nails?
Wait.
Hurry up!
We can't stand here all the day.
- Hey, guys, still waiting?
- We are.
It is the third day we came after nails.
You won't get your nails this way!
You'd better go from the back yard,
- with moonshine.
- Indeed!
Lenin is sending building materials here and they carry it over to the market.
Profiteers!
Why are you banging?
Look at him!
- No nails, comrades.
- And where are they?
We put life in out work, and you...
- Bring nails!
- I said no nails.
No nails?
An how did they get lost?
- What are you looking?
Thief!
- Be quiet there!
Why should I be quiet?
I fear you not!
You are a thief and that mug of yours is that of a bandit!
I spit upon you!
Hey, guys, take it easy!
This storekeeper is just appointed.
Why do you keep silent, you fool?
It won't do.
It's bad.
- Who is here for drying oil?
- It's me.
And I wait for whiting.
O, Jesus.
Anyuta, did you hear what the black-bearded one said?
Lenin flew from Petrograd...
- Maybe he's telling lies...
- Well, if it's true... then it's bad news.
I'd better take out that cotton fabric and bury it in the shed.
It'll make my mind easy.
What do you think?
I don't know, Fedor.
You know better.
Oh, Mother of God, my brains are splitting.
We got ourselves into this mess, the world revolution...
Well, I'd better bury the fabric in the shed.
Is he asleep?
- He's reading.
- Damn him!
Well, you get up and have an eye on him.
- Is the spade in the shed?
- Yes.
You know, dear comrade, you should pay me for burning oil.
- The oil is not cheep nowadays.
- I'll give you money for oil.
Why don't you sleep, mistress?
I need something to do.
What are you reading?
This book is "The Communist Manifesto".
- And are you not afraid?
- Afraid of what?
That you are a Communist.
The Whites will come and kill you.
If you're afraid of death you can change nothing in your life.
It's queer.
- Where are you going?
- Why?
I want to take my tobacco.
What's wrong?
Don't you feel bored here?
You might work at the construction.
It's quite near.
They are in need of people.
Why should I go away from my house?
- There's our farm.
- Your farm!
You get rusty, but look what a big thing people are doing!
- Many women are working too.
- Women?
We know of it.
It's all fooling about.
And what do you busy yourself with?
Myself?
Well, different activities.
Tomorrow I go to Moscow to provide the construction with supplies.
And Denis will accompany me.
I have much business in hand.
Well, all right.
Put out the light and go to sleep.
Much time spent Vasily and Denis in Moscow.
They visited many warehouses and organizations.
They procured bar iron, spades, wire, axes, only there were no nails.
Hey, friend, let us walk in.
- Do you have a pass?
- If we had, there'd be no problem.
- No pass, no passage.
- Wait.
Hold it.
Listen to me.
We came from Zagora.
Surely, you heard about it.
- Well...
- We're building a power station.
We need supplies.
That's what we're here for.
- Our chief is here in session.
- We have got all but nails.
- So we came here for nails.
- For nails?
It's the Kremlin, it's the government.
Them come here to solve affairs of state.
- And what's that of yours?
- What's that of ours?
- People do need nails!
- It's no use talking about it.
Produce your pass.
Listen.
These nails, we seek after them from dawn, no rest, no eating - but still no nails!
- Well...
- And you standing here like a fool.
- Produce your pass.
- Wait, Denis.
You consider it carefully, friend.
Time is wasting.
The project can end stopped, and you're standing here like a stuffed dummy.
But are a Red Guard, proletarian blood!
Now we're here and tomorrow we may shed blood together.
- Produce your pass.
- You and your harping about the pass!
Are you going to enter the world revolution with a pass too?
Where's your class consciousness?
Let's go!
- Stop!
Or I shall shoot!
- Well, shoot, you bastard!
Why do you stare at me?
Shoot!
- What's the matter?
- They want to trespass.
We're from Zagora, carrying out a pressing mission.
- And this one!
- Wait.
So, you're from Zagora?
- And your chief is Zimny, isn't he?
- He is.
Well, go with me.
Let them in.
Listen, keep watch over my bag.
Especially because you've got a rifle.
Is Comrade Zimny at the committee meeting?
- Zimny?
Yes, he is.
- These comrades came from Zagora...
Sit down, please.
I'll call you when there's a break.
We are to create a net of power stations and according to plan they should cover all country - the European part, Siberia, Urals and Turkestan...
Using it as a support we can build up all the industry.
Let's take the Donbas, for example.
Shterovskaya is project number one.
Comrade Zimny, they came to you.
What're you doing here?
We're looking for you, Comrade Zimny.
No nails still.
You go.
I'll come soon.
- What's matter here?
- Sorry, Vladimir Ilyich.
They came from Zagora.
From Zagora?
Excuse me, Gleb Maximilyanovich!
And what happened there?
The supply has come short, Vladimir Ilyich.
- There's something we can't get.
- And what in particular?
We're short of nails, Vladimir Ilyich.
There's always tumult at my warehouse.
They demand nails.
- You must go to Metal Sales Depot.
- I've been everywhere.
No nails.
- Have you tried Sokolovsky?
- That's idea!
- Why, I haven't.
- And you said you tried everywhere!
Sorry.
Wait, Comrade!
First we'll know whether he has got nails.
You see I've got everything but nails!
Hello, Comrade Sokolovsky!
Lenin speaking.
We need nails for Zagora.
No nails?
We need them very desperately!
Not a single nail?
You think Vareitis has it?
All right, we'll call Vareitis.
4-36-77
Comrade Vareitis?
Lenin speaking.
Do you have nails?
Yes, nails.
Vladimir Ilyich, you tell them that we can barter it for drying oil.
We can barter it for drying oil.
Zagora is one of the most important state projects as well.
So you do have it after all?
You see?
You push and you get!
Vladimir Ilyich, if we could have get a little of screws...
There is a Comrade...
What is your name?
- Gubanov.
- Vasily Gubanov.
Gubanov will visit you and you please get on with it.
And as for screws – you push him yourself!
- He's yielding.
- I'll push.
Thank you, Vladimir Ilyich.
What number is the Zagora project on your list?
No.16, Vladimir Ilyich.
No. 1, 2, 3 are still in our dreams, but No. 16 is becoming a reality.
They' re asking for nails.
What about food in Zagora, comrades?
Not good, I presume.
Sorry.
Did I snore?
No, no.
Got tired during the war, mistress.
Am always sleepy.
Denis, cheer, brother!
We've found nails.
Lenin has helped.
Comrades!
Be quiet.
Sorry.
They are sending you to provide food.
Wait.
They must write out an order first.
- Is it a long journey?
- To Ukraine.
- What?
- Ukraine.
Holy Mother!
How do you do?
And where is everybody?
Nobody is here.
- My husband is away.
- Why so?
For how long?
He went to buy flour and maybe some lard.
Great!
But where are all the rest?
- He told them to move.
- Why?
They shouldn't spend the nights here in his absence.
I see.
You seemed to have moved too, but your things are still here.
I was making a business trip.
I've just driven a goods train from Moscow.
We have unloaded it and I came here.
Did you think about me?
Well, you think no small beer of yourself!
Well, and I did think about you.
I've got presents for you.
It's some tobacco for Fedor and a kerchief for you.
Try it on.
Beautiful.
Anyuta, where are my things?
Under the bench.
- Wanna anything to eat?
- Nope.
I've got bread.
What are you looking?
- Your wife?
- No.
- Fiancee?
- A kind of.
Does she love you?
We just only kissed once when life was smooth.
Then I went to the front and she stopped writing.
Love can't be like this.
Maybe you were worth little in her eyes.
Maybe.
Love is such a thing.
A powerful thing.
Anyuta, what's up with you?
Go away!
Do you hear?
Fedor ordered that nobody could stay here.
Go away!
Well...
As you say.
My salute to Communists!
- What do you want?
- I forgot my towel.
What towel?
Where is it?
There is no towel of yours here.
Well, never mind.
Let us just sit and talk.
- So you came back?
- I did.
Where are you going to live?
- None of your busyness.
- It's my business because you can't stay here.
Is it clear?
- Fedor is giving no permit.
- And what are you doing here?
Me?
I'm looking for my towel.
All right.
I agree to draw lots.
Let the cards say.
Come on, draw your card.
- What is it?
- You just draw.
Mind!
I stake it on red.
Well, get out of here!
But why?
Draw.
- Do you hear what I said?
- Enough playing commissar here!
- Small potatoes you are here!
- Go out!
Now I see.
That's why the world revolution was needed for.
That's where your Karl Marx is hiding now!
Well, you go first then.
I am not proud.
I can be second.
What are you doing?
Bastard!
You look so tough in your military uniform!
Some day I'll talk tough too.
Goodbye, Anyuta.
Close the door after me.
Cotton fabric from Sarepta!
Cotton fabric!
Only a remnant left.
Come and buy!
- What is it?
- It's like calico, only better.
- I printed it myself.
- It's a rag.
Dear citizen, how can it be a rag?
God forbid!
It's very durable.
Look!
- Two ponds.
- Five.
- Two.
- Five.
Brothers!
The Whites on the Sadovaya street!
Whip up!
Whip up!
- Four and a half.
- Two pounds.
- Three.
- Four.
- Three.
- Add a half more.
Our village has burnt down.
Wait!
Take it!
Take it.
I am ruined now.
Now I'll have to starve.
What a cheater!
Comrades!
Great trials befell the working class.
The Whites were advancing from all sides.
All cannons of the world, it seemed, were aimed at Moscow.
But thousands of workers went to defend their Republic.
There were so many fronts that it was hard to count them all.
But those who rose to fight the enemy were countless.
Zagora men went to war too.
You, married woman!
Who you're looking for?
Vasily?
It's she.
Look at her!
Such a whore!
Every night pleasing the storekeeper.
- Look at her!
- What?
Have you no fear of God?
God is with me.
Who is with you, storekeeper's catch?
Running away, eh?
Boys!
Go after her just to change front!
- She will turn nobody down!
- Stop clowning about!
- What is there to you?
- Enough, I said.
That very day Anyuta left her village.
She had neither kinsfolk nor relatives.
She had look for a job and she came to the construction plant.
There Vasily and Anyuta were brought together again.
Saving nails is not a jest
You are a host here, not a guest
- Is it you who wrote it?
- It's not bad, is it?
- When will the bricks arrive?
- At the end of the month.
Are we going to stop the project then?
- I don't know.
- Comrade Gubanov!
Order for spades.
Vasily, I came for nails.
Nails?
I can give you only half as much.
- But it is half as much!
- Then it should be a 1/4 as much!
- Did you see that?
- It's all poetry.
Here is the invoice.
Come with me.
- What about slaked lime here?
- Lime?
- Over there.
- Wait.
- What about slaked lime here?
- Ask him.
Anyuta!
Why are you here?
- Me?
I'm working now.
- Where?
At the construction.
Here is the invoice for lame.
Are you going to supply it or not?
One minute.
- Do we have lime?
- We do.
Take it up.
- Where do you live?
- In a barrack.
- In what barrack?
- In an ordinary one.
- Is it far from here?
- Why?
Well, we're sort of acquainted.
Acquainted?
There's nothing between us.
Wait, Anyuta!
Sign your name.
I am uneducated.
Put down a cross.
You should go to school.
Really.
Can I get my lime?
Yes.
Even many years later Denis liked to recollect how he carried food products for Zagora.
He starved but was firmly resolved to deliver the precious load safe and sound.
The state property, brothers!
I can't let you in.
Help me with my bags!
Hey, you, help!
Can someone help me?
Jesus!
Fedor!
- Oh, my God!
Denis?
- Where're you from?
I went to barter my cotton fabric for food.
- Give me a leg up!
- Come on.
It's the fifth change already.
What are you doing here?
I convoy goods cars to Zagora.
It's more than a month I'm travelling by rail.
Starved like a hell.
I even swapped my tunic for bread.
- Yes.
That's bad.
- Can't be worse.
It looks, the train's starting off.
They say things look very bad.
The Whites are quite near.
I saw them with my eyes!
Generals are close on the heels.
That's real bad.
What you've got there?
I've got everything now.
These supplies will last us for a whole winter.
There's flour, cereals, sugar.
And lard too.
I haven't eaten lard for ages.
- What about a piece of bread too?
- It's possible.
But how can you pay off?
- Pay off?
- It costs some money by the way.
- I haven't a penny.
- Not a penny?
But I cannot give food for nothing, you must understand.
I've been buying the lard under the bullets.
It was a hell of a shooting.
Aren't your shoes worn out, eh?
Why should they be?
I wear them but for a year.
It looks like longer than a year.
Well, agreed!
I change them for lard.
It was quite often that my mother told me how these people lived.
Everyone had his own thoughts, sorrows and joys, dreams and fates.
But together they were one country -
Russia which overturned the old world.
I would listen to this story and I would see that all that great progress going on around us was achieved by their labor,
by their sacrifice.
We are not slaves.
No boyars we are.
- Is Zimny here?
- No.
What are you doing here?
It's campaign against illiteracy.
Oh, that's a good thing.
Well, dear students, the point is that there is a trainload of brick. 40 trucks.
- It must be unloaded.
- Another subbotnik?
- You've guessed right!
- At night?
- It's not our concern.
- How can it be?
Quite simple.
Because it's not ours.
I am a carpenter.
A skilled craftsman.
You should engage unskilled laborers to unload trucks, not me.
Here's a learned person.
Look at him!
Not his concern.
Do you think Lenin is less learned than you?
I haven't measured myself against him.
I'll tell you without any measuring.
He's not as silly as you.
Lenin says that people have to do with everything - to fight generals and build a power station.
Equally we'll have to buy this woman a new blouse.
Everything is our concern now.
Am I right?
- It seems so.
- Well, if so go to your barracks and call people for subbotnik in the name of the Revolution!
Girls.
Wake up.
There's brick brought.
They're calling for subbotnik.
Well, subbotnik, girls.
They're calling all hands to help.
Who's calling?
Every day all the same.
They say it's in the name of the Revolution.
Hey, aboard the trucks!
Stand in pairs along all the chain!
- Where should we go?
- One minute.
Comrade Gubanov, nobody is unloading the first truck.
- There will be ones.
- Anyuta?
Are you here too?
- Good for you.
- Where should we stand?
Go to the third truck.
Let's go.
If you want to really cheer people up
- call for an accordionist.
- That's right!
Hey, play the accordion!
Come on!
How are you?
Can I help you?
We aren't behindhand, are we.
Hey, master of ceremonies, why are you idling?
Start working!
- Stand here.
- Take it.
Anyuta, why are you dropping your eyes?
- Are you angry with me?
- Don't I just!
Am I to be so glad because you disgraced me?
Who disgraced you?
- Who disgraced you?
- You know better.
I left my home because of you.
What?
Why?
I don't understand a thing.
Have you fallen asleep or what?
Well, we'll talk later.
Stepan?
You just wait, son of a bitch!
And you?
How could you believe that I could say such a thing?
I don't know whom I can believe now!
Look me in the face if you don't know!
- Let go!
- Do you want to know the truth?
All you just waiting to try it on!
It looks like Stepan has no right to, but you do.
Don't touch me!
I'm married.
Well, I understand that you are married and that there's the Revolution... but I can't myself.
I'm not like myself.
I am not just for going with you, silly woman!
I love you!
- Don't touch me!
- I love you.
It's a sin.
Wait!
I'll be waiting here tomorrow night when the moon is out.
When the moon is out!
Where're you going?
- To my village.
- At night?
What for?
Fedor may have come back.
Come in.
Why are you so early?
I need to talk.
Well, talk.
Tell me, please, how are we going to deal with love under Communism?
- Will it exist or not?
- What a question!
That's why you get up at dawn?
Go and get some more sleep.
Love will exist.
But supposing a woman is married, and you fall in love with her, and you want to lure her away to live with her...
Does it accord with Communism or not?
It's a problem.
The Marxist theory provides no answer to it.
But since you bring up this topic I'd say thus - it's no good to have an affair with a married woman.
- You must restrain yourself.
- But what if I can't?
!
if it's burning inside me day and night?
!
Well, what communists are we then if we can't hold our whims in check?
- Go and fall in love with any girl!
- I don't need any girl.
Love does not care whether she is married or not.
It's burning inside me!
Grey is the theory which says nothing of it.
- Wait.
- I think of her constantly - where is she?
why didn't she come?
Tell me, Marxist, what is all this?
Frosya,
tell them that I quit our gang.
Why?
I go to work at the peatery.
Are you crazy?
No, I should go.
And if he... that storekeeper asks about me
you tell him you know nothing.
You know nothing at all.
You know I'm not against love.
But you're a Communist.
An example to other people.
You're a touchstone showing whether it's truth or filth that we bring into this world.
And if we start luring wives away from their husbands will it be good?
What will people tell about us?
That the Party went crazy?
Is it time to fall for it?
The working class is fighting a historical battle, and what a fighter you are if you keep riving your heart?
Worthless you are as a fighter!
All right!
Enough!
I shall tear this fantasy out of my heart!
It is mistimed for us to play guitars and kiss girls.
Will you have tea?
Get up!
Lenin is killed!
Moscow!
Moscow!
Is he really killed?
Is it true?
Your run and ask!
It's a Moscow train.
- Why standing like a stone image?
- But my bags.
- Run by yourself.
- I can't leave my wagons
- but I'll watch over your bags.
- Like hell you will.
Hey, good man!
Listen, I can't leave my wagons, please, come back and tell me about Lenin.
Is it true?
- I'll go, only you look after them!
- Run!
Citizens!
Don't believe detractors!
Lenin is alive!
He is only wounded.
He's alive!
Comrades!
Enemy wanted to kill the one who is giving all his life to the working class!
They want to drown our freedom in blood!
They'll fail, Comrades!
Lenin is only wounded, he is alive!
He's alive!
Alive!
What a joy!
Jesus, I thought he was really killed.
He's such a man!
And I got so frightened.
- Would you eat to celebrate it?
- I'd rather.
Such a man.
Just think how much he did for people!
It's hard to imagine.
Lard or what?
I don't even know what to take off.
I only have my breeches left.
- Sort of shameful.
- It's not a church fete today.
We'll be home soon, too.
Come on.
Agreed.
Oh, my God...
- Stepan?
- Ah, you came back?
Anyuta!
Tell me, where's my wife?
Where's Anyuta?
- How do I know?
- And what are you doing here?
Me?
First I went to the front.
Then nice people said there's no point to hang your guts on a fence.
So I came back.
There's nowhere to live so I stay at your place.
I don't bother about you!
I'm asking you where is my wife?
Ease off!
Your wife?
She's at the construction.
Why at the construction?
I provided her with food.
He doesn't care a straw about your food.
She lives with a big boss now.
- What boss?
- Well...
Remember that lodger, a Communist?
It's him she reads Karl Marx with by nights.
You're lying, dog!
Why should I?
You ask people.
- Cross yourself!
- See?
Good Lord!
What do you punish me for?
Why is it so, Stepan?
I loved her so dearly.
Look, what sufferings have I borne!
I was being shot at, I endured, but still I carried food.
- She's my be-all and end-all.
- That is why she is like this!
Them girls need a good thrashing.
Well, wait you now, Anyuta.
I put the end to it.
I'll kill her.
Right!
You speak reason.
Here.
Are you crazy?
I've got my own means.
Where are the reins?
You are a fool as I can see.
Can you restrain a woman just with reins?
Help me, Stepan.
- Help, Stepan.
- Well, it's possible.
We'll go and take her away after dark.
And now you kindle the samovar!
Peter!
Hey, chaps!
Semyon!
- Oh!
They're girls, it seems!
- A man!
- Catch him!
- Wait!
- Take him!
- What do you want?
Look, he has stripped down to his underwear already!
You, silly women!
I thought it's a men's barrack!
- Oh, you lecher!
- I didn't even think of it!
What're you doing here?
You've got no shame!
I have brought food products here!
- What?
- I've brought food for you.
Well, cover yourself with it.
- Thank you.
- You just tell the truth!
I may cross myself, it's true!
I've brought sugar, millet and fruit-drops for your kids, and smoked lard...
Two wagons of the stuff at the station!
Girls!
And we nearly killed him!
Oh, my darling!
What are you...
Toss the hero!
- Frosya, dance with me!
- Go off!
- Have you seen Khromchenko?
- No.
- Have you seen Khromchenko?
- No.
- And Gubanov?
- No.
- Vitya!
Have you seen Gubanov?
- He's distributing presents.
- Is Gubanov here?
- He is.
- Come out for a minute!
- Moment.
Girls came from the peatery and said Anyuta was beaten by her husband.
- What?
- He may beat her to death, you know.
- Where it happened?
- At the peatery.
Two men tied her up and carted her home, to the Gordeevka village!
What are you telling me!
I was close enough to see them!
I'm here and they're there!
Wait!
But who they were?
Our people or Frenchmen?
Dog knows!
I ran away from there.
- Do they have cavalry?
- Yes.
- And artillery?
- But for it I would never run!
I've seen everything.
I was bartering my fabric everywhere.
I've brought so much food...
Eat!
Eat it all!
That's the end.
I'll kill her anyway!
Are you sleeping, Anyuta?
What have you done?
What can we do now?
All life came to nothing.
Anyuta, maybe they are lying?
Wicked tongues them are, you know.
Let me untie you now.
Anyuta, do you hear me?
Maybe it's all lies.
Maybe you've yielded to him but you don't love him?
Tell me that you don't love him.
I pray.
I love him.
Come on.
Have a drink!
Sit down!
Drink!
Anyuta!
Anyuta!
You?
You!
Where have you been?
Why haven't you been looking for me?
Why haven't you called me?
Or you don't love me anymore,
- do you?
- I love you!
I love you!
I long for you.
I can't live without you.
My beloved!
Let them beat me!
Let him kill me!
My dear!
So it sealed their fate.
They were my mother and father.
A year passed by.
I think it was the hardest times for our country.
The Whites were advancing towards Moscow.
Denikin's mounted patrols were scouring about near Tula.
Our armies were short of rifles and ammunition.
Population badly needed fuel and clothing.
Then there was no bread.
No bread
How are we going to solve these problems, Communists?
- We must find a solution.
- Right.
What solution it can be?
No trains, no communication with Moscow!
There's no bread.
There's nothing!
- And at the fronts?
- At the fronts?
They are starving too.
What is more, they are shedding their blood!
Hunger and devastation are all over the country.
Ours is the only place where construction continues.
Here.
It's the only light in the darkness.
Can we let it die out?
Ivan Andreevich, it's typhus all around.
They drop like flies.
Typhus is not we are afraid of.
It's no big deal.
How do we live without bread?
Where is flour?
- Why do you keep silent?
- What can I say?
I already told you.
A train with flour was sent from Moscow, but no one saw it yet.
- Where is it?
- How do I know?
Got stuck somewhere.
A bridge is blown up or something else.
Sorry, Comrades, I am ill.
Well, then, Comrades!
There are 16 communists here.
The Party commissioned us to build this project and we'll do everything we can for its realization.
First we need communication with Moscow.
It's your task, Comrade Andreev.
Kashin, Soloviev and Vikentiev, you'll go around the villages and look where we can get some grain.
- We got it.
- Any amount of it, if only it suffices to last one day.
And remember:
it's your Party mission.
Vasily, you have to set out in search of the train.
You must drive it here at all costs!
- I see.
Can I go?
- Go!
Why?
Don't you recognize me?
We haven't seen each other for a year.
It seems so.
Still building it?
Still.
In spite of typhus and hunger?
- And for how long yet?
- Until it's ready.
It's queer.
Take it.
No need.
It's not for you.
It's for somebody.
I said no.
Well, we'll have got more then.
Listen!
You tell your bosses to be careful there,
- otherwise...
- What otherwise?
- Who should be careful?
- You, Communists.
- I heard the rumors...
- Enough.
Enough of your cackling here.
And be off with you!
Well, do as you think fit.
They say she gave birth, didn't she?
Yes.
The day before yesterday.
We have a son.
Mitya!
Call Denis!
Anyuta!
My dear!
Take care of yourself and know that if affairs are in a bad way
I, too, can't live without you.
People are building a new life, and so we are as well.
Don't cry.
I've brought you a gift from Vasily.
Is anybody in?
Who is the engine driver?
What's your station of destination?
Zagora?
- Is it Zagora, I'm asking you?
- Well, Zagora.
What's the problem?
Are you committing sabotage here?
- Why has the train stopped?
- There's no firewood.
And the bridge was blown up.
No firewood?
It's all forest around!
We do not need forest, we need firewood.
- Only then we'll go on.
- Why, couldn't you chop it?
People in Zagora are starving to death, and you're sleeping here, bastards!
Get up!
- Are you a local?
- Say, yes.
Go and fetch axes and saws in no time.
- Where can I get them?
- Wherever you like!
There's an axe and a saw under the bed.
Take it if you want.
You must be shot, sons of a bitch!
A contused one.
Hey, you, dear man!
Do you know how much wood we need to get to Zagora?
- You've to fell trees for five days!
- I'll do it for five days.
Go and get more sleep, you sponger!
Well, do it, do it!
- Is he cutting it down by himself?
- Yes.
Stop making a fool of yourself!
You can't handle it all alone.
Have a rest and eat something.
- Where can we get more axes?
- Dog knows!
Maybe we can ask in the nearby hamlets?
- Boys, run and ask.
- Come on, Peter!
Let me, odd fellow!
That'll do!
End of work, boys!
Hey!
We'll finish it tomorrow morning.
I won't go!
Are you going to work all the night?
- I shall!
- You'll die.
People need bread.
Can you understand it?
Bread!
Or there'll be no Zagora anymore!
That obstinate devil.
There's a forest over there.
There's the power station over there.
Your Mum is working there and your Dad too.
Look, what a big girl!
You shall be as big soon.
Look, what a doggie!
And there's a smoke...
Smoke!
Look, girls, it's a smoke!
- Where?
- Fire!
Hey, chap, it looks like it's a fire over there.
It's Zagora!
Zagora is on fire!
Lead the horse here!
Why are you so slow!
Come here!
Take your stand here!
Knock down padlocks!
- Quicker, boys!
- You go down!
Tie him!
Load the carts with sacks!
Yakov Ivanovich!
- We've caught him!
- Hello, gentle dove.
I promised you that we'll meet one day.
What fools we were!
We should have shot you long ago!
Shut up, you infidel!
Look in that direction!
- Hold him tight!
- Do you like it?
- Where is your chief?
- Look at the power station!
- Where is your chief?
- Bring up the cart here!
Where is your chief?
- Where's your chief?
- What is it?
- They're robbing the train!
- What train?
Wait!
What train?
What train?
No trains are running now.
Sure it cannot be the goods train with grain!
Girls!
My Vasily should be there.
Stop him!
He'll escape!
Go aside!
I am shooting!
You bandit!
I'll kill you!
Come here all!
Check him!
He'll escape!
Put it down!
Wait, boys!
Let me!
Let me do it!
Step aside!
Let me speak with the bastard!
Step aside!
Hold him!
Hold him!
- How many barracks survived?
– Nos. 15, 16, partially...
We'll have to live in dugouts again.
Alexander Vasilievich, Moscow on the line.
Moscow?
Hello!
Vladimir Ilyich is going to speak with you.
Hello, Comrade Zimny.
What happened over there?
Fire?
Yes, there was a fire.
It looks like it was an arson, Vladimir Ilyich.
Well, it's nothing really.
Only a few barrack burnt down and a part of stored peat.
Well, I see.
You are going to set me at rest.
Don't do it and tell me all the truth.
Itemize what you have lost.
I see...
And what about people?
Do they quit you?
No, Vladimir Ilyich, they keep staying.
They all are here!
That's good.
That is very important!
What about victims?
Not much, no severe accidents, burns and wounds mostly.
But one man was killed.
Gubanov.
He was a Communist.
Do you remember him?
Gubanov?
Gubanov!
I don't know him.
Once you helped him to procure nails.
A young man he was.
Do you remember?
Yes.
Well, we're losing people.
Good people.
Well, so it is that economy is a front too.
Capitalists know too well that every technological success of ours is an offensive on them!
It is a struggle!
It is a struggle!
And victims are inevitable.
But the price we are paying, it clearly shows people's determination to reach the goal!
At any cost!
And it means that they have believed in the goal.
They have faith in the Party.
That's why we are winning.
If Comrade Gubanov is married you take care of his family, Alexander Vasilievich!
Dear friends!
Today we are making our farewells to Vasily Gubanov, our dear and loved friend.
Where does he come from, this man?
He comes of a worker's family.
He was twelve when he went to work at a factory.
Then there were the Revolution and the Civil War...
- What about the murderers?
- A tribunal is coming from Moscow.
I'd not judge them but skin them alive!
They say he left a wife with a baby.
There she is.
Neither ranks nor rations he was waiting from the Party.
He was seeking only truth in it, and this truth he was fighting for.
He was so strong and so full of life that, it seemed, no death could break him.
Now we swear, dear Comrade, that we shall obtain this truth so as to achieve your beautiful dream.
Let me speak!
I'm an outsider here.
I'm the engine driver from that goods train...
I do not know anybody of you and I did not know this man here.
But I saw how he chopped wood how he thought of people...
What if we all were like him and always like him!
..
Farewell, brother!
- Oh, take the baby!
- Give it to me!
- Well, where is the band?
- It's a pity but all the instruments have perished in the fire.
Denis Ivanovich, how can it be without Vasily?
What can I say to you, my dear?
There are many words in the world but no word can console you.
Let's go, Anyuta.
It's time to feed the baby.
You go, girls, thank you.
May I stay here alone for a while?
You may, dove!
Anyuta!
What do you want?
Well, and what now?
What shall we do now?
That's what how it all turned out.
Wait, Anyuta!
What I am driving at...
Where will you live now?
It' all burnt down over there.
But we've got our own place, and potatoes and millet to last the winter.
And the kid won't grow fatherless.
I'll become his father.
Let him live.
I do love you, Anyuta.
No, Fedor, it's of no use.
Winter is coming soon!
How will you live in the cold and homeless as you are!
We'll survive.
As people live, so will I.
You'd better go to the construction.
Look, they start it anew.
They need extra hands badly.
Construction?
I have much to do at the farm.
It's time to repair the roof and to lift potatoes.
Many years passed by from that day.
But I forever keep the bright image of my father and I tenderly think of my mother which didn't waver in her time of stress.
She didn't lose heart and unhesitatingly went there where a new and hitherto unknown world was being born on the site of fire and ruins.
ADUA AND HER FRIENDS
Come on, boys, we're closing.
- No present for Granny?
- Next time.
Yes, when they're open again.
Long life, strong love line, good luck is on its way.
You'll be happy, Nina.
- Love or money?
- Both.
You were born lucky.
Yes, on your back.
...22, 23, 24, 25, 26. 26 and 8.
- 34.
What's up with Adua?
Is she in love?
Coming up, Margot?
Margot?
Tonight I'm Concetta again.
I'm a respectable girl.
Sure.
From the knees down.
- Bye.
- Bye, handsome.
Face like a schoolboy, but he's a real pig.
So now we've closed down.
I thought something special would happen on our last evening.
What, like fireworks on New Year's Eve?
- No-one even realized.
- Oh, yes they did'.
Especially the soldiers.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Me?
Who's looking?
- Why, can't I even look?
- So look at this, then.
I had a guy today who'd never been before.
Poor thing.
He was curious to see one before they closed.
Just think about those boys who'll be 18 tomorrow.
Real bad luck.
What does it matter now if it leaves a mark?
Can you do my bill?
It's 28, but I'll keep one as a souvenir.
Here's 3,000 lire from the bar, 1,200 for cigarettes and a tip for Granny.
Who'd ever forget about you, Granny?
What are you doing?
Let me go!
- Hi, Adua!
- You're off?
- Yes, I'm getting the next train.
- Good luck, and keep in touch!
- Bye.
- Bye.
At least we're finished with these stairs.
I reckon 40 steps for a fortnight is like scaling K2.
I started four years ago with a soldier and I finished tonight with a brigadier.
That's quite a career!
If you came in with us you'd keep us cheerful.
I'm finished with all that now.
I'm off to Dino in Milan, remember?
We'll keep a dairy shop.
He'll serve, I'll do the till.
All day sitting down.
How much?
150.
Here's your change.
He wrote to say it's going well.
In a year we could be earning 300,000 a month.
Did you pay a lot for it?
Don't ask!
I've been sending Dino money for five years.
- When are we meeting tomorrow?
- About one, wasn't it?
I didn't phone.
What's happening?
Is Marilina coming with you?
- She says so.
- She has her bad moments.
Her last moment lasted five days.
But she's a good girl.
It's been like home for me for 30 years, just think.
In all modesty, there weren't many establishments like this one.
You've been like daughters to me.
And now you'll all be going your separate ways.
Some of you might even come to a bad end.
What's the matter with you?
Look at her!
I can't help it.
I even used to cry on the last day of school.
Marilina... telephone!
I'll get her.
Oh... you're so rude.
Look how pretty Timbuktu is with a ring in her nose!
- Hey, stop it, all right?
- What's up with you?
Telephone!
It's Adua on the phone.
Come on, it's Adua.
- Who cares?
- But you said...
- I've changed my mind.
- But we agreed...
OK, I might come.
But just go away.
Idiot.
First yes, then no.
What sort of behavior is that?
- What am I supposed to say?
- Talking to yourself?
Mind your own business.
- Well?
- I'll take it.
Hello... no, it's me, Lolita.
What do you mean, she doesn't want to?
Marilina's already up to her tricks.
Tell her to stop playing around.
About one o'clock.
Tell her noon, then she won't be late.
I wanted to tell you, because of Stefano...
You understand, right?
I won't have any money tomorrow.
I'll have the money on Wednesday when Stefano comes back.
Yes, Wednesday, don't worry.
Just a minute, Adua?
What shall I wear tomorrow?
Formal or informal?
Whatever you like.
Just wear something.
Adua, come and look.
OK, agreed.
Bye.
Yes, laugh.
You're really crazy.
I can't stand you any longer.
Turn that radio off.
You've been smoking my cigarettes.
Excuse me, have you got a cigarette?
Have one of these.
Excuse us.
Adua, what are you doing?
Stealing the menu?
Keep quiet.
You've got a very loud voice, my dear!
Seen what they're charging?
1,000 lire cover charge.
That's not a lot.
Just wait till we're doing the bills.
Imagine Adua making out the bill.
Bread 100 lire, fruit 200, Marilina 5,000.
Am I being rude?
OK, let's say 10,000 for Marilina.
Shame.
If it weren't for the shop I'd join you.
- We'd have such a good laugh.
- Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Get up.
- The radio!
- Get a move on.
I'm coming.
If you're in Milan, come to my dairy shop.
We'll have orgies with mozzarella.
Driver, I'll tell you where to stop.
Bye, Fosca.
Give Dino my love.
How old is this car?
- It's running in.
- Just like me.
Write and tell me all about it.
What a bore!
- Look, I was there in '56.
- But I was there, it was in '57.
'56.
If it was '57, I knew Fosca first.
- No.
- You do go on.
I remember it perfectly.
- That's enough.
- I'm not a fool.
- Just ask Fosca.
- It's locked.
Fetch the key.
Outside we can put some tables.
Hey, you two!
If you don't want to listen, the taxi's there.
I can find millions of girls like you.
So this is our house?
I like it.
What's it like inside?
It's lovely.
There's a staircase.
I can't see anything.
Straighten up, you'll be like a telescope.
Hey, you naughty thing!
Look, just do your job.
Who do you think we are?
Sure, you're all princesses.
You should see how they do artichokes here!
Much better than ours!
- Is it big?
How many rooms?
- Four upstairs.
One room each.
- Don't you like it?
- It's a dump.
- This will be the kitchen.
- And the restaurant will be here.
Of course it needs cleaning, what do you expect?
Certainly does!
Is it all like this?
Yes, madam, it's all like this.
I told you there was a lot to do.
Were you expecting a palace?
Anyway, we're just opening a simple country restaurant.
The restaurant's not the most important thing.
It's a bit run down, but it's big.
I don't care about this part, I want to see upstairs.
You can go up here and get out from the back.
That's convenient.
It's so gloomy!
I'm already depressed.
Wait till it's restored.
The biggest expense is bathrooms, we'll need two.
- Which is my room?
- I want a room with a view.
A lizard!
Milly, where are you?
Kill it!
Look, I've ruined my shoes.
We've got to replace the floors.
- I'm investing money in this dump?
- You'd rather give it to a pimp?
Speak for yourself.
I've never paid a man.
I've paid them and thrown them out when I got tired of them.
- Adua, why don't you...
- I don't want to know.
Just take it or leave it.
If you want to carry on working, just listen to me.
Understood?
As soon as the restaurant gets going we can start working upstairs.
And better than before.
No boss to exploit us.
And it's all in order, because it's really a restaurant.
- We haven't got a license yet.
- We'll get it, you'll see.
We're like everyone else now, we're not registered.
They've burned the records.
We're just ordinary women now.
It'd be easier if you'd brought proper money.
Don't you think that's real money?
Don't you know what a check is?
The cashier will sort it out.
Aha.
So, then?
- Um... since...
- Whenever she starts with "since"...
- Come on, what's the problem?
- Stefano couldn't stop in Rome.
He's in a hurry?
It's just for a few days.
But here's 500,000.
- Well done!
- But we agreed two million each.
- Not a good start.
- It's not my fault.
- I'm taking back my money.
- Why?
I'm pulling out.
Equal shares or nothing.
For God's sake...
Listen, I'll stand surety for Lolita.
Is that OK?
If that pig doesn't pay her back, I'll pay her share.
Happy?
Good.
Let's write. "Lolita 500,000..."
That's us!
Have the money ready.
Let's not make fools of ourselves.
Opening a current account.
Will you sign, madam?
We've all got to sign.
We're partners.
Can you sign, or just make a cross?
This bed to the first floor.
That's not mine.
Mine's got the red plush headboard.
- Stop it, you're not the only one here.
- How am I going to get my bed up?
I haven't even got a piece of my bed.
Where am I going to sleep tonight?
Why don't you come down?
What do you think?
The wardrobe here or there?
I'd put it here, and the dressing table opposite.
Would you move it for me?
Remember how nice it looked in Milan?
- I've never been to Milan.
- And this one over there.
It's lovely.
I'd have bought it myself.
My dressing table!
Where the hell am I supposed to put my things?
On the floor?
It's like being a servant!
Nobody cares about my stuff.
Why don't you sort it out?
You only care about your own things.
It's just dumb Adua who bothers about the rest.
What's all this then?
Patience is a great virtue, sisters.
Are you the new owners?
- Yes.
- Good.
It's a healthy place.
The air is clean.
It was before.
Now there's a factory that smokes all the time.
Careful!
Let me.
Where did he come from?
He should do removals.
I'd make a good monk.
Good luck!
A monk!
Congratulations.
Good stuff you've got here, sisters.
Are you opening a hotel?
- No, a restaurant.
- Good.
Good.
I'm from the convent over there.
Our pig would appreciate any scraps from the kitchen.
We'll send them over.
Don't trouble yourselves.
I come this way every day.
- Who's this?
How many of you are there?
- There are four of us, Father.
- Are you sisters?
- No, that would be too much!
- Goodbye for now.
- Goodbye.
Will you bless us, Father?
I would, but it doesn't count, I'm just a servant.
Live in happiness and peace.
Whose stuff is this?
Whose stuff is this?
Whose stuff is this?
There's no gas in the kitchen.
But there's no light either.
What, no light?
Did you apply for it?
No.
I forgot.
OK?
What are you looking at?
I'm not the only person here.
Don't make such a fuss, there are candles in the drawer.
Move over.
Let me get past.
I've only just sat down.
Use the other stairs.
Why should I go outside?
Move over.
- I'm not moving.
- I have to go upstairs.
Move over.
- Adua, look at her.
- Let her get through.
Stay where you are.
Don't move.
Don't interfere.
Watch it, you're getting on my nerves.
Watch it?
You ought to thank us on your bended knees.
We're not all old like you.
Good thing for you the brothels are closed, you'd end up in the cheapest.
You know what they used to say about you?
Go on, tell her.
Are you too scared to repeat it?
It's what you told me.
I might end up in a 200 lire brothel, but you'll end up in a madhouse.
- Like that drunkard, your father.
- Go on!
Your mind is sick.
And you'll never get better.
You even had a baby.
What about your baby?
The one that was still-born.
- Come on, shift over.
- No.
- Mother of God.
- I said she was crazy.
Fine.
So are you going to help me, or do I have to do it myself?
- What's for supper this evening?
- Jesus Christ!
We'll eat the candles.
Marilina, where are you going?
Shut the door.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
A good start for our money.
You're not helping at all.
Adua, are you asleep?
- What do you want?
- Since I was alone...
Are you frightened?
Sit down over there.
How did I wind up with you people?
One walks out, another obstinate as a mule, and you're scared of the dark.
Who do you think you are?
What would you do in my place?
I was in Africa during the war.
In a tent, always with a line outside.
Poor devils.
Next day they were dead.
They all came... but it didn't kill me.
Are you asleep?
Sleep.
You don't really care.
You're right, I don't care either.
Are you crazy?
You want to kill yourself?
Open up!
What are you doing at this time of night?
I'll rent the room.
You don't know what you're doing.
Come in.
I'm at home.
What are you wearing?
You look like a ghost.
Lolita left it.
I use it as a nightgown.
It suits you.
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs.
- Got anything to drink?
- More?
I can make a cup of tea.
- Tea?
Don't be silly.
- There's a bottle of something...
Well, open it!
What are you waiting for?
She'd even drink altar wine.
I'll put it down here.
There's my hen.
How are you?
And the chicks?
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 5...
Only 5?
One's missing.
- Where's my chick?
- What?
There used to be six.
I told you never to touch my things.
What's this disgusting stuff?
Marsala... are you crazy?
It's all I had.
The young lady left it behind.
Here's what I think of your Marsala!
We're open again!
Come on up!
Anyone at home?
No-one here?
They're in, all right.
- Did you ring?
- Sure.
I've been here ages.
Don't bother, there's no electricity.
They said I was being difficult and that they'd use candles.
Go on, ring a candle.
- Do you live here?
- Unfortunately.
- This is for Adua Giovannetti.
- For the boss!
If you had a letter box I could deliver your mail.
Send it by post.
- Here's the letter box.
- I didn't notice.
Goodbye.
- He didn't even see that.
- Stop it now.
- What a pity, they're still in bed.
- That's where you should be.
So it's you.
Welcome back.
- Thanks for the lift.
- That's OK.
Bye.
I'm a friend.
I met her in a bar and brought her home.
Thanks.
She went out to enjoy herself a bit.
I understand.
May I?
Nice.
You've got a good place here.
- Good idea.
- What idea?
For a restaurant.
Perfect place.
Not too far from the city, secluded, quiet...
- Can I use your phone?
- We haven't even got gas or light.
Tell me, did you already know my friend Marilina?
- Marilina had this for you.
- Throw it down.
Airmail.
I've got bad news for you.
- I'm going.
- Really?
That's awful.
And worse...
I'll be back soon.
- If you really want to.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
And thanks.
My God!
Nine-thirty!
Not bad looking.
Who is he?
Adua, what's the matter?
But it's impossible!
They promised!
What are you talking about?
It was all in order.
Why?
Because the police know who we are.
- They said they'd burn the files.
- They must have lost their matches.
- They're not giving us a license?
- Great!
Furniture, workmen, rent...
Just as well I only put in 500,000.
- That's a really stupid thing to say.
- What was wrong with it?
They gave Fosca a license.
We should have applied for a dairy license.
Yes, and you'd take housemaids upstairs with their bottles of milk.
- Dr. Ercoli, please.
- In the salon.
Show these ladies.
- He's over there.
- Thank you.
You wait here.
I'll speak to him first.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Please sit down.
So here I am.
- The others?
- Down there.
Shall I call them?
No, it's fine.
A dress like that... but not red, what's that new color?
- Teal.
- How refined!
Careful, he's watching us.
I know the one on the right, I've seen her often.
Make the other one turn round.
- Lolita!
- Me?
She's 23.
Firstly, the house and land are in order?
Yes, but we need a license.
That's nothing, it's the rest that's important.
What possessed you to take a rented house?
You need your head checked!
That way you'll all get cheated.
Well...
- Gicosi.
- Coming, Doctor.
Tomorrow you will sort out the land.
Gicosi will deal with everything.
I've got all the documents ready.
Shall I go to the lawyer?
- Go, go.
- And the other things?
Other things?
I'll buy the property, you pay me rent.
For the first two months, no men.
Then when the restaurant's going, you can get started.
You'll pay me a million per month.
- A million?
- That's not much.
Girls like you can earn double that.
I'd better talk to the others about it.
It's OK like this.
I've got the house, land, license, no-one will bother you.
I'll even send you customers.
You just get working.
You can't manage anything on your own.
You're in trouble before you've even started.
Keep in touch with Gicosi.
So... a lemon frappé.
What are you having?
- Strawberry ice cream.
- I'm sure they're wonderful here.
RESTAURANT
Two customers!
Idiot, come away from there!
- But didn't it say "restaurant"?
- Let's go and have a look.
- What are we going to give them?
- There's nothing ready.
- Who'll serve them?
- You.
What do I say?
Service!
Where are they?
Hello, gentlemen, what can I serve you?
- A beer.
- Is that all?
- A beer and two glasses.
- Very funny.
They had a beer, dirtied the cloth and even wanted a date.
Not bad for our first day. 90 lire.
- Look, I've done it.
- Aren't you going to eat the apple?
I don't like apples, I just like peeling them.
What are you laughing about?
I'm thinking of that 90 lire.
And he's expecting a million.
A million a month!
If it's like this every day...
- Hello.
- Hello.
Enjoy your meal, don't let me disturb you.
- But if you really insist...
- A real customer at last.
Watch him, he could sell a car to the boss of Fiat.
So you deal in cars?
Yes, and I've got just the car for you.
A jewel, a beautiful car for a beautiful lady.
It's wonderful... all yellow!
It's so big!
Want to try?
Let's go for a spin.
Who said I needed a car?
No obligation, no-one's forcing you.
It doesn't cost anything to try.
It's a bit big, but we could do with a car here.
Yeah, sure.
Come on Adua, let's buy it.
That's all we need now.
So this is the jewel?
Sure.
Comfortable, practical, smart, easy to drive...
And it's cheap.
So let's go for a drive.
- I'll be back soon.
- Bye.
- I'd buy him as well.
- How does he know Marilina?
- He says he was a friend of Rosy.
- Who's Rosy?
Do I know her?
I don't know.
I worked with a Rosy in Milan.
Has he gone?
Why didn't you tell him to wait for me?
- Silly of me!
- At least you realize it.
Marilina, wait!
Where are you going?
You're not going to leave me here alone!
There are only our dishes to wash.
I'm going to see Stefano and get my money.
Marilina, wait for me!
Just four plates, eh?
There'd be three if she washed her own.
They can't just leave me like this.
Waiter!
Who is it now?
Waiter!
What am I supposed to do now?
What can I give him?
- Why have we stopped?
- Let's smoke a cigarette.
That's what we're doing.
And you're chain-smoking.
Is it to save matches?
I've heard it all, they even ask me if I smoke in my sleep.
Even if I put it out when I'm making love.
And do you put it out?
No.
Look, do you trust me?
Well...
You should trust Piero Salvagni.
I'll tell you what.
I'll leave you the car.
Keep it for a week, a month, a year.
If you like it, keep it.
It's worth a million, yours for 600 thousand.
I'll give it back now.
Think about it.
A cat in a hurry has blind kittens.
If the cat doesn't make up its mind, the mice eat it.
Mice?
Do I look like a mouse?
Look, here's the radio, fan...
And who'd want to eat you?
And the reclining seat.
It comes up like this.
Here's the spray and the wipers.
Yes.
It's true, Piero Salvagni.
I don't trust you.
Not an inch.
I know all about men, I know what you're after.
You look safe but you've got the eyes of a snake.
- And I'm not falling for them.
- First a mouse, now a snake.
You think I do this each time I sell a car?
Not the car... but what you're thinking.
I've been a big girl for a while and I've known plenty like you.
You can play that game with Milly or Lolita, OK?
You're the one I like.
Good choice.
Sounds almost true.
It's true.
What nerve.
Every word, two lies.
You see it like that?
Wait.
Listen, you liar.
Let's get things straight.
This is where it starts and finishes.
Aren't you going to lower the seat?
What does that mean, "100 mugs"?
"100 mugs, 100 caps."
- What's that supposed to mean?
- 100 heads, 100 hats.
It means everyone's different.
When I was training for the police, I studied surveying.
- Did you take your exams in Sardinia?
- No, here on the mainland.
But aren't a surveyor and an engineer the same?
Well, the engineers do the designs and we watch over the work.
- Is there a knife?
- Over there.
Give me one too.
Thanks.
What do you want, Gorgonzola or Gruyère?
- I love Gorgonzola.
- Me, too.
Where I come from, we've got even better cheeses.
They bury them covered in sage, they're ready in three months.
Remember, you're making me a chicken-liver frittata.
Yes, but I told you...
Where I come from, we sauté the livers and add breadcrumbs.
It's much tastier that way.
If you come again I'll make it.
Of course I'll come again, our site is just over there.
I should be at work.
Can I have my bill?
Bill?
You can pay next time.
You're in a hurry now.
Tell me the truth.
How long have you been open?
Not long.
You really want to know?
You're our first customer.
Thanks.
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- I didn't do anything.
So who was it, then?
Thanks for the ride...
In the car, I mean.
Bye, boys.
You know where I live now.
- Be quiet, you fool!
- What's the matter?
Hello.
Goodbye, then.
- You see, I work over there.
- Really near.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You didn't even tell me your name.
I'm Mi...
Caterina.
Caterina Zellero.
What are you doing?
It's far too thick.
Concentrate on the spaghetti, you're acting like a chemist.
- The meat's burning.
- I'm coming.
There's far too much salt.
What do you mean?
I only put in a spoonful.
Who told you to?
I put in two spoonfuls.
Who told you to?
I made the sauce, I added the salt.
- You should have told us.
- Why?
You shouldn't interfere.
Anyone can add salt.
Let me put in the salt, it'll stop you quarrelling.
Done.
You're squabbling like schoolgirls and we have two more customers.
- The steaks and salad?
- Ready.
- Where's the salad?
- In the drainer, of course.
Oh, and we need two more spaghettis.
It needs cooking...
There, on the scales.
- I'm going to sit down.
- Who gives a damn!
- The spaghetti?
- Here.
- Too many cooks in here.
- You just keep quiet.
Do what you like, I'm exhausted.
Good day, daughters, hard at work?
Give me the salad, the steaks are getting cold.
I've only got two hands.
- God bless you all.
- Thanks, Father.
All right, let's do the sauce again.
- Don't try...
- I can do it, I can!
Milly, come here, I can't open this tin.
I cut my finger, damn it.
It looks like we're cooking for an army.
- Your steak, sir.
- Thank you.
What vegetables have you got?
Sorry?
Could I have a salad with rocket and radishes?
And some thinly-sliced cucumber and a tomato...
- We've haven't got any.
- No tomato?
We haven't got the other things either.
- So what vegetables have you got?
- The lettuce is finished.
An artichoke?
Raw...
- Some mozzarella, then.
- All right.
I'm sorry sir, we haven't even got any mozzarella.
Not even mozzarella?
Could I have some fruit, then?
- A nice apple?
- All right, an apple.
Lolita, listen.
This is a restaurant.
- For the time being, at least.
- And?
And try not to wiggle your bum so much.
I saw her winking at a customer.
I didn't wink, his wife was there.
I was smiling politely.
Can't we even smile?
- Yes, but smile properly.
- What a fuss.
- I've never worked as a waitress.
- Where's the mineral water?
Milly, your customer's arrived.
Now we've lost her.
Look, I made it again today.
But if you'd rather have something else...
No, I'm kidding.
It's my favorite.
- First course?
- Spaghetti.
It's ready.
Then I'll bring your favorite.
Tomorrow, I'll try adding some onion.
Will you let me do your hair?
- Please.
- What a bore.
I saw a lovely style in a fashion magazine.
- What's wrong with it?
- Everything.
Even the gears...
He's ripped you off, I told you so.
Don't be cheeky!
It's not easy to rip me off.
I'm not Lolita.
Leave the poor thing out of it this time.
Stefano's giving her back her money tomorrow, isn't he?
Yes, and don't joke about it.
He's out of town now, his landlady told me.
- He was hiding in the toilet.
- He's in Sicily with the company.
Where he'll find another idiot like you to play his showgirl.
Better to play the showgirl than work as a servant.
The work was easier before.
That's what I said.
When are we going to start again?
Less tiring...
And I like it more.
Where can I wash?
I'd like to wash my hands.
- There's a sink over there.
- Thanks.
Shall we play with him?
Ladies... onstage!
Give me that money!
You're in trouble this time.
You can't cheat me like that, I'll teach you!
- OK, stop it now.
- Are you hurt?
- Want something?
A brandy?
- No, why?
A glass of water.
I don't know...
Something about an apartment, 200,000...
Mr. Salvagni.
Commander!
How are you?
- The car?
- It's just coming.
You're so punctual!
Here it is!
Come along.
You're here.
Listen, you clown, let's get this straight.
You keep quiet, I'll do the talking.
Don't you want to sell it?
Commander, come here.
Watch how I deal with him.
Madame, leave it here, the policeman's a friend of mine.
Officer, it's all right, I know the lady.
Madame, allow me to introduce Commander Massano.
Let's have a look at it.
Isn't it a gem?
Look, the paintwork is perfect.
It's magnificent.
And new brakes.
And look at the upholstery!
The lady wants to sell because she's ordered a later model.
You've got to try it, it's a marvel.
Tell the Commander how it drives.
- It's really...
- There, what did I say?
It's a status symbol, just the car for you.
- What about petrol consumption?
- You're joking!
Tell him, don't let him hear it just from me.
Not a lot, about 4 kilometers a liter...
- Four?
- She means miles, it's an American car.
Four miles, about seven kilometers, just like a Fiat 1100.
I swear, it's a bargain you'll thank me for.
Anyway, we'll try it out.
Just let me find the lady a taxi.
Have a coffee while you're waiting, it's paid for.
Goodbye, Commander.
Only a moment, Officer.
My compliments.
What smooth talking!
- You've got to be smart in my job.
- So I've seen.
- Look, Adua, do you like this one?
- No, why?
You gave me 400 thousand for that one, this is worth much more.
I'll give it in exchange.
Doctor, I'm taking this one.
- Get in, it's yours
- I don't want it.
Try it.
Give it back if you don't like it.
Then you'll give me a Vespa in exchange.
This one is perfect for you.
Come on, start it up.
It goes like a Ferrari.
What's the matter?
You've got to trust me, understand?
You and me, eh?
Go, go.
I'll come and see you down at the restaurant.
Bye.
We're just going.
Commander, here I am.
Here's the starter...
Handbrake...
Indicator...
- Is that you?
- Hi there!
- Here, catch!
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.
Open it.
- What is it?
Hey, it won't explode.
100,000 lire, nothing to fear.
I made 200 from your old banger.
100 each.
So are you coming down or am I coming up?
I'll come down.
- How much?
- 850.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, miss.
Good night.
Come on, Carletto.
We're here.
We'll go to bed now.
Keep quiet.
Is that you, Marilina?
Hi there.
Just as well you're back, we've had so many customers.
- How's your little boy?
- Well.
Thanks for asking.
But you've brought him here?
Evening...
Did you see?
She's brought the boy.
Be good, OK?
Pajamas...
- So you brought him here?
- As you can see.
- Poor thing.
Are you sleepy?
- Leave him alone.
He doesn't know you.
- You'll frighten him like that.
- Quiet, I'm trying to sleep.
Good idea.
What possessed you?
- Couldn't you leave him with the nanny?
- This is my house, paid with my money.
So I'll bring anyone I want.
I've only seen him ten times.
At least for a few days.
You're not getting up to anything.
It's like a convent here.
You go to sleep now.
What's going on here?
Behaving like a landlady, and she hasn't paid a penny.
- I'll do what I want too, sometimes.
- I paid 500,000.
- What's the matter with her?
- She's brought her kid.
What kid?
Marilina, he's crying.
Have you got tummy ache?
No.
Why?
What was I doing?
Talking?
Did I wake you up?
Go to sleep now.
- Why aren't you asleep?
- The light's on.
- Do you always sleep in the dark?
- Light's expensive.
- What's this?
You've got a bump.
- I don't know.
Let me see.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
You must sleep now.
Ah, the light.
I can't sleep in the dark...
Oh, God.
Are you afraid?
Give me your hand.
Put the meat under there.
They can bring the fruit later.
What are you doing here?
What a state you're in!
- Where's your mommy?
- She's asleep.
You take care of him.
Oh, poor thing!
37.7, almost 38.
And such a headache.
I'm all alone here.
Are you busy, Adua?
Really?
Please, just this once.
And you can bring me some cigarettes, too.
Hurry up!
OK, I'll come over.
Before all hell breaks loose here.
I'll be right back.
He says he's ill.
Don't forget the fish, Carmela can help you.
He's here.
He was hungry.
Jesus.
Couldn't you wake me up?
I got such a fright.
Come in quickly, it's so cold here.
- What's the matter with you?
- Pain in the shoulder, I feel bad.
You've caught cold.
Or a chill.
Chill?
It might be pleurisy.
You know what the pleura is?
It's that membrane round the lungs.
It starts here... and it hurts here.
- Have you taken anything?
- Aspirin, pills, nose drops...
And three packets of cigarettes.
What have you brought me?
Hey, are you mad?
Do you want to kill me?
A friend of mine had the same thing.
He got over it in two hours.
I can't remember what he took for it.
Who does your cleaning?
I'll call him now.
I sold him a Giulietta Sprint, a real bargain.
Hello?
Dr. Renzi?
He's out of the office?
Give me the director, it's urgent.
He's with the director, a real big shot.
Dr. Renzi, it's Piero, Piero Salvagni.
How's the car?
I told you it was a bargain.
All right, I understand.
I'm coming!
It's such a mess in here.
What does it matter?
You always leave me alone.
Where have you been?
What did your friend say?
Who?
He didn't remember.
I'm really ill.
I don't understand what anyone's saying.
No, he's out.
I said he wasn't in.
Do what you like, then.
Who told you to do that?
It's none of your business!
Can't I be left in peace in my own home?
One day I'll...
What's got into you?
What'll you do?
Nothing, what do you think?
I didn't mean it.
What can I do?
Just go on with it.
If only I was on my own.
Are you married?
Are you crazy?
That was my mother.
When I remember, I send her money.
She wants to know everything I do, where I've been.
I tell her a pack of lies.
Sometimes I forget what I said the day before.
Always hanging round my neck!
Listen to this disc I bought yesterday!
Those trains.
How do you stand it?
They keep me company.
I like the noise.
Listen to that!
Keep covered.
Does it hurt?
Yes, it's starting again.
Will you give me a massage?
Down a bit.
There!
I'm so cold.
Come into bed and warm me up a bit.
- No.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- What's the matter now?
I'm telling you, I don't know.
Turn round.
Strange.
I feel shy with you.
Adua!
Modugno's here!
- The singer?
- Yes, Modugno!
Just as well you're back, we're snowed under.
- He liked the frittata.
He wants more.
- It's finished.
Your sardine must be tired of eating it every day.
Perhaps he won't come today.
He'll come.
And he's not a sardine, he's a Sardinian.
And he's a customer, just like the others.
Just give me a hand here.
18 customers, all these plates to do.
The meat's on the stove, we've got to wash the salad, but I'm going.
Need a hand?
I'll wash the salad.
I always do it at the convent.
When he talks it's different from when he sings.
Brother Michele washing the salad!
I'm earning the pig's dinner.
He's fattening up nicely.
Do you think she'll make it as a singer?
Another one!
What a fine family!
Nice place you've got.
And the food's good.
Thanks, Mr. Modugno.
We'll do even better next time.
We've only just opened.
You should do pasta with sardines.
Of course, I'll tell the cook.
You see, she hasn't quite got the warmth...
I put it in the boot of the car.
Run and fetch it.
Good idea.
We've been waiting 10 minutes for our first course.
I'll go and see.
Decide what you want for the main course, better order it now.
Milly, did you see him?
- Modugno?
Of course.
- No, the lawyer there, with his wife.
Yes, it's him, he always used to come.
Excuse me, where can I wash my hands?
Outside, on the right.
I'll be back in a minute.
When do we get some food?
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
I hoped...
I thought you didn't recognize me.
What a surprise to see you here!
What are you doing?
You see?
We've got a restaurant.
Come off it.
With a waitress like that?
- Isn't that...
- Caterina.
No... "Golden Thighs"...
Milly!
I get it.
I think I'll be coming here often.
Without my wife, of course.
You can bring your wife, we haven't started upstairs.
Better if she doesn't know the way here.
- Aren't you going to wash your hands?
- I don't need to.
Small world.
- Haven't they brought anything?
- It'll come sometime.
Some bread, even.
Bad idea of yours to stop here.
And the food won't be any good.
He's going to sing!
I'll dedicate this song to all proud lovers.
He's a tenor, isn't he?
I want some, too.
Just a sip.
It's not good for you.
Father?
To get baptized...
What's the maximum age you can do it?
Baptism?
Aren't you baptized?
I am, but...
The boy?
So what are you waiting for?
When he was born I was ill.
And you know how things get put off.
You were ill.
Couldn't his father arrange it?
There's always time.
Jesus was baptized when he was 30.
- There you are.
- But we chose one with frosted glass.
It's much nicer if you can see what's inside.
What are we going to put in it?
Everything.
Meat here, vegetables there...
Wine, fish, fruit... the lot!
It's beautiful.
What's he telling her out there?
He hasn't shut his mouth for a second.
Look at his face!
He won't repay her.
"Stefano, Stefano!" What a hope.
You, me, Grazia, Doris, two actors, some dancing...
This meat's good, isn't it?
- Excellent.
- And we'll have Totò Brusca.
- Who's that?
- You don't know who Totò Brusca is?
Tell her, Calypso.
You're out of touch.
He won the Salerno Festival.
They were all after him, but I got in first.
Show her the contract.
- It's all right, I believe you.
- Pass the salad.
How's the salad?
Tender?
- Wonderful.
- We've got all of Wanda's new costumes.
- Remember that act "Pink Samba"?
- Yes, I was supposed to go with Osiris that year.
We'll use them when you do your turn with Calypso.
- Me... with him?
- You haven't seen him on stage.
Not classical stuff... but there's no-one to beat his modern dancing.
Show her the photo.
This salad would be perfect with some anchovy.
- I'll get some if you like.
- Perhaps later, with some cheese.
Did you notice the bouquet of this wine?
- Exquisite!
- He looks OK in tails.
Listen, Lolita, I know what I'm doing.
And I'm a big name in the South.
When they see "Bamboo and his Troupe" they're happy to buy tickets.
One night in Bari they had to call the police.
We start in Palermo on the 25th.
We're booked all over Sicily.
20 days in Naples.
We'll make two million in three months.
And you'll stay here as a waitress?
You've invested 500,000?
Give me that 500,000, come back to the theatre, you'll have your daily pay.
You'll earn back all the money you gave me.
- As a lady, not a servant.
- Yes, a servant.
That's all I am here.
I'll take my money and go back to the theatre.
Don't forget the anchovies!
- You think 500,000 is enough?
- Even 400.
If we go down any more, we'll end with 10,000.
I've made up my mind, I'm going back to the theatre.
I'm leaving and I want my money back.
Just when it's going well?
You want to make things difficult?
I don't care, it's my money.
I gave you 500,000.
Give it back or I'll go to a lawyer, I'll take you to court.
Go upstairs.
We'll talk later.
You bitch!
I want my money!
Just keep out of the way.
I want my money!
You see?
She's OK, her friends are the problem.
Wiping your plate?
They'll really think you're dying of hunger.
We won't get a penny here.
- You think we'd better...
- It's the best thing...
Did you ask for your bill?
We were guests.
I'm the only person here who has guests.
We've been your guests, then.
Thank you.
So you've had a free meal and we've avoided being fleeced.
No, look... call Lolita.
Don't worry, I'll speak to Lolita.
- There's some mistake here.
- No mistake.
Come on.
3,600 lire.
Robbers!
- Come on, join us.
- No.
- Don't be like that!
- No.
Do I have to say sorry?
She's so obstinate!
Open your mouth.
It's sugar.
It's not sugar.
- I renounce him.
- I renounce him.
- Who are we renouncing?
- Satan.
I'm the only lay brother in the convent, I do all the cooking, cleaning...
- Here's the cake.
- It's too much for me.
Get some poor person to help.
Well, it's not that easy to find one.
- Here's the cake.
Congratulations!
- Who made it?
Milly?
She's too busy thinking about her boyfriend.
Adua bought it this morning.
- Here, take it.
- Thanks, Auntie!
Go easy, you'll squash him.
When I met you it was just a shell...
nearly three months ago.
Three months on Thursday...
I think.
I've eaten hundreds of frittatas.
Don't be offended, but I've got to confess...
My mother often used to make it, but I don't really like frittata with liver.
Why did you eat it, then?
Because it was you who cooked it.
Do you mind?
No.
I just wish I'd realized.
And didn't you notice I came on Sundays.
No-one was working here.
I live in Primavalle.
But I drove 12 kilometers...
A cigarette?
You see...
I felt at home when I came.
Until my mother died two years ago, I used to go home each summer.
You see, Caterina...
I haven't been feeling so lonely.
I'd see you twice a day.
And your friends are nice too.
In about a month we'll be finished here.
Where will you be working?
Won't you come to us again?
Oh, yes, in the evenings.
But I was thinking...
I mean... wouldn't it be better if I didn't have to come?
What do you mean, "didn't have to..."?
Well... if you agree... of course you'll need to think about it...
I've never talked like this before.
How do you ask a girl if...
Yes, if she wants to get married.
I haven't got a smart house like this, with three bathrooms.
I told you, I live in Primavalle.
But we could get a TV... in installments.
Or we can always go the cinema.
There's no hurry.
I've been doing all the talking.
Give me your answer in your own time.
I'm sorry, Emilio, it's impossible.
I'll never forget.
Thank you.
But why?
Tell me why.
I knew you wanted to tell me something.
It kept me awake at night.
I hoped... but I was afraid...
Why?
Nothing you say will make any difference.
I know what life's like.
No, let me go.
Is there someone else?
No.
Not the way you mean.
But there have been lots.
We aren't school friends.
If you must know, we worked together in the same houses, same towns.
We were on the game.
Do you understand?
Happy now?
You forced me to say it.
Just as well.
What was I thinking of?
Just as well.
I was right, you see.
There are things you can't understand.
It's not always "100 heads, 100 hats".
You're not saying anything?
Who'd marry a girl like me?
You think you could introduce me to your friends?
Think of it!
Well, don't you think it's funny?
I do.
You asked for my hand... as though you were talking to my mother.
And don't come to the restaurant again.
- Who do you think I look like?
- A tart.
Spiteful bitch.
You're always so insulting.
Don't you think I look like Anita Ekberg?
Spitting image!
Go and change now, they'll be coming soon.
- You're back early.
- I've been out too long.
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that now?
Out of the way, you don't know how.
We've got to start working properly.
- This isn't proper work?
- Yes, ruining our hands in the kitchen.
What about the million we owe that guy?
You like making soup?
I'm sick of it, if that's all right with you.
I want to go back home.
- Did we lose?
- It didn't even cross the line.
- Weren't you watching?
- So many smart people here.
It's a real aristocratic gathering.
See that man over there?
- Which one?
- Him.
He's the Prince of San Marino.
- Which one?
!
- The one selling ice cream.
You're crazy.
Go on, choose a dog.
- Like before?
- With the luck we've had?
Can I have a light?
We'll go for Abukir.
Let's put on 10,000 lira together.
Just don't run away with the money.
Do I look the type who would?
No, but once Lolita had 100,000 lira stolen from her.
You take it then, open your own account.
Can't you take a joke?
- Let's bet together, then.
- Do you think I don't trust you?
Go!
If anyone bothers you, say you're with Piero Salvagni.
Look who it is!
What are you doing here?
I want to win a few million so I can buy you a present.
- Big spender!
- Are you alone?
You think I go out alone at night?
I'm with Ulisse.
So, you're well settled.
Ulisse is more of a gentleman than you.
Call me, you'll see what a gentleman I can be.
Will you call me?
Not bad, eh?
It's busy here.
That's a good sign.
Sure it's the right place?
Of course. "Adua's".
Look.
Look!
Yes, now I see.
Ercoli's always right.
When I'm in Rome he sends me somewhere good.
- Are you alone?
- Very alone.
- Inside or outside?
- It's better over there.
No?
Someone wants to know how you do the scampi.
I said I'd let her know when you're in a better mood.
I'm not in a bad mood.
Or if I am, it's your fault.
Yes, it's always our fault.
- Whose fault is it, then?
- There are two men...
Listen.
Ercoli sent them, they want to go upstairs.
It was too good to be true.
Now we've got to go upstairs for the first pig that turns up.
Adua isn't even here tonight.
She's playing sweethearts.
If they want to eat we're here to serve them.
For the other thing, tell them to come back when we're all here.
- Two nice boys, at least.
- You didn't choose them before.
Don't be difficult about it.
What are you doing?
If it's so important, she can go.
Go on, what are you waiting for?
Get upstairs.
She took him upstairs.
One of us had to.
Shut up!
What's he done?
Mind your own business.
When the frittata's ready, can I have one without liver?
My fruit, please?
Who are you?
Who are you, little boy?
- I'm Carletto.
- He's Marilina's son.
- Shall I fetch someone?
- Don't bother.
Indian Vendetta.
It's a Western.
- I like Westerns.
- They're for children.
Valley of the Beavers.
That could be interesting.
Like it?
Yes.
Why not?
It's the landlord.
I'll see you at lunchtime.
- But we haven't chosen a film.
- Yes, the Valley of the Whatsits.
Good day, Doctor.
I'll get Adua immediately.
Wait here for me.
Good day, Doctor.
- Will you sit down here?
- No.
Let's have a look upstairs.
- But it's a mess.
- Doesn't matter.
Don't you knock?
Had a good look?
I'm sending Antonietta tomorrow.
Remember her?
She was at Virginia's.
She can do the cooking.
Have you seen yourselves in the mirror?
The other night I sent a client.
He had good things to say about you lot... as waitresses.
We haven't really got going.
It's still early days.
This needs tidying up.
The restaurant's going fine.
Get rid of the kids, the strangers and sacks of potatoes in the bedrooms.
Get to work.
I can't.
I'm getting married.
Congratulations!
This doesn't make any difference.
I don't give a damn about your private lives.
You don't think she'd stay here and work for you if she's married!
We had an agreement.
I didn't invest all my money to open a rehabilitation centre.
I've already waited a month.
Get married, become nuns, do what you like but you've got to stay here and pay what we agreed.
A million a month!
Goodbye!
We pay the rent!
- We'll make the rest when it suits us.
- If it suits us!
You have 24 hours to decide.
If not, you're out of here tomorrow!
- We're not moving.
It's our house!
- It's all ours!
It's all mine.
The house and everything in it.
You'll clear out of here.
And I mean what I say.
I'll report you, you understand?
He can't do anything.
The license is in my name!
I got it and I can take it away.
A restaurant can't be run by women like you.
You have police records.
Understand what that means?
Sort it out.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Stormy weather, eh?
Are you angry with someone?
With everybody!
It's this crap world!
Don't say that.
You should pray, daughter.
Praying makes you a better person.
Of course!
So when I've become a good person, someone who hasn't been praying comes along and rips me off.
You lot preach...
talk Latin... say Mass...
- But what do you know about life?
- Of course, life is a sacrifice...
Do you know what the four of us were?
What we used to do?
It doesn't matter what you were.
What matters is what you are and will be...
I'll tell you what we will be...
exactly what we were!
Why?
Because that's how it is.
Even if we prayed on our knees for ten years.
And what do you do?
What can you do?
Come on, show me!
You can only say, "God's will be done".
How dare you speak like that in front of this child?
Hold your tongue!
I'm sorry, Father Michele.
I needed to get it out.
I hope you feel better...
Goodbye.
I'll pray for you.
Thank you.
Do you know what, Carletto?
Tomorrow, you'll go away with Carmela.
Back to your nanny.
Are you happy?
I want to stay here.
We have the right to stay here.
I want to work here till I get married.
And maybe even afterwards.
Even if I never make love again, I'd rather die than do it for that pig!
Shut up!
You'll wake up the child!
Think it's fair I can't keep the child so that bastard can earn money?
I'm going to smash his head in tomorrow!
- Who could it be at this time?
- Probably some drunk.
Who's there?
Wait, I'll be right down!
Who is it?
- Is it Thursday today?
- So?
A client owed me money, I'd forgotten all about it.
He's brought me the money so I can go straight to the bank tomorrow.
Do you work even at night?
Of course!
You're work too!
It's a dog's life, I tell you!
Oh, my cigarettes...
Wait here, OK?
He said I was old...
but it's him that's queer.
I was afraid you'd be out...
Why did you come down?
Sorry, my mother is here...
She's sleeping.
I tried to ring you all day.
I've been very busy.
What's wrong?
What's happened?
Got a light?
You didn't come all this way for a light, did you?
I'm not in a joking mood.
- They're kicking us out!
- From where?
The restaurant.
Did Milly poison someone with her mushrooms?
This morning we had a row with the landlord.
He says we should keep our agreement.
But the restaurant is doing fine now.
It's thanks to us.
It's a job that lasts, that you can do also later.
Later when?
Later...
when we're not young any more.
And then there's Marilina's child, Milly's getting married...
What can we do, Piero?
You are asking me, Adua, my love?
What do I know?
How can I help you?
I don't even know him.
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
What's that got to do with it?
Wouldn't you prefer it if I just had the restaurant?
Wouldn't it be better?
So why should we start again like before?
Did you see the one that just went past?
I don't want to end up like that.
Why?
But you haven't been?
Go on.
No, I'm saying...
I'm not talking about you.
But...
Marilina...
I thought that...
No?
I don't know.
I must have made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
What did I say, Adua?
Know what we'll do?
We'll sort things out tomorrow.
I'll go and talk to him, eh?
I'll talk to him myself.
And what are you going to tell him?
That you agree with him?
That things are fine like that?
Because you all agree, eh?
You, him and all the others!
And what are we?
We're branded like cattle!
Piero!
Piero, aren't you coming back in?
Calm down, he's coming.
And you can keep your Piero.
He's all yours!
It's not what you think.
She came with my mother.
She's an orphan.
Come up and see for yourself.
Adua...
Stop!
What's going on?
To hell with you!
That's all I need.
The whole world is against me.
Look, I've even hurt myself.
What do you all want from me?
I'm almost 35.
I have the right to...
He's here!
Open the door!
What are you doing?
What are we going to say?
You've got to talk to him.
Open up, Adua!
Come down!
I'll tell him you're coming down.
Hurry up!
Adua's coming down.
Thank you, there's no hurry.
This is fine.
Dr. Ercoli, is this OK with you?
I have my working clothes on.
We're ready.
From this moment on, the bedrooms are open to the public.
Come on, gentlemen.
Don't be afraid of the police!
We have an excellent protector!
Isn't that right, Dr. Ercoli?
Happy now?
This is the way we should work, isn't it?
Isn't this what you wanted?
You, sir, do you want to come up?
If you don't like me, you can choose one of my colleagues.
Come on, you don't have to marry them!
Girls, get down to work.
You have to make Dr. Ercoli rich.
And remember, we're not waitresses.
We're whores.
It's all we're allowed to do here.
- Nothing else.
- She's mad!
What are you doing?
Are you leaving already?
Don't you want to check your profits?
Do you want to smoke?
Thank you.
Hey, gorgeous.
Your free ticket home.
You're still a bachelor.
If you want to get married...
We wanted to send him to prison, the professional with a clean record, and instead...
Give me a paper, please.
- Here you are.
- No, Il Tempo.
Here's Il Tempo.
Hot off the press.
The brothel was disguised as a restaurant...
They even have our pictures.
It's strange.
I've never been up so early before.
It's beautiful.
We did a very good job with it, eh?
Hello, Emilio, it's Caterina...
But...
Emilio!
Sorry.
Thank you.
Wasn't he there?
He's not there.
He's gone away.
Maybe he really has gone away.
Don't you think?
Of course.
He told me himself on the phone.
I recognized his voice!
Why?
You'd already told him everything.
Yes, but he was the only one to know then.
Now we're in all the papers.
I can understand him.
Ah, yes...
You defend even him now!
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
It's nothing to do with you.
If you hadn't done it, I would have.
And maybe I'd have even broken Ercoli's neck.
Pity, Ercoli's lost a glass.
And a plate.
Yes, come on!
Come on!
One evening we had 80 people eating.
It's hard work but it's very satisfying.
Do you understand?
- I understand.
- Tell her about Modugno!
One day, Modugno came in!
He told me I was good.
He wanted to teach me how to cook pasta with sardines!
I'm not like one of them.
What do you think I'm doing here?
Have you been drinking tonight?
I'm only here to make money.
I already have some.
I've seen a place which is just perfect.
The garden's small.
But the kitchen is so big!
Are you deaf?
Have you found a cook?
Take Adriana.
She can cook you up some dishes.
Shut up!
You old drunkard!
No, I won't end up like you!
I can't!
I can't!
THE END
Come on, boys, we're closing.
- No present for Granny?
- Next time.
Yes, when they're open again.
Long life, strong love line, good luck is on its way.
You'll be happy, Nina.
- Love or money?
- Both.
You were born lucky.
Yes, on your back.
...22, 23, 24, 25, 26. 26 and 8.
- 34.
What's up with Adua?
Is she in love?
Coming up, Margot?
Margot?
Tonight I'm Concetta again.
I'm a respectable girl.
Sure.
From the knees down.
Face like a schoolboy, but he's a real pig.
So now we've closed down.
I thought something special would happen on our last evening.
What, like fireworks on New Year's Eve?
- No-one even realised.
- Oh, yes they did!
Especially the soldiers.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Me?
Who's looking?
- Why, can't I even look?
- So look at this, then.
I had a guy today who'd never been before.
Poor thing.
He was curious to see one before they closed.
Just think about those boys who'll be 18 tomorrow.
Real bad luck.
What does it matter now if it leaves a mark?
Can you do my bill?
It's 28, but I'll keep one as a souvenir.
Here's 3,000 lire from the bar, 1,200 for cigarettes and a tip for Granny.
Who'd ever forget about you, Granny?
What are you doing?
Let me go!
- Hi, Adua!
- You're off?
- Yes, I'm getting the next train.
- Good luck, and keep in touch!
At least we're finished with these stairs.
I reckon 40 steps for a fortnight is like scaling K2.
I started four years ago with a soldier and I finished tonight with a brigadier.
That's quite a career!
If you came in with us you'd keep us cheerful.
I'm finished with all that now.
I'm off to Dino in Milan, remember?
We'll keep a dairy shop.
He'll serve, I'll do the till.
All day sitting down.
How much?
150.
Here's your change.
He wrote to say it's going well.
In a year we could be earning 300,000 a month.
Did you pay a lot for it?
You're telling me!
I've been sending Dino money for five years.
- When are we meeting tomorrow?
- About one, wasn't it?
I didn't phone.
What's happening?
Is Marilina coming with you?
- She says so.
- She has her bad moments.
Her last moment lasted five days.
But she's a good girl.
It's been like home for me for 30 years, just think.
In all modesty, there weren't many establishments like this one.
You've been like daughters to me.
And now you'll all be going your separate ways.
Some of you might even come to a bad end.
What's the matter with you?
Look at her!
I can't help it.
I even used to cry on the last day of school.
Marilina... telephone!
I'll get her.
Oh... you're so rude.
Look how pretty Timbuktu is with a ring in her nose!
- Hey, stop it, all right?
- What's up with you?
Telephone!
It's Adua on the phone.
Come on, it's Adua.
- Who cares?
- But you said...
- I've changed my mind.
- But we agreed...
OK, I might come.
But just go away.
Idiot.
First yes, then no.
What sort of behaviour is that?
- What am I supposed to say?
- Talking to yourself?
Mind your own business.
- Well?
- I'll take it.
Hello... no, it's me, Lolita.
What do you mean, she doesn't want to?
Marilina's already up to her tricks.
Tell her to stop playing around.
About one o'clock.
Tell her midday, then she won't be late.
I wanted to ask...
you understand about Stefano?
I won't have any money tomorrow.
I'll have the money on Wednesday when Stefano comes back.
Yes, Wednesday, don't worry.
Just a minute, Adua?
What shall I wear tomorrow?
Formal or informal?
Whatever you like.
Just wear something.
Adua, come and look.
OK, agreed.
Bye.
Turn that radio off.
You've been smoking my cigarettes.
Excuse me, have you got a cigarette?
Have one of these.
Excuse us.
Adua, what are you doing?
Stealing the menu?
Keep quiet.
You've got a very loud voice, my dear!
Seen what they're charging?
1,000 cover charge.
That's not a lot.
Just wait till we're doing the bills.
Imagine Adua making out the bill.
Bread 100 lire, fruit 200, Marilina 5,000.
Am I being rude?
OK, let's say 10,000 for Marilina.
Shame.
If it weren't for the shop I'd join you.
- We'd have such a good laugh.
- Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Get up.
- The radio!
- Get a move on.
I'm coming.
If you're in Milan, come to my dairy shop.
We'll have orgies with mozzarella.
Driver, I'll tell you where to stop.
Bye, Fosca.
Give Dino my love.
How old is this car?
- It's running in.
- Just like me.
Write and tell me all about it.
What a bore!
- Look, I was there in '56.
- But I was there, it was in '57.
'56.
If it was '57, I knew Fosca first.
- No.
- You do go on.
I remember it perfectly.
- That's enough.
- I'm not a fool.
- Just ask Fosca.
- It's locked.
Fetch the key.
Hey, you two!
If you don't want to listen, the taxi's there.
I can find millions of girls like you.
So this is our house?
I like it.
What's it like inside?
It's lovely.
There's a staircase.
I can't see anything.
Straighten up, you'll be like a telescope.
Hey, you naughty thing!
Look, just do your job.
Who do you think we are?
Sure, you're all princesses.
You should see how they do artichokes here!
Much better than ours!
- Is it big?
How many rooms?
- Four upstairs.
One room each.
- Don't you like it?
- It's a dump.
- This will be the kitchen.
- And the restaurant will be here.
Of course it needs cleaning, what do you expect?
Certainly does!
Is it all like this?
Yes, madam, it's all like this.
I told you there was a lot to do.
Were you expecting a palace?
Anyway, we're just opening a simple country restaurant.
The restaurant's not the most important thing.
It's a bit run down, but it's big.
I don't care about this part, I want to see upstairs.
You can go up here and get out from the outside.
That's convenient.
It's so gloomy!
I'm already depressed.
Wait till it's restored.
The biggest expense is bathrooms, we'll need two.
- Which is my room?
- I want a room with a view.
A lizard!
Milly, where are you?
Kill it!
Look, I've ruined my shoes.
We've got to replace the floors.
- I'm investing money in this dump?
- You'd rather give it to a pimp?
Speak for yourself.
I've never paid a man.
I've paid them and thrown them out when I got tired of them.
- Adua, why don't you...
- I don't want to know.
Just take it or leave it.
If you want to carry on working, just listen to me.
Understood?
As soon as the restaurant gets going we can start working upstairs.
And better than before.
No boss to exploit us.
And it's all in order, because it's really a restaurant.
- We haven't got a licence yet.
- We'll get it, you'll see.
We're like everyone else now, we're not registered.
They've burned the records.
We're just ordinary women now.
It'd be easier if you'd brought proper money.
Don't you think that's real money?
Don't you know what a cheque is?
The cashier will sort it out.
Aha.
So, then?
- Um... since...
- Whenever she starts with "since"...
- Come on, what's the problem?
- Stefano couldn't stop in Rome.
He's in a hurry?
It's just for a few days.
But here's 500,000.
- Well done!
- But we agreed two million each.
- Not a good start.
- It's not my fault.
- I'm taking back my money.
- Why?
I'm pulling out.
Equal shares or nothing.
For God's sake...
Listen, I'll stand surety for Lolita.
Is that OK?
If that pig doesn't pay her back, I'll pay her share.
Happy?
Good.
Let's write. "Lolita 500,000..."
That's us!
Have the money ready.
Let's not make fools of ourselves.
Opening a current account.
Will you sign, madam?
We've all got to sign.
We're partners.
Can you sign, or just make a cross?
This bed to the first floor.
That's not mine.
Mine's got the red plush headboard.
- Stop it, you're not the only one here.
- How am I going to get my bed up?
I haven't even got a piece of my bed.
Where am I going to sleep tonight?
Why don't you come down?
What do you think?
The wardrobe here or there?
I'd put it here, and the dressing table opposite.
Would you move it for me?
Remember how nice it looked in Milan?
- I've never been to Milan.
- And this one over there.
It's lovely.
I'd have bought it myself.
My dressing table!
Where the hell am I supposed to put my things?
On the floor?
It's like being a servant!
Nobody cares about my stuff.
Why don't you sort it out?
You only care about your own things.
It's just dumb Adua who bothers about the rest.
What's all this then?
Patience is a great virtue, sisters.
Are you the new owners?
- Yes.
- Good.
It's a healthy place.
The air is clean.
It was before.
Now there's a factory that smokes all the time.
Careful!
Let me.
Where did he come from?
He should do removals.
I'd make a good monk.
Good luck!
A monk!
Congratulations.
Good stuff you've got here, sisters.
Are you opening a hotel?
- No, a restaurant.
- Good.
Good.
I'm from the convent over there.
Our pig would appreciate any scraps from the kitchen.
We'll send them over.
Don't trouble yourselves.
I come this way every day.
- Who's this?
How many of you are there?
- There are four of us, Father.
- Are you sisters?
- No, that would be too much!
- Goodbye for now.
- Goodbye.
Will you bless us, Father?
I will, but it doesn't count, I'm just a servant.
Live in happiness and peace.
Whose stuff is this?
Whose stuff is this?
Whose stuff is this?
There's no gas in the kitchen.
But there's no light either.
What, no light?
Did you apply for it?
No.
I forgot.
Ok?
What are you looking at?
I'm not the only person here.
Don't make such a fuss, there are candles in the drawer.
Move over.
Let me get past.
I've only just sat down.
Use the other stairs.
Why should I go outside?
Move over.
- I'm not moving.
- I have to go upstairs.
Move over.
- Adua, look at her.
- Let her get through.
Stay where you are.
Don't move.
Don't interfere.
Watch it, you're getting on my nerves.
Watch it?
You ought to thank us on your bended knees.
We're not all old like you.
Good thing for you the brothels are closed, you'd end up in the cheapest.
You know what they used to say about you?
Go on, tell her.
Are you too scared to repeat it?
It's what you told me.
I might end up in a 200 lire brothel, but you'll end up in a madhouse.
- Like that drunkard, your father.
- Go on!
You're mind is sick.
And you'll never get better.
You even had a baby.
What about your baby?
The one that was still-born.
- Come on, shift over.
- No.
- Mother of God.
- I said she was crazy.
Fine.
So are you going to help me, or must I do it all by myself?
- What's for supper this evening?
- Jesus Christ!
We'll eat the candles.
Marilina, where are you going?
Shut the door.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
A good start for our money.
Yes, you can put some money in too now.
Adua, are you asleep?
- What do you want?
- Since I was alone...
Are you frightened?
Sit down over there.
How did I get landed with you lot?
One walks out, another obstinate as a mule, and you're scared of the dark.
Who do you think you are?
What would you do in my place?
I was in Africa during the war.
In a tent, always with a queue outside.
Poor devils.
Next day they were dead.
They all came... but it didn't kill me.
Are you asleep?
Sleep.
You don't really care.
You're right, I don't care either.
Are you crazy?
You want to kill yourself?
Open up!
What are you doing at this time of night?
I'll rent the room.
You don't know what you're doing.
Come in.
I'm at home.
What are you wearing?
You look like a ghost.
Lolita left it.
I use it as a nightgown.
It suits you.
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs.
- Got anything to drink?
- More?
I can make a cup of tea.
- Tea?
Don't be silly.
- There's a bottle of something...
Well, open it!
What are you waiting for?
She'd even drink altar wine.
I'll put it down here.
There's my hen.
How are you?
And the chicks?
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 5...
Only 5?
One's missing.
- Where's my chick?
- What?
There used to be six.
I told you never to touch my things.
What's this disgusting stuff?
Marsala... are you crazy?
It's all I had.
The young lady left it behind.
Here's what I think of your Marsala!
We're open again!
Come on up!
Anyone at home?
No-one here?
They're in, all right.
- Did you ring?
- Sure.
I've been here ages.
Don't bother, there's no electricity.
They said I was being difficult and that they'd use candles.
Go on, ring a candle.
- Do you live here?
- Unfortunately.
- This is for Adua Giovanetti.
- For the boss!
If you had a letter box I could deliver your mail.
Send it by post.
- Here's the letter box.
- I didn't notice.
Goodbye.
- He didn't even see that.
- Stop it now.
- What a pity, they're still in bed.
- That's where you should be.
So it's you.
Welcome back.
- Thanks for the lift.
- That's OK.
Bye.
I'm a friend.
I met her in a bar and brought her home.
Thanks.
She went out to enjoy herself a bit.
I understand.
May I...?
Nice.
You've got a good place here.
- Good idea.
- What idea?
For a restaurant.
Perfect place.
Not too far from the city, secluded, quiet...
- Can I use your phone?
- We haven't even got gas or light.
Tell me, did you already know my friend Marilina?
- Marilina had this for you.
- Throw it down.
Airmail.
I've got bad news for you.
- I'm going.
- Really?
That's awful.
And worse...
I'll be back soon.
- If you really want to.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
And thanks.
My God!
Nine o'clock!
Not bad looking.
Who is he?
Adua, what's the matter?
But it's impossible!
They promised!
What are you talking about?
It was all in order.
Why?
Because the police know who we are.
- They said they'd burn the files.
- They must have lost their matches.
- They're not giving us a licence?
- Great!
Furniture, workmen, rent...
Just as well I only put in 500,000.
- That's a really stupid thing to say.
- What was wrong with it?
They gave Fosca a licence.
We should have applied for a dairy licence.
Yes, and you'd take housemaids upstairs with their bottles of milk.
- Dr Ercoli, please.
- In the salon.
Show these ladies.
You wait here.
I'll speak to him first.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Please sit down.
So here I am.
- The others?
- Down there.
Shall I call them?
No, it's fine.
A dress like that... but not red, what's that new colour?
- Ottanio.
- How refined!
Careful, they're watching us.
I know the one on the right, I've seen her often.
Make the other one turn round.
- Lolita!
- Me?
She's 23.
Firstly, the house and land are in order?
Yes, but we need a licence.
That's nothing, it's the rest that's important.
What possessed you to take a rented house?
You need your head checked!
That way you'll all get cheated.
Well...
- Gicosi.
- Coming, Doctor.
Tomorrow you will sort out the land.
Gicosi will deal with everything.
I've got all the documents ready.
Shall I go to the solicitor?
- Go, go.
- And the other things...?
Other things?
I'll buy the property, you pay me rent.
For the first two months, no men.
Then when the restaurant's going, you can get started.
You'll pay me a million per month.
- A million?
- That's not much.
Girls like you can earn double that.
I'd better talk to the others about it.
It's OK like this.
I've got the house, land, licence, no-one will bother you.
I'll even send you customers.
You just get working.
You can't manage anything on your own.
You're in trouble before you've even started.
Keep in touch with Gicosi.
So... a lemon frappé.
What are you having?
- Strawberry ice cream.
- I'm sure they're wonderful here.
RESTAURANT
Two customers!
Idiot, come away from there!
But didn't it say "restaurant"?
- What are we going to give them?
- There's nothing ready.
- Who'll serve them?
- You.
What do I say?
Service!
Where are they?
Hello, gentlemen, what can I serve you?
- A beer.
- Is that all?
- A beer and two glasses.
- Very funny.
They had a beer, dirtied the cloth and even wanted a date.
Not bad for our first day. 90 lire.
- Look, I've done it.
- Aren't you going to eat the apple?
I don't like apples, I just like peeling them.
What are you laughing about?
I'm thinking of that 90 lire.
And he's expecting a million.
A million a month!
If it's like this every day...
- Hello.
- Hello.
Enjoy your meal, don't let me disturb you.
- But if you really insist...
- A real customer at last.
Watch him, he could sell a car to the boss of Fiat.
So you deal in cars?
Yes, and I've got just the car for you.
A jewel, a beautiful car for a beautiful lady.
It's wonderful... all yellow!
It's so big!
Want to try?
Let's go for a spin.
Who said I needed a car?
No obligation, no-one's forcing you.
It doesn't cost anything to try.
It's a bit big, but we could do with a car here.
Come on Adua, let's buy it.
That's all we need now.
So this is the jewel?
Sure.
Comfortable, practical, smart, easy to drive...
And it's cheap.
So let's go for a drive.
- I'll be back soon.
- Bye.
- I'd buy him as well.
- How does he know Marilina?
- He says he was a friend of Rosy.
- Who's Rosy?
Do I know her?
I don't know.
I worked with a Rosy in Milan.
Has he gone?
Why didn't you tell him to wait for me?
- Silly of me!
- At least you realise it.
Marilina, wait!
Where are you going?
You're not going to leave me here alone!
I'm going to see Stefano and get my money.
Marilina, wait for me!
Just four plates, eh?
There'd be three if she washed her own.
They can't just leave me like this.
Waiter!
Who is it now?
Waiter!
What am I supposed to do now?
What can I give him?
- Why have we stopped?
- Let's smoke a cigarette.
That's what we're doing.
And you're chain-smoking.
Is it to save matches?
I've heard it all, they even ask me if I smoke in my sleep.
Even if I put it out when I'm making love.
And do you put it out?
No.
Look, do you trust me?
Well...
You should trust Piero Salvagni.
I'll tell you what.
I'll leave you the car.
Keep it for a week, a month, a year.
If you like it, keep it.
It's worth a million, yours for 600 thousand.
I'll give it back now.
Think about it.
A cat in a hurry has blind kittens.
If the cat doesn't make up its mind, the mice eat it.
Mice?
Do I look like a mouse?
Look, here's the radio, fan...
And who'd want to eat you?
And the reclining seat.
It comes up like this.
Here's the spray and the wipers.
Yes.
It's true, Piero Salvagni.
I don't trust you.
Not an inch.
I know all about men, I know what you're after.
You look safe but you've got the eyes of a snake.
- And I'm not falling for them.
- First a mouse, now a snake.
You think I do this each time I sell a car?
Not the car... but what you're thinking.
I've been a big girl for a while and I've known plenty like you.
You can play that game with Milly or Lolita, OK?
You're the one I like.
Good choice.
Sounds almost true.
It's true.
What a nerve.
Every word a lie.
You see it like that?
Wait.
Listen, you liar.
Let's get things straight.
This is where it starts and finishes.
Aren't you going to lower the seat?
What does that mean, "100 mugs"?
"100 mugs, 100 caps."
- What's that supposed to mean?
- 100 heads, 100 hats.
It means everyone's different.
When I was training for the police, I studied surveying.
- Did you take your exams in Sardinia?
- No, here on the mainland.
But isn't a surveyor and an engineer the same?
Well, the engineers do the designs and we watch over the work.
- Is there a knife?
- Over there.
Give me one too.
Thanks.
What do you want, Gorgonzola or Gruyere?
- I love Gorgonzola.
- Me, too.
Where I come from, we've got even better cheeses.
They bury them covered in sage, they're ready in three months.
Remember, you're making me a chicken-liver frittata.
Yes, but I told you...
Where I come from, we sauté the livers and add breadcrumbs.
It's much tastier that way.
If you come again I'll make it.
Of course I'll come again, our site is just over there.
I should be at work.
Can I have my bill?
Bill?
You can pay next time.
You're in a hurry now.
Tell me the truth.
How long have you been open?
Not long.
You really want to know?
You're our first customer.
Thanks.
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- I didn't do anything.
So who was it, then?
Thanks for the ride...
In the car, I mean.
Bye, boys.
You know where I live now.
- Be quiet, you fool!
- What's the matter?
Hello.
Goodbye, then.
- You see, I work over there.
- Really near.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You didn't even tell me your name.
I'm Mi...
Caterina.
Caterina Zellero.
What are you doing?
It's far too thick.
Concentrate on the spaghetti, you're acting like a chemist.
- The meat's burning.
- I'm coming.
There's far too much salt.
What do you mean?
I only put in a spoonful.
Who told you to?
I put in two spoonfuls.
Who told you to?
I made the sauce, I added the salt.
- You should have told us.
- Why?
You shouldn't interfere.
Anyone can add salt.
Let me put in the salt, it'll stop you quarrelling.
Done.
You're squabbling like schoolgirls and we have two more customers.
- The steaks and salad?
- Ready.
- Where's the salad?
- In the drainer, of course.
Oh, and we need two more spaghettis.
It needs cooking...
There, on the scales.
- I'm going to sit down.
- Who gives a damn!
- The spaghetti?
- Here.
- Too many cooks in here.
- You just keep quiet.
Do what you like, I'm exhausted.
Good day, daughters, hard at work?
Give me the salad, the steaks are getting cold.
I've only got two hands.
- God bless you all.
- Thanks, Father.
All right, let's do the sauce again.
- Don't try...
- I can do it, I can!
Milly, come here, I can't open this tin.
This damned pig...
It looks like we're cooking for an army.
- Your steak, sir.
- Thank you.
What vegetables have you got?
Sorry?
Could I have a salad with rocket and radishes?
And some thinly-sliced cucumber and a tomato...
- We've haven't got any.
- No tomato?
We haven't got the other things either.
- So what vegetables have you got?
- The lettuce is finished.
An artichoke?
Raw...
- Some mozzarella, then.
- All right.
I'm sorry sir, we haven't even got any mozzarella.
Not even mozzarella?
Could I have some fruit, then?
- A nice apple?
- All right, an apple.
Lolita, listen.
This is a restaurant.
- For the time being, at least.
- And...?
And try not to wiggle your bum so much.
I saw her winking at a customer.
I didn't wink, his wife was there.
I was smiling politely.
Can't we even smile?
- Yes, but smile properly.
- What a fuss.
- I've never worked as a waitress.
- Where's the mineral water?
Milly, your customer's arrived.
Now we've lost her.
Look, I made it again today.
But if you'd rather have something else...
No, I'm kidding.
It's my favourite.
- First course?
- Spaghetti.
It's ready.
Then I'll bring your favourite.
Tomorrow, I'll try adding some onion.
Will you let me do your hair?
- Please.
- What a bore.
I saw a lovely style in a fashion magazine.
- What's wrong with it?
- Everything.
Even the gears...
He's ripped you off, I told you so.
Don't be cheeky!
It's not easy to rip me off.
I'm not Lolita.
Leave the poor thing out of it this time.
Stefano's giving her back her money tomorrow, isn't he?
Yes, and don't joke about it.
He's out of town now, his landlady told me.
- He was hiding in the toilet.
- He's in Sicily with the company.
Where he'll find another idiot like you to play his showgirl.
Better to play the showgirl than work as a servant.
The work was easier before.
That's what I said.
When are we going to start again?
Less tiring...
And I like it more.
Where can I wash?
I'd like to wash my hands.
- There's a sink over there.
- Thanks.
Shall we play with him?
Ladies... onstage!
Give me that money!
You're in trouble this time.
You can't cheat me like that, I'll teach you!
- OK, stop it now.
- Are you hurt?
- Want something?
A brandy?
- No, why?
A glass of water.
I don't know...
Something about a flat, 200,000...
Mr Salvagni.
Commander!
How are you?
- The car?
- It's just coming.
You're so punctual!
Here it is!
Come along.
You're here.
Listen, you clown, let's get this straight.
You keep quiet, I'll do the talking.
Don't you want to sell it?
Commander, come here.
Watch how I deal with him.
Madame, leave it here, the policeman's a friend of mine.
Officer, it's all right, I know the lady.
Madame, allow me to introduce Commander Massano.
Let's have a look at it.
Isn't it a gem?
Look, the paintwork is perfect.
It's magnificent.
And new brakes.
And look at the upholstery!
The lady wants to sell because she's ordered a later model.
You've got to try it, it's a marvel.
Tell the Commander how it drives.
- It's really...
- There, what did I say?
It's a status symbol, just the car for you.
- What about petrol consumption?
- You're joking!
Tell him, don't let him hear it just from me.
Not a lot, about 4 kilometres a litre...
- Four?
- She means miles, it's an American car.
Four miles, about seven kilometres, just like a Fiat 1100.
I swear, it's a bargain you'll thank me for.
Anyway, we'll try it out.
Just let me find the lady a taxi.
Have a coffee while you're waiting, it's paid for.
Goodbye, Commander.
Only a moment, Officer.
My compliments.
What smooth talking!
- You've got to be smart in my job.
- So I've seen.
- Look, Adua, do you like this one?
- No, why?
You gave me 400 thousand for that one, this is worth much more.
I'll give it in exchange.
Doctor, I'm taking this one.
- Get in, it's yours
- I don't want it.
Try it.
Give it back if you don't like it.
Then you'll give me a Vespa in exchange.
This one is perfect for you.
Come on, start it up.
It goes like a Ferrari.
What's the matter?
You've got to trust me, understand?
You and me, eh?
Go, go.
I'll come and see you down at the restaurant.
Bye.
We're just going.
Commander, here I am.
Here's the starter...
Handbrake...
Indicator...
- Is that you?
- Hi there!
- Here, catch!
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.
Open it.
- What is it?
Hey, it won't explode.
100,000 lire, nothing to fear.
I made 200 from your old banger.
100 each.
So are you coming down or am I coming up?
I'll come down.
- How much?
- 850.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, miss.
Good night.
Come on, Carletto.
We're here.
We'll go to bed now.
Keep quiet.
Is that you, Marilina?
Hi there.
Just as well you're back, we've had so many customers.
- How's your little boy?
- Well.
Thanks for asking.
But you've brought him here?
Evening...
Did you see?
She's brought the boy.
Be good, OK?
Pyjamas...
- So you brought him here?
- As you can see.
- Poor thing.
Are you sleepy?
- Leave him alone.
He doesn't know you.
- You'll frighten him like that.
- Quiet, I'm trying to sleep.
Good idea.
What possessed you?
- Couldn't you leave him with the nanny?
- This is my house, paid with my money.
So I'll bring anyone I want.
I've only seen him ten times.
At least for a few days.
You're not getting up to anything.
It's like a convent here.
You go to sleep now.
What's going on here?
Behaving like a landlady, and she hasn't paid a penny.
- I'll do what I want too, sometimes.
- I paid 500,000.
- What's the matter with her?
- She's brought her kid.
What kid?
Marilina, he's crying.
Have you got tummy ache?
No.
Why?
What was I doing?
Talking?
Did I wake you up?
Go to sleep now.
- Why aren't you asleep?
- The light's on.
- Do you always sleep in the dark?
- Light's expensive.
- What's this?
You've got a bump.
- I don't know.
Let me see.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
You must sleep now.
Ah, the light.
I can't sleep in the dark...
Oh, God.
Are you afraid?
Give me your hand.
Put the meat under there.
They can bring the fruit later.
What are you doing here?
What a state you're in!
- Where's your mummy?
- She's asleep.
You take care of him.
Oh, poor thing!
37.7, almost 38.
And such a headache.
I'm all alone here.
Are you busy, Adua?
Really?
Please, just this once.
And you can bring me some cigarettes, too.
Hurry up!
OK, I'll come over.
Before all hell breaks loose here.
I'll be right back.
He says he's ill.
Don't forget the fish, Carmela can help you.
He's here.
He was hungry.
Jesus.
Couldn't you wake me up?
I got such a fright.
Come in quickly, it's so cold here.
- What's the matter with you?
- Pain in the shoulder, I feel bad.
- You've caught cold
- Or a chill.
Chill?
It might be pleurisy.
You know what the pleura is?
It's that membrane round the lungs.
It starts here... and it hurts here.
- Have you taken anything?
- Aspirin, pills, nose drops...
And three packets of cigarettes.
What have you brought me?
Hey, are you mad?
Do you want to kill me?
A friend of mine had the same thing.
He got over it in two hours.
I can't remember what he took for it.
Who does your cleaning?
I'll call him now.
I sold him a Giulietta Sprint, a real bargain.
Hello?
Dr Renzi?
He's out of the office?
Give me the director, it's urgent.
He's with the director, a real big shot.
Dr Renzi, it's Piero, Piero Salvagni.
How's the car?
I told you it was a bargain.
All right, I understand.
I'm coming!
It's such a mess in here.
What does it matter?
You always leave me alone.
Where have you been?
What did your friend say?
Who?
He didn't remember.
I'm really ill.
I don't understand what anyone's saying.
No, he's out
I said he wasn't in.
Do what you like, then.
Who told you to do that?
It's none of your business!
Can't I be left in peace in my own home?
One day I'll...
What's got into you?
What'll you do?
Nothing, what do you think?
I didn't mean it.
If only I was on my own.
Are you married?
Are you crazy?
That was my mother.
When I remember, I send her money.
She wants to know everything I do, where I've been.
I tell her a pack of lies.
Sometimes I forget what I said the day before.
Always hanging round my neck!
Listen to this disc I bought yesterday!
Those trains.
How do you stand it?
They keep me company.
I like the noise.
Listen to that!
Keep covered.
Does it hurt?
Yes, it's starting again.
Will you give me a massage?
Down a bit.
There!
I'm so cold.
Come into bed and warm me up a bit.
- No.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
- What's the matter now?
Turn round.
Strange.
I feel shy with you.
Adua!
Modugno's here!
- The singer?
- Yes, Modugno!
Just as well you're back, we're snowed under.
- He liked the frittata.
He wants more.
- It's finished.
Your sardine must be tired of eating it every day.
Perhaps he won't come today.
He'll come.
And he's not a sardine, he's a Sardinian.
And he's a customer, just like the others.
Just give me a hand here.
18 customers, all these plates to do.
The meat's on the stove, we've got to wash the salad, but I'm going.
Need a hand?
I'll wash the salad.
I always do it at the convent.
When he talks it's different from when he sings.
Brother Michele washing the salad!
I'm earning the pig's dinner.
He's fattening up nicely.
Do you think she'll make it as a singer?
Another one!
What a fine family!
Nice place you've got.
And the food's good.
Thanks, Mr Modugno.
We'll do even better next time.
We've only just opened.
You should do pasta with sardines.
Of course, I'll tell the cook.
You see, she hasn't quite got the warmth...
I put it in the boot of the car.
Run and fetch it.
Good idea.
We've been waiting 10 minutes for our first course.
I'll go and see.
Decide what you want for the main course, better order it now.
Milly, did you see him?
- Modugno?
Of course.
- No, the lawyer there, with his wife.
Yes, it's him, he always used to come.
Excuse me, where can I wash my hands?
Outside, on the right.
I'll be back in a minute.
When do we get some food?
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
I hoped...
I thought you didn't recognise me.
What a surprise to see you here!
What are you doing?
You see?
We've got a restaurant.
Come off it.
With a waitress like that?
- Isn't that...
- Caterina.
No..."Golden Thighs"...
Milly!
I get it.
I think I'll be coming here often.
Without my wife, of course.
You can bring your wife, we haven't started upstairs.
Better if she doesn't know the way here.
- Aren't you going to wash your hands?
- I don't need to.
Small world.
- Haven't they brought anything?
- It'll come sometime.
Some bread, even.
Bad idea of yours to stop here.
And the food won't be any good.
He's going to sing!
I'll dedicate this song to all proud lovers.
He's a tenor, isn't he?
I want some, too.
Just a sip.
It's not good for you.
Father?
To get baptised...
What's the maximum age you can do it?
Baptism?
Aren't you baptised?
I am, but...
The boy?
So what are you waiting for?
When he was born I was ill.
And you know how things get put off.
You were ill.
Couldn't his father arrange it?
There's always time.
Jesus was baptised when he was 30.
- There you are.
- But we chose one with frosted glass.
It's much nicer if you can see what's inside.
What are we going to put in it?
Everything.
Meat here, vegetables there...
Wine, fish, fruit... the lot!
It's beautiful.
What's he telling her out there?
He hasn't shut his mouth for a second.
Look at his face!
He won't repay her.
"Stefano, Stefano!" What a hope.
You, me, Grazia, Doris, two actors, some dancing...
This meat's good, isn't it?
- Excellent.
- And we'll have Toto Brusca.
- Who's that?
- You don't know who Toto Brusca is?
Tell her, Calypso.
You're out of touch.
He won the Salerno Festival.
They were all after him, but I got in first.
Show her the contract.
- It's all right, I believe you.
- Pass the salad.
How's the salad?
Tender?
- Wonderful.
- We've got all of Wanda's new costumes.
- Remember that act "Pink Samba"?
- Yes, that year I went with Osiris.
We'll use them when you do your turn with Calypso.
- Me... with him?
- You haven't seen him on stage.
Not classical stuff... but there's no-one to beat his modern dancing.
Show her the photo.
This salad would be perfect with some anchovy.
- I'll get some if you like.
- Perhaps later, with some cheese.
Did you notice the bouquet of this wine?
- Exquisite!
- He looks OK in tails.
Listen, Lolita, I know what I'm doing.
And I'm a big name in the South.
When they see "Bamboo and his Troupe" they're happy to buy tickets.
One night in Bari they had to call the police.
We start in Palermo on the 25th.
We're booked all over Sicily.
20 days in Naples.
We'll make two million in three months.
And you'll stay here as a waitress?
You've invested 500,000?
Give me that 500,000 come back to the theatre, you'll have your daily pay.
You'll earn back all the money you gave me.
- As a lady, not a servant.
- Yes, a servant.
That's all I am here.
I'll take my money and go back to the theatre.
Don't forget the anchovies!
- You think 500,000 is enough?
- Even 400.
If we go down any more, we'll end with 10,000.
I've made up my mind, I'm going back to the theatre.
I'm leaving and I want my money back.
Just when it's going well?
You want to make things difficult?
I don't care, it's my money.
I gave you 500,000.
Give it back or I'll go to a lawyer, I'll take you to court.
Go upstairs.
We'll talk later.
You bitch!
I want my money!
Just keep out of the way.
I want my money!
You see?
She's OK, her friends are the problem.
Wiping your plate?
They'll really think you're dying of hunger.
We won't get a penny here.
- You think we'd better...
- It's the best thing...
Did you ask for your bill?
We were guests.
I'm the only person here who has guests.
We've been your guests, then.
Thank you.
So you've had a free meal and we've avoided being fleeced.
No, look... call Lolita.
Don't worry, I'll speak to Lolita.
- There's some mistake here.
- No mistake.
Come on.
3,600 lire.
Robbers!
- Come on, join us.
- No.
- Don't be like that!
- No.
Do I have to say sorry?
She's so obstinate!
Open your mouth.
It's sugar.
It's not sugar.
- I renounce him.
- I renounce him.
- Who are we renouncing?
- Satan.
I'm the only lay brother in the convent, I do all the cooking, cleaning...
- Here's the cake.
- It's too much for me.
Get some poor person to help.
- Here's the cake.
Congratulations!
- Who made it?
Milly?
She's too busy thinking about her boyfriend.
Adua bought it this morning.
- Here, take it.
- Thanks, Auntie!
Go easy, you'll squash him.
When I met you it was just a shell...
nearly three months ago.
Three months on Thursday...
I think.
I've eaten hundreds of frittatas.
Don't be offended, but I've got to confess...
My mother often used to make it, but I don't really like frittata with liver.
Why did you eat it, then?
Because it was you that cooked it.
Do you mind?
No.
I just wish I'd realised.
And didn't you notice I came on Sundays.
No-one was working here.
I live in Primavalle.
But I drove 12 kilometres...
A cigarette?
You see...
I felt at home when I came.
Until my mother died two years ago, I used to go home each summer.
You see, Caterina...
I haven't been feeling so lonely.
I'd see you twice a day.
And your friends are nice too.
In about a month we'll be finished here.
Where will you be working?
Won't you come to us again?
Oh, yes, in the evenings.
But I was thinking...
I mean... wouldn't it be better if I didn't have to come?
What do you mean, "didn't have to..."?
Well... if you agree... of course you'll need to think about it...
I've never talked like this before.
How do you ask a girl if...
Yes, if she wants to get married.
I haven't got a smart house like this, with three bathrooms.
I told you, I live in Primavalle.
But we could get a TV... in instalments.
Or we can always go the cinema.
There's no hurry.
I've been doing all the talking.
Give me your answer in your own time.
I'm sorry, Emilio, it's impossible.
I'll never forget.
Thank you.
But why?
Tell me why.
I knew you wanted to tell me something.
It kept me awake at night.
I hoped... but I was afraid...
Why?
Nothing you say will make any difference.
I know what life's like.
No, let me go.
Is there someone else?
No.
Not the way you mean.
But there have been lots.
We aren't school friends.
If you must know, we worked together in the same houses, same towns.
We were on the game.
Do you understand?
Happy now?
You forced me to say it.
Just as well.
What was I thinking of?
Just as well.
I was right, you see.
There are things you can't understand.
It's not always "100 heads, 100 hats".
You're not saying anything?
Who'd marry a girl like me?
You think you could introduce me to your friends?
Think of it!
Well, don't you think it's funny?
I do.
You asked for my hand... as though you were talking to my mother.
And don't come to the restaurant again.
- Who do you think I look like?
- A tart.
Spiteful bitch.
You're always so insulting.
Don't you think I look like Anita Ekberg?
Spitting image!
Go and change now, they'll be coming soon.
- You're back early.
- I've been out too long.
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that now?
Out of the way, you don't know how.
We've got to start working properly.
- This isn't proper work?
- Yes, ruining our hands in the kitchen.
Is that any better than the other job?
You like making soup?
I'm sick of it, if that's all right with you.
I want to go back home.
- Did we lose?
- It didn't even cross the line.
- Weren't you watching?
- So many smart people here.
It's a real aristocratic gathering.
See that man over there?
- Which one?
- Him.
He's the Prince of San Marino.
- Which one?
!
- The one selling ice cream.
You're crazy.
Go on, choose a dog.
- Like before?
- With the luck we've had?
Can I have a light?
We'll go for Abukir.
Let's put on 10,000 lira together.
Just don't run away with the money.
Do I look the type who would?
No, but once Lolita had 10,000 lira stolen from her.
You take it then, open your own account.
Can't you take a joke?
- Let's bet together, then.
- Do you think I don't trust you?
Go!
If anyone bothers you, say you're with Piero Salvagni.
Look who it is!
What are you doing here?
I want to win a few million so I can buy you a present.
- Big spender!
- Are you alone?
You think I go out alone at night?
I'm with Ulisse.
So, you're well settled.
Ulisse is more of a gentleman than you.
Call me, you'll see what a gentleman I can be.
Will you call me?
Not bad, eh?
It's busy here.
That's a good sign.
Sure it's the right place?
Of course. "Adua's".
Look.
Look!
Yes, now I see.
Ercoli's always right.
When I'm in Rome he sends me somewhere good.
- Are you alone?
- Very alone.
- Inside or outside?
- It's better over there.
No?
Someone wants to know how you do the scampi.
I said I'd let her know when you're in a better mood.
I'm not in a bad mood.
Or if I am, it's your fault.
Yes, it's always our fault.
- Whose fault is it, then?
- There are two men...
Listen.
Ercoli sent them, they want to go upstairs.
It was too good to be true.
Now we've got to go upstairs for the first pig that turns up.
Adua isn't even here tonight.
She's playing sweethearts.
If they want to eat we're here to serve them.
For the other thing, tell them to come back when we're all here.
- Two nice boys, at least.
- You didn't choose them before.
Don't be difficult about it.
What are you doing?
If it's so important, she can go.
Go on, what are you waiting for?
Get upstairs.
You sent her upstairs.
One of us had to.
Shut up!
What's he done?
Mind your own business.
When the frittata's ready, can I have one without liver?
My fruit, please?
Who are you?
Who are you, little boy?
- I'm Carletto.
- He's Marilina's son.
- Shall I fetch someone?
- Don't bother.
Indian Vendetta.
It's a Western.
- I like Westerns.
- They're for children.
Valley of the Beavers.
That could be interesting.
Fancy it?
Yes.
Why not?
It's the landlord.
I'll see you at lunchtime.
- But we haven't chosen a film.
- Yes, the Valley of the Whatsits.
Good day, Doctor.
I'll get Adua immediately.
Wait here for me.
Good day, Doctor.
- Will you sit down here?
- No.
Let's have a look upstairs.
- But it's a mess.
- Doesn't matter.
Don't you knock?
Had a good look?
I'm sending Antonietta tomorrow.
Remember her?
She was at Virginia's.
She can do the cooking.
Have you seen yourselves in the mirror?
The other night I sent a client.
He had good things to say about you lot... as waitresses.
We haven't really got going.
It's still early days.
This needs tidying up.
The restaurant's going fine.
Get rid of the kids, the strangers and sacks of potatoes in the bedrooms.
Get to work.
I can't.
I'm getting married.
Congratulations!
This doesn't make any difference.
I don't give a damn about your private lives.
You don't think she'd stay here and work for you if she's married!
We had an agreement.
I didn't invest all my money to open a rehabilitation centre.
I've already waited a month.
Get married, become nuns, do what you like but you've got to stay here and pay what we agreed.
A million a month!
Goodbye!
We pay the rent!
- We'll make the rest when it suits us.
- If it suits us!
You have 24 hours to decide.
If not, you're out of here tomorrow!
- We're not moving.
It's our house!
- It's all ours!
It's all mine.
The house and everything in it.
You'll clear out of here.
And I mean what I say.
I'll report you, you understand?
He can't do anything.
The licence is in my name!
I got it and I can take it away.
A restaurant can't be run by women like you.
You have police records.
Understand what that means?
Sort it out.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Stormy weather, eh?
Are you angry with someone?
With everybody!
It's this crap world!
Don't say that.
You should pray, daughter.
Praying makes you a better person.
Of course!
So when I've become a good person, someone who hasn't been praying comes along and rips me off.
You lot preach...
talk Latin... say Mass...
- But what do you know about life?
- Of course, life is a sacrifice...
Do you know what the four of us were?
What we used to do?
It doesn't matter what you were.
What matters is what you are and will be...
I'll tell you what we will be...
exactly what we were!
Why?
Because that's how it is.
Even if we prayed on our knees for ten years.
And what do you do?
What can you do?
Come on, show me!
You can only say, "God's will be done".
How dare you speak like that in front of this child?
Hold your tongue!
I'm sorry, Father Michele.
I needed to get it out.
I hope you feel better...
Goodbye.
I'll pray for you.
Thank you.
Do you know what, Carletto?
Tomorrow, you'll go away with Carmela.
Back to your nanny.
Are you happy?
I want to stay here.
We have the right to stay here.
I want to work here till I get married.
And maybe even afterwards.
Even if I never make love again, I'd rather die than do it with that pig!
Shut up!
You'll wake up the child!
Think it's fair I can't keep the child so that bastard can earn money?
I'm going to smash his head in tomorrow!
- Who could it be at this time?
- Probably some drunk.
Who's there?
Wait, I'll be right down!
Who is it?
- Is it Thursday today?
- So?
A client owed me money, I'd forgotten all about it.
He's brought me the money so I can go straight to the bank tomorrow.
Do you work even at night?
Of course!
You're work too!
It's a dog's life, I tell you!
Oh, my cigarettes...
Wait here, OK?
He said I was old...
but it's him that's queer.
I was afraid you'd be out...
Why did you come down?
Sorry, my mother is here...
She's sleeping.
I tried to ring you all day.
I've been very busy.
What's wrong?
What's happened?
Got a light?
You didn't come all this way for a light, did you?
I'm not in a joking mood.
- They're kicking us out!
- From where?
The restaurant.
Did Milly poison someone with her mushrooms?
This morning we had a row with the landlord.
He says we should keep our agreement.
But the restaurant is doing fine now.
It's thanks to us.
It's a job that lasts, that you can do also later.
Later when?
Later...
when we're not young any more.
And then there's Marilina's child, Milly's getting married...
What can we do, Piero?
You are asking me, Adua, my love?
What do I know?
How can I help you?
I don't even know him.
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
What's that got to do with it?
Wouldn't you prefer it if I just had the restaurant?
Wouldn't it be better?
So why should we start again like before?
Did you see the one that just went past?
I don't want to end up like that.
Why?
But you haven't been...?
Go on.
No, I'm saying...
I'm not talking about you.
But...
Marilina...
I thought that...
No?
I don't know.
I must have made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
What did I say, Adua?
Know what we'll do?
We'll sort things out tomorrow.
I'll go and talk to him, eh?
I'll talk to him myself.
And what are you going to tell him?
That you agree with him?
That things are fine like that?
Because you all agree, eh?
You, him and all the others!
And what are we?
We're branded like cattle!
Piero!
Piero, aren't you coming back in?
Calm down, he's coming.
And you can keep your Piero.
He's all yours!
It's not what you think.
She came with my mother.
She's an orphan.
Come up and see for yourself.
Adua...
Stop!
What's going on?
To hell with you!
That's all I need.
The whole world is against me.
Look, I've even hurt myself.
What do you all want from me?
I'm almost 35.
I have the right to...
He's here!
Open the door!
What are you doing?
What are we going to say?
You've got to talk to him.
Open up, Adua!
Come down!
I'll tell him you're coming down.
Hurry up!
Adua's coming down.
Thank you, there's no hurry.
This is fine.
Dr Ercoli, is this OK with you?
I have my working clothes on.
We're ready.
From this moment on, the bedrooms are open to the public.
Come on, gentlemen.
Don't be afraid of the police!
We have an excellent protector!
Isn't that right, Dr Ercoli?
Happy now?
This is the way we should work, isn't it?
Isn't this what you wanted?
You, sir, do you want to come up?
If you don't like me, you can choose one of my colleagues.
Come on, you don't have to marry them!
Girls, get down to work.
You have to make Dr Ercoli rich.
And remember, we're not waitresses.
We're whores.
It's all we're allowed to do here.
- Nothing else.
- She's mad!
What are you doing?
Are you leaving already?
Don't you want to check your profits?
Do you want to smoke?
Thank you.
Hey, gorgeous.
Your free ticket home.
You're still a bachelor.
If you want to get married...
We wanted to send him to prison, the professional with a clean record, and instead...
Give me a paper, please.
- Here you are.
- No, II Tempo.
Here's II Tempo.
Hot off the press.
The brothel was disguised as a restaurant...
They even have our pictures.
It's strange.
I've never been up so early before.
It's beautiful.
We did a very good job with it, eh?
Hello, Emilio, it's Caterina...
But...
Emilio!
Sorry.
Thank you.
Wasn't he there?
He's not there.
He's gone away.
Maybe he really has gone away.
Don't you think?
Of course.
He told me himself on the phone.
I recognised his voice!
Why?
You'd already told him everything.
Yes, but he was the only one to know then.
Now we're in all the papers.
I can understand him.
Ah, yes...
You defend even him now!
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
It's nothing to do with you.
If you hadn't done it, I would have.
And maybe I'd have even broken Ercoli's neck.
Pity, Ercoli's lost a glass.
And a plate.
Yes, come on!
Come on!
One evening we had 80 people eating.
It's hard work but it's very satisfying.
Do you understand?
- I understand.
- Tell her about Modugno!
One day, Modugno came in!
He told me I was good.
He wanted to teach me how to cook pasta with sardines!
I'm not like one of them.
What do you think I'm doing here?
Have you been drinking tonight?
I'm only here to make money.
I already have some.
I've seen a place which is just perfect.
The garden's small.
But the kitchen is so big!
Are you deaf?
Have you found a cook?
Take Adriana.
She can cook you up some dishes.
Shut up!
You old drunkard!
No, I won't end up like you!
I can't!
I can't!
CROESUS
Won't deny myself a treat!
All set.
The "bleeding" butcher's knife.
Its sharp blade is solidly mounted with rosette rivets on a top quality beech handle.
The "slaughter" master knife-chopper.
Serves as a cleaver and a knife.
What a thing!
"Joan of Arc."
"Broken Eggs."
Made of white porcelain.
"Three Graces."
"Crouching Venus."
And naked.
"Love...
"and Psyche." Exactly.
I read it right.
"By Canova at the Louvre."
"Old Sevres style."
What could that mean?
Gosh, I have used the lamp signal for 3 days.
Old Sevres style.
Sweet love.
She won't be long.
One km in 15 minutes.
It won't take more.
She'll be here in 15 minutes...
Old Sevres style.
What is it?
Already?
You used our signal, didn't you?
One km in 1 minute.
How can you walk at 60 km/h?
I wasn't at home.
I was on the crest.
- What were you doing there?
- My feet were cold.
- And you warmed them up there?
- No.
I was waiting for the signal.
Now, my feet are frozen.
With my husband, I didn't need to stand outside.
Always the same old song.
Right!
If he weren't dead...
- So what?
- I'd be in bed with him.
- I'm cold.
Take me in your arms.
- Easy!
I hate the cold.
- Go by the stove
- The fire's dead.
Your husband, the fire...
Everyone's dead but me.
- Be patient.
- It ain't easy with cold feet.
My feet are cold too.
I don't rush to people's home for all that.
I grant you extra 5 min.
See!
I'm not selfish.
Have you heard of
- Old Sevres style?
- No, never.
- I'll show you.
- You expect me to take the bait?
There's no bait to take.
It's in the book.
My husband never lured me with any bait.
- He was smart as one, though.
- What do you mean?
Let's not get philosophical.
Gilles.
Gilles?
- Gilles?
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- How's the weather?
- I can't say.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
It's cold.
Your chimney isn't smoking.
- How could it, since I'm here?
- It should, though.
- Do you want me to leave?
- Chimneys ought to smoke.
If we were married, it would.
Marriage doesn't make the world go round, but we do.
- Who?
You?
- Yes, me.
Look!
For you, dear goats.
I'm not a chimney but I matter too.
Can you belch out smoke every morning?
Neither mornings nor evenings.
But I'll make the world go round too.
I can't wait to see it.
It'll be nice.
I can't say the same.
What do you mean?
I'm working, that's all.
I go about my business.
Yeah right.
And for a little luxury, you use the lamp signal...
and I come.
Silly me!
If that's luxury, you aren't hard to please.
It might change, though.
Do you want to get married?
Let's get this straight.
You said you did at first.
You know how it is.
I didn't mean it.
And what do you mean now?
We're fine.
Why would we change it?
How convenient!
I'm a slave.
Don't be ridiculous.
You come and stay for a while.
You spend the evening with me.
It's very common.
Many books talk about women spending evenings at a friend's.
It's no slavery.
It's over.
Until you'll see our signal.
I wouldn't be so sure.
- You'll eventually get married.
- Definitely.
I'll see then.
Tonight, I'll let the lamp by the window.
Look!
Paul!
What a bastard!
He's mean lazy, stupid and proud.
How nice to see him!
Congrats, Paul.
You badmouthed me so often, that you got me expelled from the valley.
Now, I'm stuck up there, freezing my ass up.
Look!
There's Edouard.
What a crook!
Still the same big belly.
Don't you dare come near.
Stay away!
Look where I am.
Look where you sent me.
Don't deny it.
You made sure that I was driven away.
Yet, I sat up with your dad!
I was also in love with your sister 10 years ago.
But luckily, she turned me down.
It saved me from marrying a crook family.
Who's this one?
Who is he?
Now, they let foreigners...
It might be this murderer of some sort who rented the Rock Barn.
I won't miss any opportunity to bug you.
Trust me!
Where did my sheep go?
A bomb?
Good God!
They're leaking the bomb!
They're crazy!
My sheep are lost.
And I'm not any better.
Bloody Paul and Edouard!
Expelling me wasn't enough.
You had to get me killed.
You knew about the bomb.
Or maybe not.
No, they didn't know.
They never came up here.
They're too lazy?
You didn't know about the bomb, did you?
Well, I'll let you know.
I told you I wouldn't miss any chance to bug you.
This time has come.
Let's go.
MANUFRANCE MAIL ORDER CATALOGUE
Frozen bomb.
"Pan for." What does that mean?
"Stewpot for fat." I'm not fat!
"Pan for"! "Pan for"...
See page 575.
There it is.
"Pan for pies and little pastries"...
Canalization, cutting knife, canon."
Canon!
That could be handy.
I have already a rifle, though.
"Party canon, party popper." Irrelevant!
Mortars and canons for public celebrations.
Absolutely safe mortars and canons.
"Absolutely safe"...
I like that.
Unhindered recoil.
That's exactly it.
I want to recoil unhindered.
"We do it well and you know it."
I might not do it well, but I'll let them know.
Silly me!
Small shot ain't enough.
It should be 3 times that size.
I don't have any.
Or I should fire at point blank range.
But then, no more Jules.
Let's have a look.
What a big bomb!
It could destroy a house.
Two houses!
Three houses even.
Let's try the groundhog trap.
It'll make a bloody racket.
Who's the idiot who fired at me?
Typical!
There's always a knot when you want to pull the string.
Goddamnit!
There.
Bloody hole!
That's a big one.
Well.
That scared the shit out of me!
Dynamite.
It's cold.
It could explode.
I'm afraid it might.
Don't be afraid, Jules.
If only I could control it.
Be brave.
It didn't explode.
Of course.
Dynamite's common now.
If it were dangerous...
What is it?
Five thousand...
Five thousand what?
Five thousand francs.
Holy Jesus!
Oh my!
There must be 2m?
of them.
It's full of dough!
They're safe now.
Is it the signal or a star?
It's a star.
Where is this bloody lamp?
Crap!
What a mess!
Milk and bread.
Bloody damn food!
Of course.
What are you doing here?
Are you going to war?
Crap!
What about the signal, then?
The signal!
Shit!
God, you're polite tonight!
Didn't you want me to come?
Well...
I have a toothache.
I'll help you get rid of it.
I don't think it'll do.
That's actually what caused my toothache.
- You're acting oddly.
- I always do when my teeth ache.
Who's in your bed?
In my bed?
No one.
What kind of question is that?
Someone, in my bed!
- My bed's sacred!
- Well, not for me.
Sure, but you're the only one.
Please say it again.
- I do.
- Do you hear, Rose?
It's not Rose.
I don't care about her.
- Say it again.
- I don't care about Rose.
Put your arm around my waist.
Repeat everything I say.
Rose, you're a dirty wench!
Rose, you're a dirty wench.
Should I make it worse?
No need.
I only say the truth.
- So do I.
- I'll pull her hair out.
Don't.
You're scared, aren't you?
- Of course.
- It must be Marguerite, then.
I told you there's no one.
And I don't trust you.
She's not from here.
You put a helmet to impress her.
- Open, or I'll wreck havoc.
- Go on.
There are little pots on the shelves
- You can break them.
- I don't care about your pots.
I found something better...
The cupboard!
Not these ones.
They belonged to my mom.
What can I do, Dad?
War is war.
- I heard you.
- It's not for me, but if my mom heard you, she'd say the plates belonged to her aunt.
- Tell me who that is.
- Who?
The woman in your bed.
It's not Rose, it's not Marguerite,
- it's nobody.
- Careful, I'll get your brandy.
Go.
It'll do you good.
Get a large bottle with the wheelbarrow.
Take your time.
You wished I'd leave.
No, I like your company.
I'll spend the night here.
What are you doing, Jules?
I'm going to bed, since you stay overnight.
- With her?
- Who else?
- She's here anyway.
- Not in front of me.
There's a door between us.
What are you doing?
Well...
Nobody can tell really.
How dare you laugh?
I'm not laughing.
She's tickling me.
- Jules!
- What?
Jules, I'll dig this hole for you, 'cause I need cash and I have to work.
But if I were rich, I'd bet you my bottom dollar...
If you were rich, you wouldn't bet your dollar, you would hide it.
Dig on this side.
If I were rich, I wouldn't dig on this side.
- No?
- No.
I would on that side.
I wouldn't dig at all even... unless you tell me what this hole is for.
- I told you!
- I don't believe you.
You're exactly like your mom said you were:
"Battistin isn't suspicious, he's stupid."
I told you 50 times I want an American tank
- to filter my water.
- Oh my!
What are you all doing here?
And you?
- I'm curious.
- Mind your own business.
Easy.
I don't care about it.
I'm busy reading and sewing.
What are you doing, Battistin?
A water tank.
It's a small tank, isn't it?
He's right, Jules.
And he already has one.
He's right, Jules.
Ask him why he wants a second one.
He's right, Jules.
Why?
Paul, when you kicked your sister out, because...
I didn't bother you with figures!
- Oh my!
- I was sure you'd come.
- You did come too.
- I'm working.
- Is it a silo?
- It's a water tank.
If it's a silo, the bottom has to slope.
- It's a tank.
- That's what I'm saying.
A slope.
Or, your beets will be crushed.
Old Man Burle!
You better mind your own business.
If you don't watch your daughter, she might leave with 4 Italian lumberjacks.
I see what you mean, but it ain't enough.
Make the slope a little steeper.
You should dig on this side.
Battistin, I'm the one who pays.
I give orders.
Don't dig on this side, but on that one.
Tell him that his tank will be crooked.
Tell him his face is already crooked.
- Whose face is crooked?
- Get lost.
Easy.
I was wounded in the war.
Yeah right, brain damaged.
Your aunt was already climbing trees like a monkey when having fits.
Wounded in the war.
No kidding!
You should be paying a pension to the state for letting you live for 4 years among normal people.
- Oh my!
- You're no better!
Isn't it time for you to die with your life annuity?
- You're old enough!
- What a fuss!
Should I remind you what happened last year?
At the fair on August 6?
- Wow!
- Go to hell!
You made a real fuss then.
So give me a break!
Battistin, I want the hole for today.
Today.
Today?
Don't be so sure.
The future belongs to no one but God.
Do you know who said that?
- Victor Hugo.
- I don't give a damn.
You can't say that.
Still, I don't give a damn.
Look...
I came to you 'cause you're good at building modern things.
You built a toilet flush for Mr. Cassagne.
Well, this water tank needs a flush too.
- It's an invention.
- An invention?
Soon enough, I'll tell you the secret.
You'll be able to build such tanks everywhere.
But I don't want anyone else to know about it.
You can count on me.
I'll finish it quickly.
A water tank with a flush.
Awesome.
This cover ain't junk.
It weighs 5 kg at least.
And 4 to carry...
Back to zero.
There are lots of zeros on 5,000 f notes.
Fool!
You can multiply zeros too.
There...
Sorry, Dad.
Fine...
But how do you multiply them?
I got it wrong.
It can't be that much.
I must have made a mistake.
That's a lot, though.
She killed one.
She killed one again.
Come in.
Hello, sorry to disturb you.
Hello, Jules.
Come in.
- What did you do to this kid?
- I punished him.
When I said Louis XVI had his head cut, he didn't care.
Now I shot a sparrow and he yelled his head off.
He must learn to make allowances.
It's a thrush.
- No, it's a fieldfare.
- You're right, Jules.
- Look at the black feathers.
- Yes, Miss.
Copy 3 times "I mixed a fieldfare with a thrush."
Who confuses fieldfares with thrushes ends in the poorhouse.
A fieldfare is worth 12 f.
A thrush is worth 7.
- My dad sells them 10 f.
- I'm not surprised.
Stand up.
- Ten francs?
- Yes, to Mr. Cassagne.
Forget your punishment.
Two francs aren't worth it.
What do you want?
I need to talk to you about the number zero.
What about it?
- How do you multiply it?
- I taught you that.
Between what you taught me and what I learnt,
I don't remember anything.
- You can't multiply zeros.
- Really?
You can only add them.
Is that clear?
Not really.
To the blackboard.
- Write a number.
- Whichever I want?
Whichever you want.
What are you doing, you idiot?
- I'm writing my number.
- That's not a number.
- There are only zeros.
- That's when I'm out of the fire
- into the frying pan.
- Shut up, will you?
The expression is, "Out of the frying pan, into the fire." You didn't know that, did you?
If there are only zeros, it's not a number, but a succession of zeros, which means zero.
- It's one of the first lessons.
- Maybe, but since then...
Since then?
You didn't go further, idiot.
You would have known otherwise.
Arithmetic is an exact science.
I agree with you.
I don't question exactitude,
I'm actually fond of it.
But how do you get to 1,000?
Put a 1 at the front.
- Ever seen a banknote?
- Of course.
Well...
A few ones.
Write 1.
Write it.
Add a zero, you have 10.
Add 2 zeros, it's 100.
With 3 zeros, it's 1,000.
Now, count your zeros.
Six zeros.
One million.
Add 3 more.
Nine zeros make 1 billion.
Three more.
And 3 more...
That's 1 million billion.
And so on.
Your zeros count, see?
I'm afraid you got me wrong.
Ten, 100, 1,000, 1 million...
So far, I manage.
- Even up to 1 billion.
- Wrong.
You can't go that far.
To count 1 million in 20 cents coins, you'd need to count 1 coin/sec 24 hours a day, for 2,000 years.
And for 1 million billion, you'd need 1 million times more.
That's 1 million coin/sec for 2,000 years.
No lunch break, no nap...
Not even a night with your lover.
Come on.
What are you talking about?
Not in front of the kids.
They're here to learn and that's no secret for anyone.
See?
Millions, billions and so on...
That's where things get complicated.
I came to talk to you about a number with 30 zeros.
Thirty zeros?
What planet were you on
What?
There's no such number on the earth.
It only exists in space.
Whoever has 1,000 f says I have 10,000 f.
Whoever has 100,000 says I have 100,000 f.
Whoever has 1 million says I have 1 million.
Whoever has billions...
What does he say?
He doesn't say.
He bursts.
Burst?
What else could he do?
Everything costs 3 cents here.
A fieldfare costs only 2 francs more that a thrush, though they taste differently.
What would you want to do with billions?
There's nothing to do but burst.
What if I don't want to burst?
In that case, I don't know.
Go to banks.
Banks are safety valves.
Like pressure cookers.
They whistle when they need to.
There's a bank over there
- and one down the road.
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.
- Watch the door.
FARMERS' BANK OF THE ALPS
It might be 2 m wide maximum.
It's not much.
Good God!
You're impressive!
What's going on?
Tell me if I'm wrong.
You seem gigantic.
Forget about my size.
Only my skills matter.
Can I help you?
- Maybe.
- Follow me, then.
What can I do for you?
Well, given the circumstances...
What circumstances?
Please come in.
Well, the size matters.
Sorry.
- How could I help you?
- First, let me free my arm.
I'm sorry.
Once the money is deposited, everything'll be like clockwork.
Excuse me.
Some are reluctant but it's worth it.
You might be easily overwhelmed, though.
You'd need many 1,000 f notes to fill my bank up.
Indeed, I have 5,000 f notes to fill it up and it's rather small to me.
I don't want you to lack oxygen.
Are you kidding me?
I have enough space to breathe,
- and to kick you out.
- Don't bother.
Jules?
He took the key with him!
Jules?
What is this?
What's in there?
Bloody hell!
Hey!
What are you up?
- You're ruining my work.
- What's inside?
It's not for you.
It's a secret.
- Jules has no secret for me.
- Yeah right.
Why not?
Step aside and let me finish my work.
How odd that some people aren't curious at all.
They would do anything for money.
- Are you talking about me?
- Of course not!
Fine.
First, Jules hasn't paid me yet and second, I know what's inside.
Nothing.
It's a water tank.
And I'm about to set the fall pipes for the rain.
So the tank will be filled with rainwater.
BANK OF MARSEILLES
Excuse me, officers.
Could you tell me if it's a large bank?
Is there enough space inside to take your hands out?
Yes, if you have enough time.
- Usually, you don't.
- People should take the time...
I'm not in a rush.
Is there anyone?
Me, sir.
- Are you the clerk?
- Yes sir.
- How can I help you?
- I'd like to takes measurements.
- You don't mind?
- I don't.
- What for?
- To know how large your bank is.
Of course.
That's 2 m... and 10 cm.
Excuse me...
could you measure yourself?
- The width of your shoulders?
- My... 43 cm.
You don't take much space.
You must feel at ease.
Sure.
I'm fine.
I guess you have money to deposit.
It's already well deposited.
It surely is.
Fine.
What kind of stocks did you buy?
Industrial?
Industrial stocks?
What is that?
- What about them?
- They're falling.
- It's always the same.
- It's time to buy.
- Buy what?
- You're choilt for spoice.
I mean spoilt for choice, depending on the quotes.
All the quotes are here.
Ten pages full of quotes.
Nothing but quotes.
They're all good to buy.
If I had money, I would buy them all.
Take electricity for instance.
It's fantastic.
It's the future.
Everything will be electric, eclectric, etrectic...
Trains, trams, tranny...
Even toil, soil, I mean oil.
Oil!
Really!
And metallurgy.
What would I do with it?
- Nothing.
- I bought some.
Well, don't.
- What are you doing with it?
- I ask if they fall.
And they say they fall.
- Are you happy with it?
- No.
I'd like to buy things that please me.
Sure.
How much do you have?
Millions?
Worse than that.
Don't tell me you have billions.
Well, something of the sort, but much bigger.
No way.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Billions, that's beyond human understanding!
Don't you want a bicycle?
Yes.
I'd love one.
With 1 billion, you can buy 10,000 bicycles.
Not per year or day, but per second.
Did you hear me?
- Ten thousand biclycles...
- What did you say?
Ten thousand cyclibi...
Again?
You know what I mean.
Ten thousand more.
And again, every second...
For 5,000 years.
And that's not it.
You'll see.
Let's assume that...
What did they do?
Bastards.
A fall pipe.
Crap!
Twenty bicycles less...
It's no big deal.
Father!
I'm glad I met you.
I thought about visiting you.
I'd be delighted, Jules.
I attended your mass once and I heard you say that if we had worries, you were the Big Boss.
That's not what I exactly said.
I said that I knew where the Big Boss was.
Are you worried, Jules?
More than worried.
It might sound stupid...
but I must confess, I'm scared.
Sometimes, it's legitimate.
Actually, I'm not exactly the one who's scared.
- A friend of mine is.
- It's even kinder of you.
This friend has a lot of money.
He's not from here.
- He comes from Auvergne.
- What is he scared of?
He's scared of his money.
It's marvelous to hear that still today, a man's soul can be pure enough to be scared of money.
It proves God exists.
if proof was needed.
I don't know what it proves, but let me explain.
When I say that my friend has a lot of money,
I really mean a lot.
An astronomical amount.
When he knew he had so much, he wondered what to do with it.
He was told to go to the bank, where money should go, like a security valve.
But it didn't work at all.
On the contrary, the banker told him what were billions.
And he got scared.
Do you know, Father, what billions are?
Billions?
Are you sure about that?
- As sure as I am standing here.
- Don't take God as witness.
It's forbidden.
Billions, but that's huge.
Huge and impossible to say.
That's why he's scared.
Who has 1,000 f buys a bicycle and keeps it for life.
Who has 1 million buys 1 bicycle every year for 20 years if he sleeps at night.
It's already very impressive.
But whoever can buy 10,000 bicycles every second during 10,000 years is scared, trust me.
It's not exactly what I had imagined.
It doesn't matter, though.
This fear comes from a good place.
You know what?
Your pal should see himself as a guardian of earthly goods.
God will take everything back.
I'm afraid it won't soothe him.
You speak of the beyond.
I don't want to go that far.
I don't want to...
I mean my friend doesn't want to die.
It's not that serious.
He's scared.
He can't buy 10,000 bicycles every second.
He has only one set of buttocks.
Sorry, father.
Don't be.
I too have only one set of buttocks.
- But you don't have billions.
- Nor a bicycle.
I tried to understand.
I know what to do with 1 mule.
I'm not scared.
But with 100 million mules, you lose your bearings and you get scared.
You start to worry when you no longer know what to do with what you have.
It's time to call the Big Boss.
The Big Boss is always here for sincere calls.
Instead of 10,000 bicycles, your friend should buy 10,000 orphans.
Every second.
He can buy new bicycles every second, and during 5,000 years.
Where should I go then?
I mean where can my friend find so many orphans?
He can't go from door to door.
There'll never be enough.
That's a problem.
Are you familiar with generosity?
No.
I'm not surprised.
Neither am I.
Except mine, which I understand.
But it's not a proper example.
I'm afraid there's no solution to this situation.
Are you sure?
It'd be terrible.
I'm afraid so.
The Big Boss might even be behind it.
How could it be?
I'm not sure, though.
He usually prefers the poor.
But he's full of surprises, that's for sure.
Take a closer look at your friend and you'll see that he's poor.
Are you coming?
I'm thinking.
- What brings you here?
- I need your advice.
- You ridiculed me.
- It was only the 2 of us.
Ridicule starts with a third person.
I don't care.
- What did you do with your hair?
- I put water.
- To smell like a wet dog.
- To look clean.
- We need to talk seriously.
- Well...
- Let's talk seriously.
- Do you know what a billion is?
- I know.
- Really?
I told you I knew.
I don't know what to say.
- Aren't you scared of it?
- No, not even of 100 billion.
- What would you do with them?
- Share them with my husband.
- What would your husband do?
- Well...
- Anything he wants.
- What if he has no idea?
Then we would just love each other.
- Nothing else matters.
- It's not about me.
- I came for a friend of mine.
- Why would I help your friend?
Because my friend has a lot of money, many billions.
Why should I care?
My dad used to call my mom his Finance Minister.
She used to keep the books.
She was good at it.
Not like my friend.
He copes with little money, but with million...
Imagine that he could buy 10,000 bicycles every second.
- What would he do with them?
- You got the point.
- I'm smarter than you think.
- I came especially 'cause I knew you would be like my mom.
I asked many people around.
I heard funny things about generosity and bicycles, but I knew you'd be like a Finance Minister.
That's not what you used to say.
Don't get me wrong.
Never mix finances with feelings.
They don't belong together.
I'm worried about my friend.
Do you know what he's up to with his billions?
He's scared.
What about me?
Don't you wonder if I'm scared?
I know you're not!
What is it?
It smells good.
Is it a casserole?
- Made with despair.
- Really?
- My mom made them with beef.
- So do I, silly you.
And with the boar I bought in town.
But deep down in my casserole, there is despair.
When I'm unhappy, I cook.
And when I'm scared,
I eat.
Your invitation was a pleasant surprise.
It's my friend's treat.
I'm sure he'd be glad...
- It's generosity.
- I'm not sure, Father.
Sit next to me.
I'll feel better.
- So you came, Joseph?
- I never miss a meal.
Bring me the plate.
It's good to see you, Miss Delphine.
Bring me the knives.
Where are the olives?
Thank you.
Serve me some olives.
Put the big lumps in the dish.
- Where's the bread?
- There.
The big lumps in the dish.
It must be terribly expensive.
Today, leave the arithmetic behind.
Arithmetic is prohibited at the table.
Save it for later.
Never save arithmetic for later, or you'll pay for it.
Except when it is for a good cause.
It won't take you anywhere.
Who cares?
We don't want to go anywhere.
We just enjoy where we are.
You won't enjoy it long, if you keep spending money.
There's a Big Boss for everyone, even for the little birds.
I kill 15 little birds every day, Father.
And believe me, they have no fat to spare.
They aren't well cared for, if anyone does.
I weigh them on my scales and none of them exceeds 75 g.
We'll all be weighed on celestial scale.
Hopefully, our bad deeds won't exceed 75g.
What does he have in mind?
Nothing.
I'm hungry.
I eat.
I don't care about the rest.
Give me some cheese.
Pour me some wine.
What are you doing, Henri?
He wants to enjoy the food too.
They're all full of themselves in this family.
He has something at the back of his mind.
In 1913, the county councilor invited all the villagers to a dinner at the post office.
But then he vanished.
I don't like underhand methods.
You would see things underhand even if you were armless.
You have never offered us anything before.
It's suspicious.
He used to eat raw onions.
Now, he orders stews.
Who cook them?
The inn downtown.
Such a meal must be expensive.
- 1,000 f per head.
- More than that.
- The cake is worth a fortune.
- Oh My!
I knew it.
The stew tastes bitter.
- What's inside?
- 1,000 f banknotes.
What?
Oil!
It's pretty spicy.
How dare you, now that you've all eaten?
Do you know what was bitter?
The wild boar bought in town.
With a little, a tiny bit of despair.
You can say what you want.
I don't believe you.
How could you buy the boar?
- They didn't want to sell it.
- They wouldn't give it away but they would sell it.
Money can buy everything.
Come on.
Remember what you told me last time.
- Where did you get this money?
- It's none of your business.
I don't want to owe the innkeeper for the meal.
- Neither do I.
- I was invited.
You won't owe him anything.
I paid him already.
- With what?
- This.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Don't forget it's got my name on it.
Saint Thomas is always punished.
- I don't like that.
- You're jealous.
I'm an honest man.
It couldn't be stolen money.
Stop your innuendos!
Should I remind you of your uncle who stole cod at the grocery.
I'll sue you for slander.
- It's not slander.
It's history.
- Forget Albert's uncle.
I didn't ask you anything.
I only drank milk, which I brought up here.
I'm even with anyone.
Why are you so mysterious?
Mysterious?
She said mysterious, Father!
Where there's money, there's always mystery.
In "Happiness Thief",
Rodolphe has the money, but he stabs himself to death.
It's all very mysterious.
Who talked about a dagger?
Don't get carried away...
- It's a friend.
- What friend?
You don't know him.
He's not from here.
He lives far, very far away, in Auvergne.
A friend from Auvergne.
He's tall, very tall.
A tall friend from Auvergne.
He is...
He's big.
Not big like fat...
He's not big.
Big or not?
What does he do?
He governs.
He's a governor.
What does he govern?
- A government.
- What kind of government?
- A government of Auvergne.
- There's no such thing.
There's a French government and that's it.
I didn't mean that kind of government.
- It's a governors' government.
- I know what he means.
It's like in "The Mysteries of Paris."
It's a mysterious government full of princes.
Exactly.
That's not a French government, but a government of governors with princes.
One of those secret societies.
Who said that?
In my time, people were rude, but we watched our words
- while having a meal.
- I didn't say anything wrong.
- I said society, good God!
- If God says so!
- That's a great friend.
- Sure.
That's just too bad
- he's Jules' friend.
- Even worse, he could be yours.
- My friends aren't governors.
- He doesn't need to be one.
- Who?
- Me.
- Would you do that?
- Yes.
One for me!
Don't forget me, Jules.
I can't believe it.
One for you.
Incredible!
They must be fake.
No, look.
- Want one, Paul?
- Since you give them away.
I'm off.
- What about you?
- That's the least you owe me.
- Get 2.
- No.
One, like everyone else.
Two would be crass.
I won't forgive you for hiding it from me.
- What did he hide?
- That's none of our business.
Hand me the dish.
- I don't want any trouble.
- He's just giving money.
I'm off.
It's dubious.
- May God pay you back!
- Please tell him not to,
I wouldn't know how to spend it.
- For you, Miss Delphine.
- For me too?
- He's Croesus!
- He doesn't know...
- ...how to spend it.
- I would know, if a cretin dropped by my house 10,000 f every day.
You could ask for 50,000 f.
I'd go up to 100,000.
I'm sure I'd have lots of ideas to spend them.
We're living a Golden Age.
I thought you priests were into spiritual matters.
I was wrong.
Do you believe that a golden age is about getting money?
Look what's going on.
We are stripped bare by the curse of plenty.
Look closer and you'll find demons in there.
I know demons well.
I live around one.
His name is misery.
What do you really know about misery?
Misery is lust.
Come to us if you want to know more about misery.
Shut up, Albert.
You know nothing about it.
And neither do I. When we're cold, we burn wood.
When we're hot, we go out.
When we're hungry, we eat.
When we're thirsty, we drink.
When we're tired, we sleep.
- You call that misery?
- Yes, I do!
That's not fair.
He had us come here because it pleases him.
If we had money, we would have been pleased not to come.
That's misery.
See?
There are all kinds of misery.
I respect you and don't want to be rude
But he has to know what I think of him.
Look at him...
Misery is not what is eating away at him.
He has money like dogs have fleas.
What does he do with his money?
Let me tell you.
He hides it in his closet, under piles of sheets.
What will happen if he has more cash than sheets?
- That's misery!
- Either you're drunk or it's me, but I didn't understand a word.
- Are you threatening me?
- Exactly.
- How are you threatening us?
- With being rich.
You complain about misery, you'll complain about wealth.
- Did he come again?
- Yes.
- Did he give some more?
- Yes.
A lot?
- And the others?
- Don't know.
- Rose?
Albert?
- I saw no one.
He gave everyone money again.
- Morning, Albert.
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Emile,
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Marie.
- Morning, Paul.
Morning, Old Man Burle.
What?
Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Rose.
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Old Man Martin.
- Morning, Paul
Won't you store your potatoes?
No.
- You don't intend to?
- No.
- What are you waiting for?
- The same as you.
You haven't stored your rye, have you?
He came back, didn't he?
What does he want?
- Nothing.
- He didn't say.
He probably wants something in return.
- Maybe he wants power.
- Do you think so?
Or something else.
He wouldn't need to pay to have you.
Or something else.
What?
No one can tell.
He must want a lot!
But we don't have anything.
We must have something that he wants.
Gishlaine, bring Grandpa home.
- She doesn't trust us.
- Everyone has secrets.
- They're all suspicious.
- They have reasons to.
- What did I do to you?
- Nothing.
- You speak too much.
- What?
- Stay at home.
- I can come out if I want.
- What for?
- Who cares?
- I do.
- Who will stop me?
- Me.
- How?
- Does it hurt?
- No.
- Is your tooth still loose?
- It was already the case.
- What's wrong?
- I'm listening.
It's the wind.
- And that?
- Must be a rat.
- Are the banknotes safe?
- From what?
- The rats.
- No.
- Where are they?
- The closet.
We should put them in a tin box.
Don't you have any cake tin?
In the closet.
- It's humid.
- Let's put them in a container.
- What?
- Something solid.
- An iron casserole!
- Let me see it.
- Does it hurt?
- He kicked me in the back.
Why the hell did you fight?
Listen.
- It's the wind.
- No, it's not.
Burle has his light on.
Don't let Grandpa out.
Paul?
Paul?
Your cash is here.
If you don't want it, I'll give it to the others.
Albert!
What?
It has to stop.
We're not puppets.
Emile!
- What?
- It has to stop.
We're going.
I'm coming.
- Mr. Jules?
- Yes.
That's right.
We are 2.
We love to play this trick.
I thought my head was spinning.
Normally, heads spin after we have left.
Sometimes, heads fall.
- Do they?
- In serious cases.
How can you tell a case is serious?
It's our decision.
- The weather's nice today.
- We wished it were warmer.
- You don't live in the open?
- We do.
- Any friends in the region?
- No.
- It ain't easy to chat with you.
- It is...
- I'll help you out.
- Don't bother.
It's no big deal.
We came here on purpose.
- For me?
- For you.
- From far?
- Pretty much.
- Did you walk?
- No.
- How can I help you?
- I have a question.
Where does the money you gave to the innkeeper come from?
- The innkeeper?
- Yes.
A week ago, you had a feast.
The innkeeper delivered it.
You paid him with new banknotes.
Every banknote has to be new before it's old.
We don't have any problem with that.
We just want to know where you took them.
I said "took".
- It's a friend of mine.
- We don't believe it, do we?
- Even from Auvergne?
- From Auvergne or anywhere else, friends are against our religion.
I thought so.
Let's not beat around the bush.
You're an intelligence agent, and you'd better stay one.
Where did you take the money?
It's the third time I ask.
Next, you'll deal with my brother.
It's too bad.
He's a stutterer.
He uses his hands.
I found the cash in a bomb in the mountain.
- An aluminum container.
- How could I know?
My paper says it's an aluminum container.
Around here, we don't care about such details.
But I have to.
We've been on this case for 2 years.
"An aluminum container dropped by a plane."
We're lucky it's deserted around here.
Didn't you wonder at all about that money?
Did you think it was the Holy Spirit?
I didn't think anything.
I found it and I took it.
Why should I wonder at it?
I'm a shepherd.
- Know what this money was?
- No.
It's the arrow of Parthe.
Also called the Jarnac Stroke around here or as you would say, "some deep shit".
Do you remember the Normandy landings 2 years ago?
The army of occupation left, but they weren't happy.
They wanted the rot to set in.
So, they made billion of forged banknotes.
But as good as true.
To ruin the national economy...
- It doesn't ring any bell.
- Right.
What about the money?
In my house, in potato sacks.
- Did you spend much?
- I gave some in the village.
- Get in the car.
- And my sheep?
Later.
Hurry up!
I don't want to spend the night here.
- You didn't spend anything?
- No.
- That was a lot of cash, though.
- We didn't know how to.
It befell us like misery befalls the poor.
- I got scared.
- It's harmless, though.
We wondered what he wanted.
What could I want?
Look around you.
Is there anything you want?
If you want it, you can have it.
And for free.
I'd have never believed that people could be so complicated.
Well, buddy,
Money is best used for buying.
If you have other plans,
- it's at your own risk.
- But I was buying.
Not what they had, but what they didn't.
I was buying misery.
Misery is on sale.
You should have spent it for the common good.
The common good?
Like what?
We could have built a bridge?
- Over what?
- Nothing.
Just a bridge.
- What would we use it for?
- Nothing.
It'd be just a bridge.
- And where would you want it?
- There.
Where there's nothing.
Sir?
- For you.
- Thank you, my dear.
Thanks.
Eat the last one.
It's good.
60 km/h.
One minute.
Thirty seconds.
She went over 500m, 600, 700...
950... 10...3,2...0.
Shit, she didn't come.
- Who's there?
- It's me.
Why are you here?
I told you that only my husband would pass through this door.
- Come on.
Open.
- Only my husband!
Open the door.
It's... your husband.
- What did you say?
- It's your husband.
Where is he?
Right here, before you.
It's me.
You?
- Do you know what happened?
- I know.
Come in.
- I'll set a place for you.
- Thank you.
THE END
Hello.
Hawthorne here.
Oh New York .. well, put him on.
Hello Charlie, how are you?
Me?
Oh fine .. fine.
No, nothing new.
Oh sure there are disturbances.
A few guys getting killed here and there.
Well, that doesn't add up to a Revolution.
Listen Charlie .. the Generalissimo will never get this far north.
Sure, sure I'm working.
What do you want me to do?
Invent a war for you?
I know.
I know you need copy.
Color stories, huh?
Human interest, yeah.
Sure .. sure, I'll dig up something.
Okay, Charlie.
Where the devil am I going to find a human interest story?
"But the fact is a story was beginning.
Though I didn't know it then."
"At twelve o'clock, the Bishop summoned a young Priest named Arturo Carrera."
Good day Monsignor.
─ Good day, Father.
Good day Arturo.
I do not see how we can keep our eyes closed to the situation any longer.
There comes a time, when we must take a stand.
Read this .. read it out loud.
I want to hear how it sounds.
Entry to this house of God, is forbidden to immodestly dressed women ..
Whose frocks do not cover their elbows and their knees.
Yes.
Very good, very good.
Now I want to translate it into German, into English, and into Italian ..
And post it on the door today.
Is this all we have to be concerned within the Church today?
What is the matter?
─ Women's elbows and knees?
Did you know that one tried to come in last week.
In what I believe are called .. "shorts".
Better in shorts I would have thought, than not at all.
Monsignor.
Have you forgotten that fewer than 15% of the workers attend mass here anymore?
And that where we once had "love" and "trust" we know have downright hatred.
Does no-one in the Church ever ask themselves the reason for this?
Well, there are certain proprieties that ..
─ Monsignor.
The Church in Spain is falling to pieces.
All Spain seems to be falling to pieces.
Tomorrow it may be the world.
I don't mean to be impertinent.
At a time like this when one Church after another is being burned or destroyed.
And another priest murdered every day.
Have we really nothing better to worry about but a few knees and elbows?
The Church of God my son, is like a net let down into the sea.
Then why doesn't it catch more fish?
Whatever your intentions Father, you are being impertinent.
Very impertinent.
Let us all pray to God to give those people back their faith.
They haven't lost faith in God.
They've lost it in us, the Church.
We failed them.
They look to us for protection against injustice and this is answer we give them.
A preposterous reminder there are parts of a woman's body that Bishops disapprove.
Why shouldn't they look to other people for help and hope?
I wonder if you know the seriousness of what you are saying, Father?
I think I do, Monsignor ..
I've thought about this for a long time.
Then there is no excuse for you to confuse the eternity of the Church.
With the weaknesses and failures of its members.
Or to forget that for every failure.
There is a martyred Priest whose blood is the very seed of the Church.
How do I know they were martyrs?
─ Arturo, please!
Why weren't they simply just fools?
─ I've been patient with you, Father.
How do I know they didn't die for a myth?
Or for a ghost?
A ghost of a dead church.
A cause isn't necessarily true because a man dies for it.
His dying merely proved that he believed in it.
Not that he wasn't a fool to do so.
Arturo, my son.
Will you kneel with me and ask God for forgiveness?
I cannot ..
I cannot bring myself to believe.
That this Church is serving either God or man today.
I cannot believe that God himself is impressed by the platitudes and piety.
Than the people here are.
I can't.
In the Seminary ..
I was taught.
Love and deeds.
I was taught that the poor and the dirty were as important in His eyes ..
As the owners of Hispano-Suizas and great yachts.
The truth is that nothing .. nothing!
Nothing I was taught in the Seminary has been of any value to me here whatsoever.
And more and more I find myself sharing the workers' feelings.
This is not the Church of our fathers.
This is a different Church.
A Church I don't understand or respect.
And what is worse ..
A Church in which I can find no way of serving Him, as I was taught to serve Him.
Don't go any further, Arturo.
It may not be so easy to un-say the things you are saying.
Or to undo such a rash and wicked act.
May God forgive me if I am wrong.
But I can accept this Church no longer.
I must find another way.
Arturo.
Get off the line Operator or Censor, or whoever.
I'm talking to New York.
Of Continental Broadcasting Company.
Hello New York?
Charlie?
I haven't talked to Madrid this morning, but I can tell you it is just a rumor.
Certainly, that is an air-raid siren.
So what?
Every time three seagulls fly over this place, some drunk pushes the button.
I want to make a little correction here.
That joker wasn't drunk this time, and ..
Those aren't seagulls dropping this stuff.
This is the "kick-off" Charlie-boy!
The war is on!
Oh, dear mother of God.
I don't want to die.
Will you let her sit down please?
Let her sit down for a moment.
This is the new Crusade.
To put to rout the enemies of the Church.
If the Crusaders don't blow us up first.
Of course.
They won't hit the churches.
I hope not.
But during the Rif War they invariably killed everybody they set out to rescue.
Have you jacket and trousers?
Of sorts, Monsignor.
People will be angry after this and attack us again.
But this time .. they will destroy our Cathedral.
Don't say that, Monsignor.
But one thing they must not destroy.
They must not destroy our Holy Relic.
The blessed Blood of St John.
So after this is over.
Change into your jacket and trousers for no priest will be safe in the streets.
Then you will take our Holy Relic out of here.
And deliver it to our friends, who are fighting for Our Lord.
And against this wicked government.
I don't want to be alone.
─ Is it very bad out there?
Horrible.
─ Perhaps I can do something to help.
Don't go away please, there is a doctor and some soldiers near.
Please don't leave me alone.
─ Alright, I won't.
I'll be alright in a minute.
Thank you.
You alright now?
No, I'm not alright, but I am better.
Were you as scared as I was?
More scared I'd say.
Oh no, that is impossible.
Nobody can be that scared.
I wonder .. if there might be another way out of here.
You might try through there.
Oh yes, let's try.
Aren't you coming, too?
Oh .. yes, in a moment or two.
I should mind my own business, huh?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
It's just that ..
I'm the only person who can help myself, at the moment.
I know .. sometimes, I feel like that.
Perhaps .. perhaps you need someone to talk to.
I wish I had.
You're not married?
─ No.
Well, that is a part of it.
You are lonely.
─ Yes, perhaps.
Adiós.
─ Arturo.
Arturo .. mine is Soledad.
─ Adiós, Soledad.
[ tannoy ] "Attention comrades.
Bulletin number five."

"One hundred and fifty-five deaths have already been reported."
"Including fifty-eight women and seventeen children."
Comrades .. comrades .. comrades!
The Priests did it!
The priests are on the wrong side.
On to the Cathedral!
We must get with the soldiers who've come to protect us.
To their leaders.
Do you think you can do this, Father?
─ I will Monsignor.
I promise you.
I'm sure you will.
[ tannoy ] "Attention comrades to bulletin number ten."

[ police whistle ]
Your order, Señor?
Beer.
Afraid somebody will see you here?
No.
Wouldn't you like to go someplace where it is more private?
In one of the boxes?
They are not expensive.
Alright.
Now, if you excuse me Passion-flower, I must get back to my unpleasant work.
But is that good for an eyeball?
Water?
It's not water, honey.
It is English gin.
Very antiseptic.
I have to make a broadcast at 3 o'clock.
That's 9 o'clock New York time.
But do you need four eyeballs?
Every one-eyed gentleman needs at least four for routine social demands.
This one has a rather wicked glint in it, for leering at you girls after midnight.
This one?
Has a good, clean honest look.
For dealing with mothers.
This one?
This one is simply bloodshot.
─ What is that?
This one is for patriotic occasions.
That's an American flag on the pupils.
A tribute to God's country impossible for the old-fashioned, two-eyed man.
Well, Adiós dear Soledad.
─ Adiós, Uncle.
What's the name of that girl down there?
Would you like to buy me a little drink?
─ Not tonight Señorita.
A call for you in number three.
Who is he?
─ I don't know.
I never saw him before.
Already?
[ tannoy ] "Attention comrades."
"The priest Carrera has been recognized in the last hour in the Plaza del Sol"
"He has discarded his jacket, and now wears black trouser and a white shirt."
Did you follow me here?
─ No.
Then, what are you doing here?
You told me I was lonely.
Yes I know, but I didn't want to meet in a place like this.
I was only joking.
I just came in here to get away from all the trouble out there.
Yes, I know.
Isn't it terrible?
All this shooting, bombing and burning everything.
What's it all about?
Do you know?
─ It's a revolt against the government.
Whatever it is, I wish they'd leave the churches alone.
I don't care what they do to the priests, but it is bad luck to burn churches.
Just look at that.
Usually we have twice as many people on a Thursday night.
Look, why don't you go to the café and wait for me there?
It won't take me a minute to change.
Would you mind if we just stayed here, and talked for a while first?
Just talk?
That's all, yes.
You see, that's the trouble.
That's why I'm sorry you came here, because ..
If you like somebody and they find you in a place like this.
Well, they might get the wrong idea.
You know, people don't always understand about people.
No.
I know.
Working here doesn't make me any different.
It's just a job to me.
Do you know that I don't know half the names of these fellows.
You see what I mean?
─ Yes, yes.
I see.
I need a drink.
Whose drink is this?
─ I bought it for that other girl.
Oh .. thank you darling.
Health, pesetas, and love for two.
Now what?
Everybody remain where you are.
And be ready with your identification papers.
Just the men.
What's this all about?
They're looking for a priest.
─ A priest in here?
How do you like that?
A priest in a cabaret.
I hope they don't beat him up in here.
That will really ruin the whole night.
Will they come up here?
─ Well, I suppose so.
Why?
Aren't your papers alright?
I haven't got any papers.
They're at home.
In your cassock.
Get downstairs.
I don't want you here when they come.
No wonder you were so worried.
Get downstairs.
It will only mean trouble for us both.
Wait, I know a way.
Come on.
You don't want to be beaten up, do you?
─ Or to get you into trouble either.
Go in there.
Come on.
You are very brave, but you are also very foolish.
So are you .. come on.
Alright.
Come on, let's see your papers.
Come on, come on.
We're alright now.
It is just across the street.
Come on, come on.
Alright, come on, let's see your papers.
This way Señorita.
Not tonight Caballero.
I've already got a fellow.
I know that fellow, and it's not a priest he is usually after.
Wait here.
[ gunshots ]
Two to one, they shot the wrong fellow.
Well, it is not The Ritz of course but ..
Guess who?
Which one?
This is me, and that is my little sister.
She's married now.
I'm going back there some day when I've saved enough money.
Where's that?
It's a little village in the mountains.
You wouldn't know it.
I'm supposed to be a dressmaker.
You know you are risking your life doing this, don't you?
Oh, I doubt that.
I'll move in with the girl upstairs and tomorrow we'll get you out of here.
Anyone who helps the priests is equally guilty.
The announcements said that.
Those shaggers don't frighten me, Father.
I thought you didn't like priests.
I didn't know you were a priest.
I'm not any more.
Will you say that again.
─ I said I'm not a priest any longer.
I left the church this morning.
Left it?
How?
I just walked out.
That's all.
But you can't do that .. can you?
You not only can, but you must if you faith has failed you.
Well, I've never heard of anything like that before in my life.
Have you got a back way out of here?
Back way?
For what?
─ I cannot stay here.
Why not?
You're not a priest any more.
You said so yourself.
It's too dangerous.
It's not dangerous now.
They've already checked.
It's not the end.
They'll be checking the houses next.
But I won't let them in.
The door is locked.
There's a mob out there.
They'll break down the door.
Alright.
Let's push this against ..
─ It's no use ..
They know I'm in this quarter.
It's only hours before they check every room.
Don't you like me?
Yes.
Very much.
Is it because I'm a cabaret girl?
─ Please try and understand me.
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened for us both!
Why do you think I brought you here?
Because you're very kind and brave.
You pity me even though you dislike priests.
Did I know you were a priest when you came in the Bar Michel?
Did I?
Did I know you were a priest tonight when you came in the cabaret?
I brought you here because of some people said.
I don't know what.
Something said this is a very special person.
That you should take care of him and not let him get hurt.
Because some day he'll be very important.
And I tell you this before God himself.
I'll come back.
No you won't.
─ I promise you.
I promise you I will.
No you won't.
No.
Because ..
Because you know there is no danger now.
But I'm not good enough for you.
I'm a whore.
Please, please believe me.
─ Get out!
─ Please.
Get out!
If you'll tell me how.
Which is the back way?
Find it yourself.
I'm very sorry Soledad.
Once a priest, always a priest.
Open up in there!
This is the Militia!
Open up!
Stay here and keep quiet.
─ But what will they do?
It doesn't matter what they do.
Stay here and keep quiet.
You understand me?
Open up in there!
I'm sorry.
Open up.
Come in.
I'm Carrera.
The man you want.
Alright .. come on.
[ tannoy ] "Today our loyal Army fights two forces."
"The rebel troops approaching the city from the south."
"And the secret enemy within the city."
"Five priests and other rebel sympathizers"
"Who are working to spread fear and defeat among us."
"Both forces will be destroyed!"
[ Hawthorne ] "But there was another force that no army could fight."
"The unhappy hearts of a people wondering where the relic of St John had vanished."
"It led me, for reasons of my own."
"To visit the local prison."
Arturo Carrera?
Yes.
─ My name is Hawthorne.
Continental Broadcasting Company.
─ Yes.
I understand you withdrew from the church yesterday.
I'm sorry.
It is not a subject I want to discuss for publication.
It is not for publication.
I represent another interest at the moment.
Did you desert your church because you lost your faith in God?
No.
Of course not.
─ You can speak quite freely with me.
I'm an infidel.
What interest?
Would you be willing to serve him outside the church?
Naturally, that would be my hope, but ..
Would you be willing to discuss your position with a member of the government?
If you can't tell me who you represent, there is nothing to say to each other.
I'm sorry.
You leave something to be desired when an effort is being made to rescue you.
[ Hawthorne ] "By now, I knew that Carrera was my big story."
"And the path to him led through the Commandant."
Alright then, let's approach it from another angle.
You are wasting your time with anything you have to say on behalf of a priest.
What is being offered here, Captain.
Is an opportunity to serve your government on a global scale.
Strike the chains from this convertible priest.
Give him a small office.
A modest title.
And you will have reshaped the thinking of the world single-handed.
Never again will they be able to say that you shoot priests like rabbits.
You misunderstand, Mr Hawthorne.
It is traitors and not priests, that we shoot like rabbits.
When there is no war and the priests are confined to their churchly duties.
They would be of no more interest to me ..
Than so many fortune-tellers and witch-doctors.
But as long as they plot and plan against their legal government.
They are spies working for the enemies of that government.
And will be dealt with as such.
Does that make my position clear?
─ You sound prejudiced to me.
Indeed I am.
Prejudiced against an institution that has ridden on the backs of our people.
Since the time of The Inquisition.
You're the Intelligence Officer here?
─ Yes, comrade General.
I'm General Clavé, the new Commander.
What's this blood business on the walls?
What blood business?
─ Chalked over the walls, everywhere.
"Where is St somebody's blood?"
Has the enemy got St somebody's blood?
I saw it a dozen times on the way from the airport.
With your permission, Captain.
It's a local religious legend, General.
The Holy Relic in the Cathedral here, was a drop of blood shed by St John.
It has been working miracles here since time immemorial.
One of the beliefs is ..
Whoever holds it cannot be defeated.
─ What nonsense.
Napoleon's words exactly outside this very city in 1812.
Just before being driven back over the horizon.
That's right, by George.
I remember now.
The only defeat he suffered in Spain.
Where is it?
─ That's the big question now.
It seems to have disappeared during the patriotic bonfire last night.
And the news in beginning to disturb some of the apprentice atheists.
May I ask who you are?
─ Mr Hawthorne is a radio broadcaster.
I'm sorry, I don't talk to journalists.
Will you excuse us please.
Certainly comrade General.
Is that true what he said?
─ I'm sure it is.
A relic like that can exert a powerful influence in a place like this.
It is what priests have done to Spain.
─ Dammit, I've never seen such war.
People all the same color, same language.
I can't tell one crowd from the other.
Now, somebody's blood.
What was his name?
─ St John.
Local fellow?
Some centuries ago, I believe.
─ Absolutely ridiculous.
Get out and shut that door.
This is confidential.
We've got to pull out of here.
─ Already?
There is no way to defend this place.
It is a bloody trap.
These troops we've got here.
The militia men, they are not really soldiers.
Just civilians with rifles, and half of them are no more than schoolboys.
They are very brave, comrade General.
─ Brave but inaccurate.
But I am going to need your help Captain.
I'm a little rusty at this business.
I retired from the Army ten years ago and haven't read a newspaper since.
They have a lot of new ideas these days.
─ Have you?
I thought so.
They never left well enough alone, do they?
No, not if they think they can do better.
─ That's it exactly.
The mistake they all make.
Trying to improve things.
In the old days .. war made sense.
One country fought another country, attired in different uniforms.
Our crowd spoke Spanish while the others jabbered away in something else.
A very simple situation.
If you couldn't understand what the other fellow was saying, you shot him.
But the way it is today ..
I think that we should get this relic comrade General.
What relic?
─ The Holy Relic of St John.
You really think it will work?
─ In a way.
It's a matter of morale.
─ Morale?
That's another piece of nonsense they've cooked up since I left.
In the old days, you simply told your men to get out there and fight.
And they got out there and fought.
Not "why" just "whom".
You really knew where you stood in those days, by George.
Excuse me comrade General, but about this relic?
Do you know what I think we ought to do about that relic, Captain?
What?
─ Get it.
A relic like that can exert a powerful influence in a place like this.
It's what the priests have done to Spain.
─ I'll go after it at once, General.
Don't just go after it.
Get it.
─ Yes, comrade General.
It's a matter of morale.
─ Of course.
Here.
Go in.
Shut the door.
You seem to have lost your faith at a very convenient moment, Father.
I don't expect you to believe me, but the process has been going on for some time.
Then you are an atheist now?
─ No.
It was my faith in the church which failed.
Not my faith in God.
It's a curious thing that two priests went missing from the Cathedral.
It is more curious that the Holy Relic in the Church was also missing.
Can you explain that to me?
No ..
I didn't know it was missing.
I suggest to you that one of those priests ..
Either you or Canon Rota ..
Was ordered by your Bishop ..
To take it and deliver it to Franco and his rebels.
I know nothing about it.
I had left the Cathedral before the attack came.
But why are you so interested in it?
I didn't know that atheists placed any importance in .. in religious symbols.
We don't .. but we know that an ignorant mob of renegade Christians do.
And always will.
This relic could become less a symbol than a weapon.
Like a hidden battery of artillery.
When did you last see Canon Rota?
You mean, your men are already disturbed by it?
People are always disturbed about something.
Perhaps they would be less disturbed if their hearts were not ignored.
Yes .. you are still a Christian.
Still preaching.
If I may make a suggestion, Captain.
You know nothing about Christians.
Particularly renegade Christians.
Otherwise, you would know what to do about their disturbance.
You mean, you do?
Yes, I think I do ..
I think I know very well what to do.
And if I can make another suggestion ..
I would like to do it.
You would like to do something for the socialists?
No ..
I'd like to do something for the men, the ones that are troubled.
I'd like to comfort them.
I'd like to be a missionary to the hearts of your ignorant and troubled Army.
What happened?
Did you find him?
─ I told you I would, didn't I.
Is he alright?
─ Oh, sure.
They didn't beat him up again, did they?
He's probably the most un-beat-up priest in the diocese today.
But what is all this?
Don't tell me you are in love with this whirling dervish?
Are you crazy?
How can I be in love with a priest?
I was just worried about him.
Besides, he's not a Priest any more.
With his current spiritual status, you won't have to worry about him for a time.
What do you mean?
─ He's joined the management.
Joined what management?
The government.
The department of worried atheists.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard of.
A priest going over to the heathens?
Would you be good enough to move just a little bit to your left?
How would you like to lose the other one?
The aims of Socialism are exactly the same as the aims of the Church.
They follow different paths, but the destination is the same.
Man's happiness.
I think if you keep this in mind, it may help you.
[ tannoy ] "Although our troops continue their courageous resistance."
"We have been obliged to rectify our lines in certain sectors."
How far would you say, Captain?
Fifty or sixty kilometers.
The opposition tonight says forty.
The Continental Broadcasting Company won't have a correspondent here long ..
If he continues to listen to the enemy wireless.
The Continental is trying to be fair and impartial, Captain.
It hates both sides.
Are there any plans to rectify our lines by getting the hell out of here?
On the contrary.
We're already preparing a counter-attack.
Reinforcements are arriving from Barcelona tonight,
And the city is in no danger whatever.
Soledad.
Wait a minute.
─ What's the matter?
But I didn't know the soldiers were that close.
If I had known I ..
I could've got you out.
I swear I could.
─ I'm sure you could have.
But everything is alright now.
That's why I am here.
To tell you about it.
But .. you are not angry?
No.
Not in the least .. would you like to hear what happened?
Yes, I would .. very much .. come on in.
Would you like to talk some more about it?
─ Yes.
Very much.
Come on.
The situation isn't likely to arise after all.
Any more questions?
About the "Holy Relic", what they call the "blessed blood".
Is it true that if we haven't got it, we will be defeated?
The Holy Relic has a place in many hearts.
But it will never have anything to do with victory or defeat.
Not even the church can tell you that.
I don't understand him anyway.
If you want help, come and see me.
You know where I am.
Thank you.
I need some help too, Arturo.
I'm sorry comrade.
I sleep in what's left of the Cathedral.
If you could come up there, some night ..
late ..
I can't.
It's impossible.
I don't think I can last much longer.
Please go away.
I'm not going to report you, but don't try to see me again.
He's a fool and he always was, coming to me in a public place like that.
Endangering both our lives.
─ What did he want?
Help, he said.
I could have helped him there.
How can I go to the Cathedral?
They are watching me all the time.
You mean now?
─ Perhaps not now at this moment.
But they must keep an eye on me.
I'm a renegade priest.
I suppose he had no-one else to go to.
─ That's what worries me.
Nobody liked him.
But it's not your fault, darling.
There was nothing you could do, really.
─ I should have done something.
It's just that I'm not certain of things yet.
I shall know better, soon.
Is that what you think?
─ What do you mean?
Why, just because you got a late start.
I don't know why you expect to be less mixed up than everybody else.
This is a nice place.
It's so peaceful.
[ gunshots!
]
Well .. at least it used to be, anyway.
They're rounding up deserters again.
Or digging out members of the fifth column.
I quit this morning.
Quit?
─ The cabaret.
You said you understood, but you didn't really.
I wish I knew ..
How to tell you ..
How I feel about you.
Is it good?
Yes, it is very good.
Do you really like me?
That's what I wish I knew how to tell you.
How much.
How much.
That I feel .. awkward and clumsy like a schoolboy.
If I tell you something.
You won't laugh?
─ No.
I promise.
I like that.
Because it makes me feel like a schoolgirl.
You won't laugh, now?
─ No, I'm not laughing.
I'll tell you something else.
You are the first person I've ..
I've ever really known in my life.
The very first.
You promised you wouldn't laugh.
─ Uhuh.
This must be the way.
Young girls feel.
When they've just met a wonderful boy.
And they just .. touch hands.
And can't say anything.
I once saw my little sister like that.
She'd just sit with this boy and ..
Not say a word.
Neither one of them.
And every now and then, they'd giggle.
I cried myself to sleep the first night I saw that.
Don't.
Don't say it unless you really mean it.
I mean it.
And if .. if you are not sure?
If you don't know yet ..
I'll wait.
But if you do say it, and don't mean it ..
I'll want to die.
Because this will never happen to me again .. not like this.
I love you.
Say it again.
I love you.
Like my little sister and that little boy.
The same, but more so.
And you won't be sorry?
You're sure?
That's what I keep on asking myself.
How can I be so certain .. so soon.
But you know, a priest doesn't live in a vacuum.
He may not share in all of life.
But it's not a stranger to him.
His ears and eyes and thoughts.
And you're not the first woman I've ever seen.
Or talked to.
Or thought about.
Just the first I've ever loved.
The first I've ever wanted to spend my whole life with.
Is that a full battalion?
─ All that's left of it, comrade General.
More desertions?
─ Yes, comrade General.
You think it's that Relic?
─ I'm afraid the rebels have it.
Where is that Intelligence Officer?
What is his name?
Comrade Captain Botargus.
Go and get him.
─ Yes, comrade General.
Intelligence officer ..
What a war.
We will move the second battalion out at midnight.
That's the last man I'm going to waste in this bloody trap.
What about the prisoners, comrade General?
The order from Madrid?
How many have we got here?
─ About two hundred.
Very well.
Call them in here at 2 o'clock and we'll send them down the line as roadblock.
It's a dirty trick sticking civilians into the trenches.
But that seems to be the whole art of winning wars these days.
Successful dirty tricks.
Father Rota?
Father?
Father Rota?
Don't be frightened, Father.
I'm a friend of Arturo's.
Father Arturo.
I ..
I brought you some food.
I'll put it here for you.
He wanted to come himself.
He wanted to help you but he's still being watched.
They don't really trust him.
But if there is anything I can do for you.
If you will just tell me?
Alright, I'll leave you alone now.
I'm sorry I frightened you.
Goodnight, Father.
Run Father!
Run!
Thank you Señorita for leading us so promptly to the man we were after.
Has she been searched?
─ Thoroughly, comrade Captain.
You are in a very serious situation here, Señorita.
The charge against that priest is treason.
Now, what were you doing with him?
Exactly what I told your friend.
I took him some food.
Don't lie to me.
─ I'm no lying to you!
He was a hungry old man and I took him something to eat.
I know he's a priest and I shouldn't have done that.
Hungry old priests should starve to death!
That's all there was to it.
What more can I tell you?
What did you say to him?
What did he say to you?
He said nothing to me.
Not even "thank you" for the food.
What did the Reverend Arturo tell you say to him?
Who is the Reverend Arturo?
How would you like to be questioned with instruments?
What more can I tell you if I don't know anything?
You have no idea how many people manage to remember things they never knew.
Until a few of their finger-nails are pulled out.
If I were you, I would think this whole situation over again.
Don't you worry about it.
I'll write the letter for you.
Just tell me what you want me to tell her and where she lives.
San Amantina.
Twenty.
Arturo.
Wait a minute.
Is it true that a Priest never loses his Holy powers, regardless of what he does?
That's what the Church says.
And you for example, can still hear a confession and give absolution?
Yes .. under certain circumstances.
Come with me.
One moment, Captain.
I'm no longer a Priest.
And I've no intention of pretending to be one.
Not even for an old friend and associate who has asked for you?
The Reverend Canon Rota is to be executed in the morning.
Would you deny him his final consolation?
The Canon is a brave man.
There are no limits to my admiration for a brave man.
Even a Priest.
If a man has a fancy for such nonsense.
─ One more thing.
You'll be wasting your time if you think you'll be shown secrets of a confession.
Even by an apostolic priest.
─ My dear Arturo.
You are being much too suspicious.
The hiding of a holy relic is hardly a thing to be confessed.
Now go in, please.
And get it over with.
I'm very sorry, Father.
─ No.
This is very kind of you.
Have you any news of the young woman?
What young woman?
The one you sent with the food.
Is that how they caught you in the Cathedral?
Didn't you know?
Did they arrest the young woman too?
Yes.
Didn't you send her?
Then I'm afraid I've put you in a very cruel position.
I thought you had changed.
No.
I was hoping you might do this last service to the Blessed Relic.
I won't even discuss that with you.
There is nobody else.
I'm no longer a member of the Church and you know that.
Do you want me to confess you or not?
Forgive me, Father.
Of course I do.
You never believed in it anyway, did you?
No.
─ Neither did I.
I was either too stupid or not stupid enough.
I don't know which.
All those miracles.
But now I do.
Walking the streets all this time.
Hiding in crowds, listening to the whispers.
I learned something.
Have you seen what they write on the walls?
Yes.
They are terrified, Arturo.
They've got no God, now.
They've been emancipated from all that.
All they've got now ..
Is this sad little secret faith in a drop of blood.
That has been as much a part of their lives ..
As their fathers and mothers.
It's like a little lamp in their hearts that nobody else knows about.
And as long as they can look inside and see its light and feel its warmth.
They know that the way home is still open.
Now it is flickering and they are frightened.
if it goes out .. they will be like little children lost in the dark.
That's why the rest of them died.
God rest their dear souls.
To keep it burning.
─ The rest of whom died?
Our brothers.
All of them?
Didn't you know, really?
No.
I thought they had been arrested.
That's what I was told.
They were.
All but Peres and Desidro.
Who died in the Church.
And Monsignor?
He wouldn't tell them.
The others ..
I don't know how they stood it.
I don't know how they kept from giving in.
When you are in pain like this.
They pulled out my nails.
Nothing.
In either heaven or earth ..
Seems worth it.
Bless me Father .. for I have sinned.
I've changed my mind.
Where is it?
Was a young woman brought down here?
─ Not down here.
God, we wanted seagulls this time.
That was a pretty long confession.
─ Where is Señorita Soledad?
Waiting for you my friend.
Crying for you in fact.
Why didn't you tell her?
─ I didn't know myself.
Arrest this man.
Wait!
Pull her up.
Arturo ..
─ But she doesn't know!
No.
But you do.
Rota just told you.
But he didn't!
A little higher.
─ Ahh!
The Priests were fools until the end.
But you are not a Priest now.
You are a man.
And that's your woman, there.
A little higher still.
─ Let her down.
Let her down!
As soon as you've told me where that bloody Relic is.
The exact location.
That was a confession.
You know very well what "confession" means.
I know you Godly people have peculiar ideas but ..
Will you kindly tell me what the hell you are doing there?
In two more minutes, I'll have the Relic, comrade General.
Do you mean the thing that was going to save the city?
I mean that relic that you ordered me to get.
Has she got it?
─ No, but ..
Let her down.
Of all the colossal stupidities.
Get her out there with the rest of the prisoners.
Who is this fellow?
─ The priest who knows where the relic is.
Take him out there too.
And all the others in the cells down here.
Is this the way you wage war now?
Hanging beautiful women?
But this is a matter of importance comrade General.
Would you like to have a drink with me in my quarters?
What a war.
Is this really what you've been fiddling away with all evening?
If you give me one more minute ..
─ For what?
To save a city that is already lost?
Don't you know we couldn't save the city now with five gallons of that blood?
I tell you the truth before God, Captain.
I just hope that my officers scare the enemy as much as they do me.
Now you come with me.
I've got a job for you.
Attention!
Attention!
Silence!
You have had the bad judgment to be born in the wrong country ..
In the wrong year, and on the wrong side.
And so it is with the greatest regret.
That I'm now going to play a very dirty trick on you.
In order to gain time, I'm going to send you south.
To meet your friends who have set out to overthrow their government by force.
But then, these friends will also play a very dirty trick on you.
Having rewritten one of the cardinal rules of warfare.
They do not take prisoners.
They will shoot you.
Such, unhappily .. is the nature of war.
In this new era of dirty tricks.
But the government you have tried to betray.
Have no intention of permitting you to be murdered in cold blood like that.
The minute you are fired upon, you will be given rifles.
You will then have the privilege of deciding for yourselves.
Whether you want to fire back at your friends.
Or just stand there and have your tails shot off.
This will be the final dirty trick.
Long live The Republic.
Good luck Captain.
If you run into the Generalissimo, give him my regards.
We fought together in Africa.
Prisoners, attention!
Have you ever covered a civil war?
It's like trying to make love in revolving door.
Prisoners fall out!
But keep close to the road.
Did he really tell you where it was?
And if the General hadn't come in, I should have told him.
You would have?
I would have had to.
But I would have deserved it, anyway.
─ No, no.
How could anybody be so stupid?
It was just too clever for us.
What do you think you can do about it?
─ I don't know.
They'll never get it.
─ Give me your hands.
Who says so?
─ Comrade Captain says so.
Attention!
This way everybody.
Come along!
This man was sentenced to be executed this morning.
For treason.
The sentence will now be carried out.
All prisoners will keep their eyes to the front.
I want you to see what happens to a man who tries to betray his country.
Alright, comrades.
Ready .. aim ..
Fire!
[ pistol shot ]
If only I could get it away from them.
The Generals and the Bishops.
Using it as an instrument of war to make men kill each other.
If I could get it away from this insanity.
Save it from such desecration.
Is this Basalles?
No.
We won't be at Basalles until tomorrow night.
Is that where you're going to broadcast?
─ That's what the script says.
God is very patient isn't he.
There is no end to his patience.
Do you think he'll understand me?
I believe so.
It won't be easy.
I don't suppose there are any easy ones for Him.
I've always believed in God, and the Holy Mother.
But I've never been sure about Priests.
Once I saw the Pope in Barcelona, when I was a little girl.
I wasn't sure about him, either.
You mean the Cardinal.
─ No.
The Pope.
Everybody said he was the Pope.
He certainly looked like him.
What about this?
You and me?
Do you think he'll understand that?
We leave Him to decide about that.
I'm sure he'll do what is right.
I'm afraid he'll have to do a little better than that.
Will you hear my confession, Father?
I'm not a priest any longer.
Please Father, bless me.
I have sinned.
I am not a Priest.
─ Please, Father.
What's the matter?
Have you never seen a priest with a girl in his arms?
[ latin blessing ]
There is my little village.
Where I was going back one day.
Remember?
Inside.
Alright Mac.
─ Hi uncle.
Nice trip?
This is Major Garcia, from Madrid.
─ Nice to see you.
I am sure Señor Hawthorne understands the necessity.
I'm covering the battle, not the politics.
Am I liable to get my head shot off?
If you insist on broadcasting a battle, you can't do it from too far, can you.
I didn't insist.
I was "insisted" all the way from New York.
How far is our setup from here?
We've got the cable in a field just down this road.
About three kilometers behind the line.
─ Well, that sounds cozy enough.
Comrade Hawthorne is reminded that he is to make no reference to how he got here.
Be of good heart, Captain.
All them messages will be observed until I'm well over the border.
Go on.
You miss her very much, don't you.
Miss whom?
─ Your wife.
Your fair bride.
Why do you say that?
─ I can tell.
And you'll miss her even more tomorrow.
─ Don't talk like that.
Not tonight.
She's the one you want to be with tomorrow but you can only have one of us.
You are the only bride I have.
The only thing I have in the world .. or want.
Perhaps.
Perhaps I can help you decide.
Perhaps I can make your choice for you.
─ If you please, Señorita.
Oh not again.
─ The comrade Captain wants to see you.
Doesn't this shagger ever give up?
How can you be such a fool?
How long do you think it could last?
Priests and children always return home when night falls.
He can't go back.
─ Not if he's never been away.
I don't believe that.
Has he had a moment of decision yet?
Then how can he be so sure?
Don't you think you should find out before it's too late?
We're going to move up at 4 o'clock.
After that of course, you'll never know.
Will that be all?
If you say so.
Captain.
Yes, Señorita?
On second thoughts.
Of course.
Those guns you hear now are the rebel guns.
They're big ones.
Such a barrage is usually a prelude to an advance or an attack.
But any serious ground action at this moment seems most unlikely.
Darling.
What happened?
─ I wanted to be with you tonight.
You alright?
─ Yes.
I am alright.
If only we .. if only we could fly away from here before the morning.
I can.
The same offer?
─ Yes.
What did you tell him?
I told him I'd try.
That doesn't mean that I'd tell him.
What does it mean?
I could tell him something else and then ..
And then I'd get it and take it away ..
like you said.
Take it where?
─ Wherever you said.
Away from here.
That's what you meant, wasn't it?
Away from war.
You .. you really think you could do it?
I think so.
I could try.
Supposing.
Supposing you were caught.
I ..
I'd just keep on lying to him.
I'd never tell him the truth.
Do you think it would be alright if I took it to my village in the mountains?
It would be safely away from everything.
Do you think it would be safe there?
─ I would stay there with it.
No .. no ..
Don't you trust me?
You know better than that.
I don't want you to be caught.
─ I won't be.
Have you got a pocket?
─ Yes.
Would you be too afraid to have it on you?
No.
I'd be afraid, but not too afraid.
Quiet .. careful, the socialists are just ahead.
Comrade.
I want to see the comrade Captain.
Wait here.
Can you see anything out there?
─ No.
I thought I heard something.
─ That woman wants to see you again.
Oh.
Thank you, comrade.
Well?
How can I get away?
─ The same way you got here.
Straight back up this road to the city.
Where is it?
Still in the Cathedral.
In the same place, in the high altar.
Very good .. we'll go together and get it.
But I want to leave now.
I'm scared!
You'll go back up with us tomorrow after we've delivered the others into the line.
Is there a sentry forward?
─ Yes, comrade.
But you told me I could get away from here tonight!
I told you no such thing.
What's his name?
─ Vincenté.
Hey, Vincenté.
Fire up some horses.
I want to go!
─ Vincenté.
Vincenté!
You in the Church!
Throw your weapons out!
I give you one minute to throw everything you've got out.
We're prisoners, we're unarmed.
We have no weapons.
How many are you?
─ About two hundred.
Will you let me come out and explain, alone?
Alright .. come out with your hands up.
This way.
What do you mean "prisoners"?
Whose prisoners?
─ Nationalist prisoners.
These are our guards.
We're being taken up to the front to be killed.
What kind of filth is that?
Why couldn't they kill you where you were?
They want to use us as a cover for their retreat.
They'll give us rifles and we've got to dig the trenches.
Where are the rifles?
─ In that truck there.
And you say that there are two hundred men in there?
Yes.
Then you've got nearly two companies of men in there.
Yes, but they're not soldiers.
They're unarmed civilians.
Civilians?
Two hundred civilians hiding in a church behind the lines?
They were prisoners.
They were compelled to do what they were told.
Have you any proof of that?
Ask them.
─ They're filth.
What good would that do?
How could I tell if they were lying or not?
Listen to me, please.
It's no use.
I can't take a chance like that.
I hate to shoot two hundred men, but I don't know what else to do.
I'm already one hour and a half behind schedule.
Captain.
You don't mean that, do you.
Of course I mean it.
This is a battle and I've got orders to follow.
There's no provision for two hundred prisoners.
And I'm certainly not going to leave that many men loose behind me.
I'd be shot myself if I did a thing like that.
But you can't shoot them!
They're not the enemy.
They're friends of the rebellion and members of the church.
I will leave this to you, Captain.
It's a filthy job.
But I've simply got to get this column moving again.
You'll have to shoot them in batches with a machine-gun I suppose.
Who are these?
That's the guard.
Ask them.
Don't talk nonsense.
What else could they do but lie?
Shoot them first.
─ What about confessions?
What confessions?
Confession must be granted to all who ask for it.
Those are the Generalissimo's orders.
─ There are two hundred men in there.
We have to confess two hundred men?
─ All who wish it.
Very well .. get on with it.
But I'm afraid that means you're going be here for the rest of the night.
Adiós.
─ Adiós.
May I make one suggestion, Captain?
─ Yes.
Will you let me finish all the confessions first?
As dreadful enough as it is without such gunfire.
Of course.
Captain.
These are all true Catholics.
I myself was on a sacred mission taking a Holy Relic to a place of safety.
What Holy Relic?
The relic of the Cathedral.
The Blood of St John.
Where is it?
I haven't got it.
I sent it away.
─ But how?
I thought you said you were all prisoners.
If you'll let me explain to you.
You must think me very simple, Señor.
But it is God's truth, Captain.
─ Then show me the Relic.
Since you sent it away, perhaps you can bring it back?
Then it will be not only God's truth .. but also his will.
Father, is there nothing you can do about this?
No.
Even in uniform a Priest's influence is effective only in spiritual matters.
I want you to summon up all the courage that you can.
The decision is that we shall be .. executed.
This is the Chaplain who will hear the confessions of those who wish it.
Will all who wish to confess, raise their hands.
Arturo.
Shoot straight Señors.
Fire!
You've got two hundred more men to kill.
─ What are you doing out here?
Two hundred more innocent men to kill!
─ Come on, get back in there.
Who are you going to answer to for that?
Your God or your Major?
Two hundred murders!
[ confession.
Latin ]
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.
Go on, please.
It is two weeks since I last confessed.
Since then I have loved a woman.
So long as you loved her in God.
But I am a Priest, Father.
A lot of us are to be killed.
You understand that.
Not all of us.
Some will get away.
Still willing?
May God have mercy on your souls.
Wait.
Arturo.
I lost it.
Is this over?
No .. it is just the beginning.
Do you think He will really understand?
I think so.
About you, too?
I'll ask him too.
I loved you, Arturo.
I loved you, Soledad.
Bless me, Father.
[ Hawthorne ] "I had found an end to my story."

T-G
Hello.
Hawthorne here.
Oh New York .. well, put him on.
Hello Charlie, how are you?
Me?
Oh fine .. fine.
No, nothing new.
Oh sure there are disturbances.
A few guys getting killed here and there.
Well, that doesn't add up to a Revolution.
Listen Charlie .. the Generalissimo will never get this far north.
Sure, sure I'm working.
What do you want me to do?
Invent a war for you?
I know.
I know you need copy.
Color stories, huh?
Human interest, yeah.
Sure .. sure, I'll dig up something.
Okay, Charlie.
Where the devil am I going to find a human interest story?
"But the fact is a story was beginning.
Though I didn't know it then."
"At twelve o'clock, the Bishop summoned a young Priest named Arturo Carrera."
Good day Monsignor.
- Good day, Father.
Good day Arturo.
I do not see how we can keep our eyes closed to the situation any longer.
There comes a time, when we must take a stand.
Read this .. read it out loud.
I want to hear how it sounds.
Entry to this house of God, is forbidden to immodestly dressed women ..
Whose frocks do not cover their elbows and their knees.
Yes.
Very good, very good.
Now I want to translate it into German, into English, and into Italian ..
And post it on the door today.
Is this all we have to be concerned within the Church today?
What is the matter?
- Women's elbows and knees?
Did you know that one tried to come in last week.
In what I believe are called .. "shorts".
Better in shorts I would have thought, than not at all.
Monsignor.
Have you forgotten that fewer than 15% of the workers attend mass here anymore?
And that where we once had "love" and "trust" we know have downright hatred.
Does no-one in the Church ever ask themselves the reason for this?
Well, there are certain proprieties that ..
- Monsignor.
The Church in Spain is falling to pieces.
All Spain seems to be falling to pieces.
Tomorrow it may be the world.
I don't mean to be impertinent.
At a time like this when one Church after another is being burned or destroyed.
And another priest murdered every day.
Have we really nothing better to worry about but a few knees and elbows?
The Church of God my son, is like a net let down into the sea.
Then why doesn't it catch more fish?
Whatever your intentions Father, you are being impertinent.
Very impertinent.
Let us all pray to God to give those people back their faith.
They haven't lost faith in God.
They've lost it in us, the Church.
We failed them.
They look to us for protection against injustice and this is answer we give them.
A preposterous reminder there are parts of a woman's body that Bishops disapprove.
Why shouldn't they look to other people for help and hope?
I wonder if you know the seriousness of what you are saying, Father?
I think I do, Monsignor ..
I've thought about this for a long time.
Then there is no excuse for you to confuse the eternity of the Church.
With the weaknesses and failures of its members.
Or to forget that for every failure.
There is a martyred Priest whose blood is the very seed of the Church.
How do I know they were martyrs?
- Arturo, please!
Why weren't they simply just fools?
- I've been patient with you, Father.
How do I know they didn't die for a myth?
Or for a ghost?
A ghost of a dead church.
A cause isn't necessarily true because a man dies for it.
His dying merely proved that he believed in it.
Not that he wasn't a fool to do so.
Arturo, my son.
Will you kneel with me and ask God for forgiveness?
I cannot ..
I cannot bring myself to believe.
That this Church is serving either God or man today.
I cannot believe that God himself is impressed by the platitudes and piety.
Than the people here are.
I can't.
In the Seminary ..
I was taught.
Love and deeds.
I was taught that the poor and the dirty were as important in His eyes ..
As the owners of Hispano-Suizas and great yachts.
The truth is that nothing .. nothing!
Nothing I was taught in the Seminary has been of any value to me here whatsoever.
And more and more I find myself sharing the workers' feelings.
This is not the Church of our fathers.
This is a different Church.
A Church I don't understand or respect.
And what is worse ..
A Church in which I can find no way of serving Him, as I was taught to serve Him.
Don't go any further, Arturo.
It may not be so easy to un-say the things you are saying.
Or to undo such a rash and wicked act.
May God forgive me if I am wrong.
But I can accept this Church no longer.
I must find another way.
Arturo.
Get off the line Operator or Censor, or whoever.
I'm talking to New York.
Of Continental Broadcasting Company.
Hello New York?
Charlie?
I haven't talked to Madrid this morning, but I can tell you it is just a rumor.
Certainly, that is an air-raid siren.
So what?
Every time three seagulls fly over this place, some drunk pushes the button.
I want to make a little correction here.
That joker wasn't drunk this time, and ..
Those aren't seagulls dropping this stuff.
This is the "kick-off" Charlie-boy!
The war is on!
Oh, dear mother of God.
I don't want to die.
Will you let her sit down please?
Let her sit down for a moment.
This is the new Crusade.
To put to rout the enemies of the Church.
If the Crusaders don't blow us up first.
Of course.
They won't hit the churches.
I hope not.
But during the Rif War they invariably killed everybody they set out to rescue.
Have you jacket and trousers?
Of sorts, Monsignor.
People will be angry after this and attack us again.
But this time .. they will destroy our Cathedral.
Don't say that, Monsignor.
But one thing they must not destroy.
They must not destroy our Holy Relic.
The blessed Blood of St John.
So after this is over.
Change into your jacket and trousers for no priest will be safe in the streets.
Then you will take our Holy Relic out of here.
And deliver it to our friends, who are fighting for Our Lord.
And against this wicked government.
I don't want to be alone.
- Is it very bad out there?
Horrible.
- Perhaps I can do something to help.
Don't go away please, there is a doctor and some soldiers near.
Please don't leave me alone.
- Alright, I won't.
I'll be alright in a minute.
Thank you.
You alright now?
No, I'm not alright, but I am better.
Were you as scared as I was?
More scared I'd say.
Oh no, that is impossible.
Nobody can be that scared.
I wonder .. if there might be another way out of here.
You might try through there.
Oh yes, let's try.
Aren't you coming, too?
Oh .. yes, in a moment or two.
I should mind my own business, huh?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
It's just that ..
I'm the only person who can help myself, at the moment.
I know .. sometimes, I feel like that.
Perhaps .. perhaps you need someone to talk to.
I wish I had.
You're not married?
- No.
Well, that is a part of it.
You are lonely.
- Yes, perhaps.
Adiós.
- Arturo.
Arturo .. mine is Soledad.
- Adiós, Soledad.
[ tannoy ] "Attention comrades.
Bulletin number five."
"It has now been established that today's inhuman and barbarous attack on our city."
"Was guided by traitor priests."
"Signaling to the flying gangsters from the towers of the churches."
"One hundred and fifty-five deaths have already been reported."
"Including fifty-eight women and seventeen children."
Comrades .. comrades .. comrades!
The Priests did it!
The priests are on the wrong side.
On to the Cathedral!
We must get with the soldiers who've come to protect us.
To their leaders.
Do you think you can do this, Father?
- I will Monsignor.
I promise you.
I'm sure you will.
[ tannoy ] "Attention comrades to bulletin number ten."
"Two of the traitor priests of the have escaped and are at large in the city."
"Priest Arturo Carrera."
"Was recognized at the Corria Goncorra at 9 o'clock, wearing a black suit."
"Carrera is about 35 years of age, and of medium height."
"Priest Isidro Rota is short and fat."
"And reported to be wearing clothes of a rather sporting character."
"These men are murderers and enemies of The Republic."
"And any citizen failing to do his full duty towards their apprehension."
"Will himself be punished as a traitor."
"Long live The Republic!"
[ police whistle ]
Your order, Señor?
Beer.
Afraid somebody will see you here?
No.
Wouldn't you like to go someplace where it is more private?
In one of the boxes?
They are not expensive.
Alright.
Now, if you excuse me Passion-flower, I must get back to my unpleasant work.
But is that good for an eyeball?
Water?
It's not water, honey.
It is English gin.
Very antiseptic.
I have to make a broadcast at 3 o'clock.
That's 9 o'clock New York time.
But do you need four eyeballs?
Every one-eyed gentleman needs at least four for routine social demands.
This one has a rather wicked glint in it, for leering at you girls after midnight.
This one?
Has a good, clean honest look.
For dealing with mothers.
This one?
This one is simply bloodshot.
- What is that?
This one is for patriotic occasions.
That's an American flag on the pupils.
A tribute to God's country impossible for the old-fashioned, two-eyed man.
Well, Adiós dear Soledad.
- Adiós, Uncle.
What's the name of that girl down there?
Would you like to buy me a little drink?
- Not tonight Señorita.
A call for you in number three.
Who is he?
- I don't know.
I never saw him before.
Already?
[ tannoy ] "Attention comrades."
"The priest Carrera has been recognized in the last hour in the Plaza del Sol"
"He has discarded his jacket, and now wears black trouser and a white shirt."
Did you follow me here?
- No.
Then, what are you doing here?
You told me I was lonely.
Yes I know, but I didn't want to meet in a place like this.
I was only joking.
I just came in here to get away from all the trouble out there.
Yes, I know.
Isn't it terrible?
All this shooting, bombing and burning everything.
What's it all about?
Do you know?
- It's a revolt against the government.
Whatever it is, I wish they'd leave the churches alone.
I don't care what they do to the priests, but it is bad luck to burn churches.
Just look at that.
Usually we have twice as many people on a Thursday night.
Look, why don't you go to the café and wait for me there?
It won't take me a minute to change.
Would you mind if we just stayed here, and talked for a while first?
Just talk?
That's all, yes.
You see, that's the trouble.
That's why I'm sorry you came here, because ..
If you like somebody and they find you in a place like this.
Well, they might get the wrong idea.
You know, people don't always understand about people.
No.
I know.
Working here doesn't make me any different.
It's just a job to me.
Do you know that I don't know half the names of these fellows.
You see what I mean?
- Yes, yes.
I see.
I need a drink.
Whose drink is this?
- I bought it for that other girl.
Oh .. thank you darling.
Health, pesetas, and love for two.
Now what?
Everybody remain where you are.
And be ready with your identification papers.
Just the men.
What's this all about?
They're looking for a priest.
- A priest in here?
How do you like that?
A priest in a cabaret.
I hope they don't beat him up in here.
That will really ruin the whole night.
Will they come up here?
- Well, I suppose so.
Why?
Aren't your papers alright?
I haven't got any papers.
They're at home.
In your cassock.
Get downstairs.
I don't want you here when they come.
No wonder you were so worried.
Get downstairs.
It will only mean trouble for us both.
Wait, I know a way.
Come on.
You don't want to be beaten up, do you?
- Or to get you into trouble either.
Go in there.
Come on.
You are very brave, but you are also very foolish.
So are you .. come on.
Alright.
Come on, let's see your papers.
Come on, come on.
We're alright now.
It is just across the street.
Come on, come on.
Alright, come on, let's see your papers.
This way Señorita.
Not tonight Caballero.
I've already got a fellow.
I know that fellow, and it's not a priest he is usually after.
Wait here.
[ gunshots ]
Two to one, they shot the wrong fellow.
Well, it is not The Ritz of course but ..
Guess who?
Which one?
This is me, and that is my little sister.
She's married now.
I'm going back there some day when I've saved enough money.
Where's that?
It's a little village in the mountains.
You wouldn't know it.
I'm supposed to be a dressmaker.
You know you are risking your life doing this, don't you?
Oh, I doubt that.
I'll move in with the girl upstairs and tomorrow we'll get you out of here.
Anyone who helps the priests is equally guilty.
The announcements said that.
Those shaggers don't frighten me, Father.
I thought you didn't like priests.
I didn't know you were a priest.
I'm not any more.
Will you say that again.
- I said I'm not a priest any longer.
I left the church this morning.
Left it?
How?
I just walked out.
That's all.
But you can't do that .. can you?
You not only can, but you must if you faith has failed you.
Well, I've never heard of anything like that before in my life.
Have you got a back way out of here?
Back way?
For what?
- I cannot stay here.
Why not?
You're not a priest any more.
You said so yourself.
It's too dangerous.
It's not dangerous now.
They've already checked.
It's not the end.
They'll be checking the houses next.
But I won't let them in.
The door is locked.
There's a mob out there.
They'll break down the door.
Alright.
Let's push this against ..
- It's no use ..
They know I'm in this quarter.
It's only hours before they check every room.
Don't you like me?
Yes.
Very much.
Is it because I'm a cabaret girl?
- Please try and understand me.
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened for us both!
Why do you think I brought you here?
Because you're very kind and brave.
You pity me even though you dislike priests.
Did I know you were a priest when you came in the Bar Michel?
Did I?
Did I know you were a priest tonight when you came in the cabaret?
I brought you here because of some people said.
I don't know what.
Something said this is a very special person.
That you should take care of him and not let him get hurt.
Because some day he'll be very important.
And I tell you this before God himself.
I'll come back.
No you won't.
- I promise you.
I promise you I will.
No you won't.
No.
Because ..
Because you know there is no danger now.
But I'm not good enough for you.
I'm a whore.
Please, please believe me.
- Get out!
- Please.
Get out!
If you'll tell me how.
Which is the back way?
Find it yourself.
I'm very sorry Soledad.
Once a priest, always a priest.
Open up in there!
This is the Militia!
Open up!
Stay here and keep quiet.
- But what will they do?
It doesn't matter what they do.
Stay here and keep quiet.
You understand me?
Open up in there!
I'm sorry.
Open up.
Come in.
I'm Carrera.
The man you want.
Alright .. come on.
[ tannoy ] "Today our loyal Army fights two forces."
"The rebel troops approaching the city from the south."
"And the secret enemy within the city."
"Five priests and other rebel sympathizers"
"Who are working to spread fear and defeat among us."
"Both forces will be destroyed!"
[ Hawthorne ] "But there was another force that no army could fight."
"The unhappy hearts of a people wondering where the relic of St John had vanished."
"It led me, for reasons of my own."
"To visit the local prison."
Arturo Carrera?
Yes.
- My name is Hawthorne.
Continental Broadcasting Company.
- Yes.
I understand you withdrew from the church yesterday.
I'm sorry.
It is not a subject I want to discuss for publication.
It is not for publication.
I represent another interest at the moment.
Did you desert your church because you lost your faith in God?
No.
Of course not.
- You can speak quite freely with me.
I'm an infidel.
What interest?
Would you be willing to serve him outside the church?
Naturally, that would be my hope, but ..
Would you be willing to discuss your position with a member of the government?
If you can't tell me who you represent, there is nothing to say to each other.
I'm sorry.
You leave something to be desired when an effort is being made to rescue you.
[ Hawthorne ] "By now, I knew that Carrera was my big story."
"And the path to him led through the Commandant."
Alright then, let's approach it from another angle.
You are wasting your time with anything you have to say on behalf of a priest.
What is being offered here, Captain.
Is an opportunity to serve your government on a global scale.
Strike the chains from this convertible priest.
Give him a small office.
A modest title.
And you will have reshaped the thinking of the world single-handed.
Never again will they be able to say that you shoot priests like rabbits.
You misunderstand, Mr Hawthorne.
It is traitors and not priests, that we shoot like rabbits.
When there is no war and the priests are confined to their churchly duties.
They would be of no more interest to me ..
Than so many fortune-tellers and witch-doctors.
But as long as they plot and plan against their legal government.
They are spies working for the enemies of that government.
And will be dealt with as such.
Does that make my position clear?
- You sound prejudiced to me.
Indeed I am.
Prejudiced against an institution that has ridden on the backs of our people.
Since the time of The Inquisition.
You're the Intelligence Officer here?
- Yes, comrade General.
I'm General Clavé, the new Commander.
What's this blood business on the walls?
What blood business?
- Chalked over the walls, everywhere.
"Where is St somebody's blood?"
Has the enemy got St somebody's blood?
I saw it a dozen times on the way from the airport.
With your permission, Captain.
It's a local religious legend, General.
The Holy Relic in the Cathedral here, was a drop of blood shed by St John.
It has been working miracles here since time immemorial.
One of the beliefs is ..
Whoever holds it cannot be defeated.
- What nonsense.
Napoleon's words exactly outside this very city in 1812.
Just before being driven back over the horizon.
That's right, by George.
I remember now.
The only defeat he suffered in Spain.
Where is it?
- That's the big question now.
It seems to have disappeared during the patriotic bonfire last night.
And the news in beginning to disturb some of the apprentice atheists.
May I ask who you are?
- Mr Hawthorne is a radio broadcaster.
I'm sorry, I don't talk to journalists.
Will you excuse us please.
Certainly comrade General.
Is that true what he said?
- I'm sure it is.
A relic like that can exert a powerful influence in a place like this.
It is what priests have done to Spain.
- Dammit, I've never seen such war.
People all the same color, same language.
I can't tell one crowd from the other.
Now, somebody's blood.
What was his name?
- St John.
Local fellow?
Some centuries ago, I believe.
- Absolutely ridiculous.
Get out and shut that door.
This is confidential.
We've got to pull out of here.
- Already?
There is no way to defend this place.
It is a bloody trap.
These troops we've got here.
The militia men, they are not really soldiers.
Just civilians with rifles, and half of them are no more than schoolboys.
They are very brave, comrade General.
- Brave but inaccurate.
But I am going to need your help Captain.
I'm a little rusty at this business.
I retired from the Army ten years ago and haven't read a newspaper since.
They have a lot of new ideas these days.
- Have you?
I thought so.
They never left well enough alone, do they?
No, not if they think they can do better.
- That's it exactly.
The mistake they all make.
Trying to improve things.
In the old days .. war made sense.
One country fought another country, attired in different uniforms.
Our crowd spoke Spanish while the others jabbered away in something else.
A very simple situation.
If you couldn't understand what the other fellow was saying, you shot him.
But the way it is today ..
I think that we should get this relic comrade General.
What relic?
- The Holy Relic of St John.
You really think it will work?
- In a way.
It's a matter of morale.
- Morale?
That's another piece of nonsense they've cooked up since I left.
In the old days, you simply told your men to get out there and fight.
And they got out there and fought.
Not "why" just "whom".
You really knew where you stood in those days, by George.
Excuse me comrade General, but about this relic?
Do you know what I think we ought to do about that relic, Captain?
What?
- Get it.
A relic like that can exert a powerful influence in a place like this.
It's what the priests have done to Spain.
- I'll go after it at once, General.
Don't just go after it.
Get it.
- Yes, comrade General.
It's a matter of morale.
- Of course.
Here.
Go in.
Shut the door.
You seem to have lost your faith at a very convenient moment, Father.
I don't expect you to believe me, but the process has been going on for some time.
Then you are an atheist now?
- No.
It was my faith in the church which failed.
Not my faith in God.
It's a curious thing that two priests went missing from the Cathedral.
It is more curious that the Holy Relic in the Church was also missing.
Can you explain that to me?
No ..
I didn't know it was missing.
I suggest to you that one of those priests ..
Either you or Canon Rota ..
Was ordered by your Bishop ..
To take it and deliver it to Franco and his rebels.
I know nothing about it.
I had left the Cathedral before the attack came.
But why are you so interested in it?
I didn't know that atheists placed any importance in .. in religious symbols.
We don't .. but we know that an ignorant mob of renegade Christians do.
And always will.
This relic could become less a symbol than a weapon.
Like a hidden battery of artillery.
When did you last see Canon Rota?
You mean, your men are already disturbed by it?
People are always disturbed about something.
Perhaps they would be less disturbed if their hearts were not ignored.
Yes .. you are still a Christian.
Still preaching.
If I may make a suggestion, Captain.
You know nothing about Christians.
Particularly renegade Christians.
Otherwise, you would know what to do about their disturbance.
You mean, you do?
Yes, I think I do ..
I think I know very well what to do.
And if I can make another suggestion ..
I would like to do it.
You would like to do something for the socialists?
No ..
I'd like to do something for the men, the ones that are troubled.
I'd like to comfort them.
I'd like to be a missionary to the hearts of your ignorant and troubled Army.
What happened?
Did you find him?
- I told you I would, didn't I.
Is he alright?
- Oh, sure.
They didn't beat him up again, did they?
He's probably the most un-beat-up priest in the diocese today.
But what is all this?
Don't tell me you are in love with this whirling dervish?
Are you crazy?
How can I be in love with a priest?
I was just worried about him.
Besides, he's not a Priest any more.
With his current spiritual status, you won't have to worry about him for a time.
What do you mean?
- He's joined the management.
Joined what management?
The government.
The department of worried atheists.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard of.
A priest going over to the heathens?
Would you be good enough to move just a little bit to your left?
How would you like to lose the other one?
The aims of Socialism are exactly the same as the aims of the Church.
They follow different paths, but the destination is the same.
Man's happiness.
I think if you keep this in mind, it may help you.
[ tannoy ] "Although our troops continue their courageous resistance."
"We have been obliged to rectify our lines in certain sectors."
How far would you say, Captain?
Fifty or sixty kilometers.
The opposition tonight says forty.
The Continental Broadcasting Company won't have a correspondent here long ..
If he continues to listen to the enemy wireless.
The Continental is trying to be fair and impartial, Captain.
It hates both sides.
Are there any plans to rectify our lines by getting the hell out of here?
On the contrary.
We're already preparing a counter-attack.
Reinforcements are arriving from Barcelona tonight,
And the city is in no danger whatever.
Soledad.
Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
But I didn't know the soldiers were that close.
If I had known I ..
I could've got you out.
I swear I could.
- I'm sure you could have.
But everything is alright now.
That's why I am here.
To tell you about it.
But .. you are not angry?
No.
Not in the least .. would you like to hear what happened?
Yes, I would .. very much .. come on in.
Would you like to talk some more about it?
- Yes.
Very much.
Come on.
The situation isn't likely to arise after all.
Any more questions?
About the "Holy Relic", what they call the "blessed blood".
Is it true that if we haven't got it, we will be defeated?
The Holy Relic has a place in many hearts.
But it will never have anything to do with victory or defeat.
Not even the church can tell you that.
I don't understand him anyway.
If you want help, come and see me.
You know where I am.
Thank you.
I need some help too, Arturo.
I'm sorry comrade.
I sleep in what's left of the Cathedral.
If you could come up there, some night ..
late ..
I can't.
It's impossible.
I don't think I can last much longer.
Please go away.
I'm not going to report you, but don't try to see me again.
He's a fool and he always was, coming to me in a public place like that.
Endangering both our lives.
- What did he want?
Help, he said.
I could have helped him there.
How can I go to the Cathedral?
They are watching me all the time.
You mean now?
- Perhaps not now at this moment.
But they must keep an eye on me.
I'm a renegade priest.
I suppose he had no-one else to go to.
- That's what worries me.
Nobody liked him.
But it's not your fault, darling.
There was nothing you could do, really.
- I should have done something.
It's just that I'm not certain of things yet.
I shall know better, soon.
Is that what you think?
- What do you mean?
Why, just because you got a late start.
I don't know why you expect to be less mixed up than everybody else.
This is a nice place.
It's so peaceful.
[ gunshots!
]
Well .. at least it used to be, anyway.
They're rounding up deserters again.
Or digging out members of the fifth column.
I quit this morning.
Quit?
- The cabaret.
You said you understood, but you didn't really.
I wish I knew ..
How to tell you ..
How I feel about you.
Is it good?
Yes, it is very good.
Do you really like me?
That's what I wish I knew how to tell you.
How much.
How much.
That I feel .. awkward and clumsy like a schoolboy.
If I tell you something.
You won't laugh?
- No.
I promise.
I like that.
Because it makes me feel like a schoolgirl.
You won't laugh, now?
- No, I'm not laughing.
I'll tell you something else.
You are the first person I've ..
I've ever really known in my life.
The very first.
You promised you wouldn't laugh.
- Uhuh.
This must be the way.
Young girls feel.
When they've just met a wonderful boy.
And they just .. touch hands.
And can't say anything.
I once saw my little sister like that.
She'd just sit with this boy and ..
Not say a word.
Neither one of them.
And every now and then, they'd giggle.
I cried myself to sleep the first night I saw that.
Don't.
Don't say it unless you really mean it.
I mean it.
And if .. if you are not sure?
If you don't know yet ..
I'll wait.
But if you do say it, and don't mean it ..
I'll want to die.
Because this will never happen to me again .. not like this.
I love you.
Say it again.
I love you.
Like my little sister and that little boy.
The same, but more so.
And you won't be sorry?
You're sure?
That's what I keep on asking myself.
How can I be so certain .. so soon.
But you know, a priest doesn't live in a vacuum.
He may not share in all of life.
But it's not a stranger to him.
His ears and eyes and thoughts.
And you're not the first woman I've ever seen.
Or talked to.
Or thought about.
Just the first I've ever loved.
The first I've ever wanted to spend my whole life with.
Is that a full battalion?
- All that's left of it, comrade General.
More desertions?
- Yes, comrade General.
You think it's that Relic?
- I'm afraid the rebels have it.
Where is that Intelligence Officer?
What is his name?
Comrade Captain Botargus.
Go and get him.
- Yes, comrade General.
Intelligence officer ..
What a war.
We will move the second battalion out at midnight.
That's the last man I'm going to waste in this bloody trap.
What about the prisoners, comrade General?
The order from Madrid?
How many have we got here?
- About two hundred.
Very well.
Call them in here at 2 o'clock and we'll send them down the line as roadblock.
It's a dirty trick sticking civilians into the trenches.
But that seems to be the whole art of winning wars these days.
Successful dirty tricks.
Father Rota?
Father?
Father Rota?
Don't be frightened, Father.
I'm a friend of Arturo's.
Father Arturo.
I ..
I brought you some food.
I'll put it here for you.
He wanted to come himself.
He wanted to help you but he's still being watched.
They don't really trust him.
But if there is anything I can do for you.
If you will just tell me?
Alright, I'll leave you alone now.
I'm sorry I frightened you.
Goodnight, Father.
Run Father!
Run!
Thank you Señorita for leading us so promptly to the man we were after.
Has she been searched?
- Thoroughly, comrade Captain.
You are in a very serious situation here, Señorita.
The charge against that priest is treason.
Now, what were you doing with him?
Exactly what I told your friend.
I took him some food.
Don't lie to me.
- I'm no lying to you!
He was a hungry old man and I took him something to eat.
I know he's a priest and I shouldn't have done that.
Hungry old priests should starve to death!
That's all there was to it.
What more can I tell you?
What did you say to him?
What did he say to you?
He said nothing to me.
Not even "thank you" for the food.
What did the Reverend Arturo tell you say to him?
Who is the Reverend Arturo?
How would you like to be questioned with instruments?
What more can I tell you if I don't know anything?
You have no idea how many people manage to remember things they never knew.
Until a few of their finger-nails are pulled out.
If I were you, I would think this whole situation over again.
Don't you worry about it.
I'll write the letter for you.
Just tell me what you want me to tell her and where she lives.
San Amantina.
Twenty.
Arturo.
Wait a minute.
Is it true that a Priest never loses his Holy powers, regardless of what he does?
That's what the Church says.
And you for example, can still hear a confession and give absolution?
Yes .. under certain circumstances.
Come with me.
One moment, Captain.
I'm no longer a Priest.
And I've no intention of pretending to be one.
Not even for an old friend and associate who has asked for you?
The Reverend Canon Rota is to be executed in the morning.
Would you deny him his final consolation?
The Canon is a brave man.
There are no limits to my admiration for a brave man.
Even a Priest.
If a man has a fancy for such nonsense.
- One more thing.
You'll be wasting your time if you think you'll be shown secrets of a confession.
Even by an apostolic priest.
- My dear Arturo.
You are being much too suspicious.
The hiding of a holy relic is hardly a thing to be confessed.
Now go in, please.
And get it over with.
I'm very sorry, Father.
- No.
This is very kind of you.
Have you any news of the young woman?
What young woman?
The one you sent with the food.
Is that how they caught you in the Cathedral?
Didn't you know?
Did they arrest the young woman too?
Yes.
Didn't you send her?
Then I'm afraid I've put you in a very cruel position.
I thought you had changed.
No.
I was hoping you might do this last service to the Blessed Relic.
I won't even discuss that with you.
There is nobody else.
I'm no longer a member of the Church and you know that.
Do you want me to confess you or not?
Forgive me, Father.
Of course I do.
You never believed in it anyway, did you?
No.
- Neither did I.
I was either too stupid or not stupid enough.
I don't know which.
All those miracles.
But now I do.
Walking the streets all this time.
Hiding in crowds, listening to the whispers.
I learned something.
Have you seen what they write on the walls?
Yes.
They are terrified, Arturo.
They've got no God, now.
They've been emancipated from all that.
All they've got now ..
Is this sad little secret faith in a drop of blood.
That has been as much a part of their lives ..
As their fathers and mothers.
It's like a little lamp in their hearts that nobody else knows about.
And as long as they can look inside and see its light and feel its warmth.
They know that the way home is still open.
Now it is flickering and they are frightened.
if it goes out .. they will be like little children lost in the dark.
That's why the rest of them died.
God rest their dear souls.
To keep it burning.
- The rest of whom died?
Our brothers.
All of them?
Didn't you know, really?
No.
I thought they had been arrested.
That's what I was told.
They were.
All but Peres and Desidro.
Who died in the Church.
And Monsignor?
He wouldn't tell them.
The others ..
I don't know how they stood it.
I don't know how they kept from giving in.
When you are in pain like this.
They pulled out my nails.
Nothing.
In either heaven or earth ..
Seems worth it.
Bless me Father .. for I have sinned.
I've changed my mind.
Where is it?
Was a young woman brought down here?
- Not down here.
God, we wanted seagulls this time.
That was a pretty long confession.
- Where is Señorita Soledad?
Waiting for you my friend.
Crying for you in fact.
Why didn't you tell her?
- I didn't know myself.
Arrest this man.
Wait!
Pull her up.
Arturo ..
- But she doesn't know!
No.
But you do.
Rota just told you.
But he didn't!
A little higher.
- Ahh!
The Priests were fools until the end.
But you are not a Priest now.
You are a man.
And that's your woman, there.
A little higher still.
- Let her down.
Let her down!
As soon as you've told me where that bloody Relic is.
The exact location.
That was a confession.
You know very well what "confession" means.
I know you Godly people have peculiar ideas but ..
Will you kindly tell me what the hell you are doing there?
In two more minutes, I'll have the Relic, comrade General.
Do you mean the thing that was going to save the city?
I mean that relic that you ordered me to get.
Has she got it?
- No, but ..
Let her down.
Of all the colossal stupidities.
Get her out there with the rest of the prisoners.
Who is this fellow?
- The priest who knows where the relic is.
Take him out there too.
And all the others in the cells down here.
Is this the way you wage war now?
Hanging beautiful women?
But this is a matter of importance comrade General.
Would you like to have a drink with me in my quarters?
What a war.
Is this really what you've been fiddling away with all evening?
If you give me one more minute ..
- For what?
To save a city that is already lost?
Don't you know we couldn't save the city now with five gallons of that blood?
I tell you the truth before God, Captain.
I just hope that my officers scare the enemy as much as they do me.
Now you come with me.
I've got a job for you.
Attention!
Attention!
Silence!
You have had the bad judgment to be born in the wrong country ..
In the wrong year, and on the wrong side.
And so it is with the greatest regret.
That I'm now going to play a very dirty trick on you.
In order to gain time, I'm going to send you south.
To meet your friends who have set out to overthrow their government by force.
But then, these friends will also play a very dirty trick on you.
Having rewritten one of the cardinal rules of warfare.
They do not take prisoners.
They will shoot you.
Such, unhappily .. is the nature of war.
In this new era of dirty tricks.
But the government you have tried to betray.
Have no intention of permitting you to be murdered in cold blood like that.
The minute you are fired upon, you will be given rifles.
You will then have the privilege of deciding for yourselves.
Whether you want to fire back at your friends.
Or just stand there and have your tails shot off.
This will be the final dirty trick.
Long live The Republic.
Good luck Captain.
If you run into the Generalissimo, give him my regards.
We fought together in Africa.
Prisoners, attention!
Have you ever covered a civil war?
It's like trying to make love in revolving door.
Prisoners fall out!
But keep close to the road.
Did he really tell you where it was?
And if the General hadn't come in, I should have told him.
You would have?
I would have had to.
But I would have deserved it, anyway.
- No, no.
How could anybody be so stupid?
It was just too clever for us.
What do you think you can do about it?
- I don't know.
They'll never get it.
- Give me your hands.
Who says so?
- Comrade Captain says so.
Attention!
This way everybody.
Come along!
This man was sentenced to be executed this morning.
For treason.
The sentence will now be carried out.
All prisoners will keep their eyes to the front.
I want you to see what happens to a man who tries to betray his country.
Alright, comrades.
Ready .. aim ..
Fire!
[ pistol shot ]
If only I could get it away from them.
The Generals and the Bishops.
Using it as an instrument of war to make men kill each other.
If I could get it away from this insanity.
Save it from such desecration.
Is this Basalles?
No.
We won't be at Basalles until tomorrow night.
Is that where you're going to broadcast?
- That's what the script says.
God is very patient isn't he.
There is no end to his patience.
Do you think he'll understand me?
I believe so.
It won't be easy.
I don't suppose there are any easy ones for Him.
I've always believed in God, and the Holy Mother.
But I've never been sure about Priests.
Once I saw the Pope in Barcelona, when I was a little girl.
I wasn't sure about him, either.
You mean the Cardinal.
- No.
The Pope.
Everybody said he was the Pope.
He certainly looked like him.
What about this?
You and me?
Do you think he'll understand that?
We leave Him to decide about that.
I'm sure he'll do what is right.
I'm afraid he'll have to do a little better than that.
Will you hear my confession, Father?
I'm not a priest any longer.
Please Father, bless me.
I have sinned.
I am not a Priest.
- Please, Father.
What's the matter?
Have you never seen a priest with a girl in his arms?
[ latin blessing ]
There is my little village.
Where I was going back one day.
Remember?
Inside.
Alright Mac.
- Hi uncle.
Nice trip?
This is Major Garcia, from Madrid.
- Nice to see you.
I am sure Señor Hawthorne understands the necessity.
I'm covering the battle, not the politics.
Am I liable to get my head shot off?
If you insist on broadcasting a battle, you can't do it from too far, can you.
I didn't insist.
I was "insisted" all the way from New York.
How far is our setup from here?
We've got the cable in a field just down this road.
About three kilometers behind the line.
- Well, that sounds cozy enough.
Comrade Hawthorne is reminded that he is to make no reference to how he got here.
Be of good heart, Captain.
All them messages will be observed until I'm well over the border.
Go on.
You miss her very much, don't you.
Miss whom?
- Your wife.
Your fair bride.
Why do you say that?
- I can tell.
And you'll miss her even more tomorrow.
- Don't talk like that.
Not tonight.
She's the one you want to be with tomorrow but you can only have one of us.
You are the only bride I have.
The only thing I have in the world .. or want.
Perhaps.
Perhaps I can help you decide.
Perhaps I can make your choice for you.
- If you please, Señorita.
Oh not again.
- The comrade Captain wants to see you.
Doesn't this shagger ever give up?
How can you be such a fool?
How long do you think it could last?
Priests and children always return home when night falls.
He can't go back.
- Not if he's never been away.
I don't believe that.
Has he had a moment of decision yet?
Then how can he be so sure?
Don't you think you should find out before it's too late?
We're going to move up at 4 o'clock.
After that of course, you'll never know.
Will that be all?
If you say so.
Captain.
Yes, Señorita?
On second thoughts.
Of course.
Those guns you hear now are the rebel guns.
They're big ones.
Such a barrage is usually a prelude to an advance or an attack.
But any serious ground action at this moment seems most unlikely.
Darling.
What happened?
- I wanted to be with you tonight.
You alright?
- Yes.
I am alright.
If only we .. if only we could fly away from here before the morning.
I can.
The same offer?
- Yes.
What did you tell him?
I told him I'd try.
That doesn't mean that I'd tell him.
What does it mean?
I could tell him something else and then ..
And then I'd get it and take it away ..
like you said.
Take it where?
- Wherever you said.
Away from here.
That's what you meant, wasn't it?
Away from war.
You .. you really think you could do it?
I think so.
I could try.
Supposing.
Supposing you were caught.
I ..
I'd just keep on lying to him.
I'd never tell him the truth.
Do you think it would be alright if I took it to my village in the mountains?
It would be safely away from everything.
Do you think it would be safe there?
- I would stay there with it.
No .. no ..
Don't you trust me?
You know better than that.
I don't want you to be caught.
- I won't be.
Have you got a pocket?
- Yes.
Would you be too afraid to have it on you?
No.
I'd be afraid, but not too afraid.
Quiet .. careful, the socialists are just ahead.
Comrade.
I want to see the comrade Captain.
Wait here.
Can you see anything out there?
- No.
I thought I heard something.
- That woman wants to see you again.
Oh.
Thank you, comrade.
Well?
How can I get away?
- The same way you got here.
Straight back up this road to the city.
Where is it?
Still in the Cathedral.
In the same place, in the high altar.
Very good .. we'll go together and get it.
But I want to leave now.
I'm scared!
You'll go back up with us tomorrow after we've delivered the others into the line.
Is there a sentry forward?
- Yes, comrade.
But you told me I could get away from here tonight!
I told you no such thing.
What's his name?
- Vincenté.
Hey, Vincenté.
Fire up some horses.
I want to go!
- Vincenté.
Vincenté!
You in the Church!
Throw your weapons out!
I give you one minute to throw everything you've got out.
We're prisoners, we're unarmed.
We have no weapons.
How many are you?
- About two hundred.
Will you let me come out and explain, alone?
Alright .. come out with your hands up.
This way.
What do you mean "prisoners"?
Whose prisoners?
- Nationalist prisoners.
These are our guards.
We're being taken up to the front to be killed.
What kind of filth is that?
Why couldn't they kill you where you were?
They want to use us as a cover for their retreat.
They'll give us rifles and we've got to dig the trenches.
Where are the rifles?
- In that truck there.
And you say that there are two hundred men in there?
Yes.
Then you've got nearly two companies of men in there.
Yes, but they're not soldiers.
They're unarmed civilians.
Civilians?
Two hundred civilians hiding in a church behind the lines?
They were prisoners.
They were compelled to do what they were told.
Have you any proof of that?
Ask them.
- They're filth.
What good would that do?
How could I tell if they were lying or not?
Listen to me, please.
It's no use.
I can't take a chance like that.
I hate to shoot two hundred men, but I don't know what else to do.
I'm already one hour and a half behind schedule.
Captain.
You don't mean that, do you.
Of course I mean it.
This is a battle and I've got orders to follow.
There's no provision for two hundred prisoners.
And I'm certainly not going to leave that many men loose behind me.
I'd be shot myself if I did a thing like that.
But you can't shoot them!
They're not the enemy.
They're friends of the rebellion and members of the church.
I will leave this to you, Captain.
It's a filthy job.
But I've simply got to get this column moving again.
You'll have to shoot them in batches with a machine-gun I suppose.
Who are these?
That's the guard.
Ask them.
Don't talk nonsense.
What else could they do but lie?
Shoot them first.
- What about confessions?
What confessions?
Confession must be granted to all who ask for it.
Those are the Generalissimo's orders.
- There are two hundred men in there.
We have to confess two hundred men?
- All who wish it.
Very well .. get on with it.
But I'm afraid that means you're going be here for the rest of the night.
Adiós.
- Adiós.
May I make one suggestion, Captain?
- Yes.
Will you let me finish all the confessions first?
As dreadful enough as it is without such gunfire.
Of course.
Captain.
These are all true Catholics.
I myself was on a sacred mission taking a Holy Relic to a place of safety.
What Holy Relic?
The relic of the Cathedral.
The Blood of St John.
Where is it?
I haven't got it.
I sent it away.
- But how?
I thought you said you were all prisoners.
If you'll let me explain to you.
You must think me very simple, Señor.
But it is God's truth, Captain.
- Then show me the Relic.
Since you sent it away, perhaps you can bring it back?
Then it will be not only God's truth .. but also his will.
Father, is there nothing you can do about this?
No.
Even in uniform a Priest's influence is effective only in spiritual matters.
I want you to summon up all the courage that you can.
The decision is that we shall be .. executed.
This is the Chaplain who will hear the confessions of those who wish it.
Will all who wish to confess, raise their hands.
Arturo.
Shoot straight Señors.
Fire!
You've got two hundred more men to kill.
- What are you doing out here?
Two hundred more innocent men to kill!
- Come on, get back in there.
Who are you going to answer to for that?
Your God or your Major?
Two hundred murders!
[ confession.
Latin ]
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.
Go on, please.
It is two weeks since I last confessed.
Since then I have loved a woman.
So long as you loved her in God.
But I am a Priest, Father.
A lot of us are to be killed.
You understand that.
Not all of us.
Some will get away.
Still willing?
May God have mercy on your souls.
Wait.
Arturo.
I lost it.
Is this over?
No .. it is just the beginning.
Do you think He will really understand?
I think so.
About you, too?
I'll ask him too.
I loved you, Arturo.
I loved you, Soledad.
Bless me, Father.

That one's mine, Akio.
Guess I need more practice.
I'll have you shooting by your wedding day.
Thank you.
Right in the heart!
That's right.
You've got to aim for a vital spot.
With an aim that good, you could kill a person.
Of course!
Sometimes I'm afraid I might hit someone.
Everyone is at first.
I guess so.
What are those two doing?
Oh, just girl talk.
Kyoko leaves Akio with Dad and she goes off with Soichi!
You're right.
I don't like someone else hunting what I've got my eye on.
He's like a child!
What do you see in him?
I'm going back and find them.
The sky looks so nice out here in the woods.
A few clouds would be nice, though.
You're a romantic, Kyoko.
Even modern girls fall in love, you know.
That's true.
But it's not so easy these days.
There's always complications.
Do you mean how you feel about me?
No!
I mean how you feel about me.
You're engaged to Akio, aren't you?
I don't care about him.
He's Dad's idea.
I'm happy to hear that!
shall I make you happier?
I'm pregnant...with your baby.
What?
!
really?
I'm serious.
Let's talk to Dad when we get back to Tokyo.
He's real stubborn...
He can't say no to this.
I'm scared of him.
Don't be such a coward!
I can't talk to old people.
You tell him, will you?
I guess I'II have to.
But in return...
Minako!
Did you think I was really going to shoot?
Here.
welcome back.
Soichi...
Turn down a fine young man like Akio Shima... to marry that nobody?
I won't allow it!
I don't care.
We're getting married.
What did you say?
!
I'm not a child.
I'm of legal age.
legal age?
What do we tell Akio?
Just tell him the truth.
I can't do that!
How could I face his father?
!
So your social obligations dictate who I marry?
But you agreed to marry Akio!
You pushed me to.
I hadn't made up my mind.
Akio's a fine man!
I wanted him to take over my company!
You're being deceived!
Mother says Soichi is very nice.
Is she in on this?
You'd take a step-mother's word over a father's?
Dad, it's too late.
I'm carrying his child.
What?
!
His child?
!
You damn fool!
Get rid of it!
No!
That's a sin!
Then leave this house!
No!
My child and I have rights!
silence!
Get out!
I never want to see you again!
No!
I can be stubborn, too.
Then suit yourself!
Kyoko!
Miyata here.
Right.
Uesugi!
A job.
The owner of Imai Industries is dead.
call Forensics.
Thank you.
Mrs. Imai?
My condolences.
It was so sudden...
I don't know what to do...
I sympathize.
I don't understand why he would just go and commit suicide!
Let's not jump to conclusions.
If you could tell me what happened...
I was with Minako, my younger daughter.
I heard my husband cry out from the salon, so I ran in.
When I got there he was dead, with Kyoko holding him.
Are they going to question us?
What a nuisance!
How can you say that?
Daddy's dead!
But I guess a step-daughter wouldn't understand.
It's true.
I'm not a blood relative.
But didn't you say yourself you wished he were dead.
But I didn't really mean it!
If you say so.
Muto!
will they question us, too?
You've got a record!
And your fingerprints will be on the bottle from when you took sips out of his whisky.
I always made sure to be wearing gloves.
When you brought in the fruit, what were Mr. Imai and Kyoko doing?
They seemed to be talking.
Not just chatting, though...
I Ieft the room right away.
Don't try to hide it!
They were fighting, weren't they.
Listen... you can be charged with perjury, you know.
Yes.
They were quarreling.
You've got a record.
Of course you're a suspect!
Me?
kill him?
The only one who'd give work to a man like me... was Mr. Imai.
Why would I?
Then where were you?
In the garage.
And did you hear the two of them fighting?
Come on, give us the truth.
We've talked to the maid.
Yes.
We found this perfume bottle in Kyoko's handbag.
It's potassium cyanide.
Oh, my!
Kyoko wouldn't do that!
Of course, she's not really my daughter, but... she's a good girl!
She'd never do that!
But Mrs Imai the evidence makes it natural to think she did.
Kyoko would never do such a horrible thing!
So you and your mother were in the sitting room.
You're sure of that?
Do you think I'm lying?
Don't you want to help us find who did this?
Why do you think I came here?
OK how had Mr. Imai and Kyoko been getting along lately?
She said she wished he were dead.
Everyone says you and your father were quarreling.
And there's this bottle.
Is it yours?
Yes.
We found cyanide in it.
Do you know anything about that?
No!
The truth!
Her fingerprints were on the whisky glass.
We've got all the evidence we need.
Why not confess?
No!
I would never kill my father!
I'm being framed!
I didn't do it!
It wasn't me!
Patricide Verdict Tomorrow
Tokyo District Court
Not with standing the evidence of fingerprints on the glass potassium cyanide in her perfume bottle and testimony that she quarreled with her father on the day of the crime, she not only denies her guilt but is pregnant by a man
to whom her father was opposed.
As she expresses no hint of penitence, this court finds Imai Kyoko guilty of murder with no grounds for clemency, and sentences her to death.
It's not true!
I didn't do anything!
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
Kyoko!
Soichi!
Imai Gets Death Sentence
Final Appeal Confirms Death Sentence
Morioka
Morioka Prison
Stop brooding, will you?
You can't change what's been done.
Even with a death sentence, it's years before they kill you.
The Prime Minister has to put his seal on it.
And he's a coward, so he'lI never do it.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
Wow!
You've got nice breasts!
Do you have a baby?
He's seven months old.
Then cheer up, for his sake.
This place is what you make it.
And never know...
things could get better.
Understand?
Misbehave again and you'II go back to solitary.
We aren't like women who have men to hold them, you know.
You're disgusting!
Don't get all holy with me!
I'II bet a man can make you squeal.
You never learn, do you.
I'II tell the Warden.
Go right ahead.
The Warden's no different than anyone else.
Don't be so proud.
Look at her scamper!
And stay out!
Hey, a new girl...
Keep your hands off her.
You sound like that guard!
What's your girlfriend going to say?
You see this, Yoshiko?
Make Yoshiko jealous and you never know what she'II do.
Don't make me laugh, Kimie.
Huh, Yoshiko?
Kyoko, you have a visitor.
A visitor?
A woman?
A man?
A man?
It's a man, isn't it!
Quiet down!
It's a man, isn't it!
It must be!
Thank you, Soichi.
Look at what's happened to me...
Try to keep your spirits up.
I'm getting used to it.
Anyway, how's the baby?
still at the children's Home.
Is he all right?
He's fine.
Do you go every day?
I can't.
Did you bring his picture?
No.
I thought it wouId be too painful for you.
No, please!
Send it to me as soon as you get home!
I was waiting for that!
I'II send it.
Don't forget.
And like I wrote you in my letter, I'm innocent!
I know that.
I've got a lawyer looking into it.
We found out that the maid hid something very important.
We went to Ginza the day your father died, remember?
while we were out, Akio was at your house.
And he went into your room!
Akio?
is that true?
Yes.
And that's not all.
He was at the trial every day, and he's here in Morioka now!
There's something about him I don't trust.
No?
He's come here two or three times.
I wouldn't see him, though.
He's at a dormitory his company has here.
I'lI check it out.
Time's up.
Thank you for coming.
Don't forget the picture.
I won't.
- Come again.
- I will.
Your boyfriend?
Well?
What do you care?
Why are you so concerned?
I thought you didn't like lesbians.
Just mind your own business.
Don't be so selfish!
I just want to know!
If you're happy about something, share it!
Don't talk to her!
Shut up!
Don't go jealous on me!
No!
What are you doing?
!
Get off of me!
I mean it!
Keep away from me!
So how did it go?
He's going to try to find out who really did it.
Men always say things like that.
Don't get your hopes up.
I know he'II do it!
Have fun thinking that.
And the picture?
He forgot.
But he said he'II send it.
There's not much hope for a man who'd forget that.
Forget him.
Sometimes people make mistakes!
You're a fool.
Dream on if you want, but you're in for a disappointment.
What are you doing?
!
Go back in line.
No!
I can't take this!
What do you mean?
You're here for a reason!
I didn't do anything!
Why should an innocent woman suffer like this?
!
You had a fair trial.
The police, the court...
Damn them for their lies!
Go, Kyoko!
You tell 'em!
I hate this place!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
It's been three months since he was here.
If he hasn't even got the heart to send your baby's picture will he ever get you out of here?
If you're really innocent... why don't you just get the hell out of here?
well?
Why don't we both make a run for it?
A woman could never make it.
I know that!
But you're innocent!
Maybe two women could.
I've tried it alone before.
Once I almost got a rope ladder over the fence.
It's impossible alone.
I'II come with you.
You will?
I'm in the right!
I'II come.
I've got a ladder made.
I know where to get something to cut metal.
But I'm a habitual criminal.
They watch me too close.
What is it?
A file, for the bars.
Who's got one?
Mari, the model prisoner.
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get in line!
Is that facial hair I see?
Stop this nonsense!
I just thought you should know!
It's terrible, isn't it!
You, too.
Come on.
You're getting a moustache!
Hurry it up!
Do as I say and I'II keep quiet.
Get over there.
Go on!
I'II call the guard!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Stop it!
Let go of me, Yoshiko!
I'II kill you!
Yumiko!
What happened?
!
She got all choked up.
Yumiko!
Wake up!
Yumiko!
Hey!
Doctor!
Hey!
Yumiko!
Move.
What's wrong with you?
You're awake?
Doctor!
You came!
I'm glad!
A man...
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
Yumiko!
Let go!
What are you doing?
!
You mustn't get up!
Keep quiet!
Doctor!
please!
hold me!
Have you gone mad?
!
You're both going to solitary!
Quiet down!
Doctor!
calm down!
What's going on?
Keep quiet!
I'm too scared to move!
pull yourself together!
Come on!
Kyoko!
Are you OK?
Get up!
Kyoko!
Snap out of it!
They'II catch us if we don't hurry!
Head for the church, OK?
Get going!
Hurry!
Shima Confectioneries Morioka Dormitory
Akio Shima
Yes?
But how?
You killed my father!
I did not!
Why would you think that?
It's no use lying!
You came to our house that day, didn't you.
You were in my room, and the salon!
Who said that?
You don't fool me!
I've spent this past year... waiting to break out of jail to either make you confess... or kill you myself!
Kyoko, calm down!
Maybe you think I did it... but I didn't.
Do you think I'd kill your father and pin the blame on you?
For the last year I've thought you couldn't have done it.
That you're innocent.
That's why I came up to Morioka.
I went to the prison, but you wouldn't see me.
If you don't believe that, then stab me right now.
I won't stop you.
Do you believe me?
No, I don't.
But I can't kill someone.
I'II make you believe me.
But you can't stay here.
The police are coming.
A friend of mine... has a place behind his house.
You can hide there.
You know where the other woman went.
talk!
I won't quit till you do.
You can talk, can't you?
Yes?
From Tokyo?
The police Department?
Thanks for calling.
It's the lnspector who handled the case.
Yeah?
Morioka police, Detective Watanabe here.
Imai Kyoko escaped?
AII right.
Imai Kyoko?
The one who killed her father?
So she'lI come back here?
You remember Akao Soichi?
Her boyfriend?
Stake him out.
Ishii!
Watch the place her kid's in.
Kato, her fiance's father owns Shima Confectioneries.
His name's Akio.
Check him out.
Find out who that is.
It's Akao Soichi.
I knew it!
Take over.
I'lI be at the station.
Inspector!
Akio Shima's in Morioka.
We asked them to find him.
He is, huh?
OK, thanks.
So she hasn't been here?
No.
It's a crime to harbor a fugitive, you know.
I know.
well, I warn you if she comes here, you call us.
please.
Kyoko, it's best if I go to Tokyo by myself.
Take me with you!
I can't!
The station's full of cops.
Just wait here.
I'II bring good news.
No!
I'm sick of being shut in!
Don't be stupid!
You don't understand what it's like to be shut in, Iike an animal!
The paper said they'd caught the other woman who escaped because she was in too much of a hurry.
You should wait here.
AII right?
I want to see my baby!
Take me with you!
I can't take waiting here!
well, it's risky...
but let's try it.
His room's empty!
Damn it!
Get some men down to the station!
For Ueno
well?
Have you seen them?
Not yet.
They'II be together.
Keep your eyes open.
Your attention, please.
The 1 4:45 train for Ueno Station, Tokyo, is now boarding.
Please have your tickets ready and form a double line.
They're together.
Hey, you...
What's all this?
Last call for the 1 4:45 train to Ueno Station, Tokyo.
AII passengers please board now.
See them?
No.
They're not here.
There he is!
Excuse me!
Second Class
Excuse me...is that your child?
He's mine.
The toilet's free now.
Thank you very much.
Come to Mommy...
were you a good boy?
Why did you jump onto the train?
I was late.
You're lying!
Then why did you sneak out of your dormitory like that?
I don't like being watched!
Get back in there!
I'm scared!
Quick!
Utsunomiya!
Chief...
Come here.
What?
You made it!
The maid says Akao Soichi and the younger sister are involved.
I see.
Is this connected with Kyoko breaking out of prison?
I've been after one fish, but now some others look bigger.
What other fish?
Watanabe, Morioka police.
I'm Yamaguchi.
Akio Shima's in Tokyo.
Where?
We lost him at Utsunomiya.
Right from under our noses.
Mother doesn't know about us, so don't let anyone see you leave.
Don't get too close to Minako.
Don't scare me like that, Inspector.
You decide if you're scared or not.
You walk so quietly...
I thought Mr. Imai'd come to haunt me.
Does he?
No.
Kayo the maid just likes to talk too much.
Whose car is this?
Mr Miss Minako's.
Then why was Akao driving it?
Why would Mr. Akao stay here?
He asked about Kyoko, then he left.
His car was outside.
The engine was cold.
- Mr. Akao's car?
- So your driver said.
Oh, no, he's mistaken.
Minako lent it to Mr. Akao.
They've become very close.
Might they get married?
Never!
Mr. Akao was Kyoko's lover.
He'II never marry Minako!
I see.
I'm sorry.
So Akao's not here, then?
No.
So Kyoko's in Tokyo, Akao isn't here...
That means they must be together somewhere.
What do you want?
Just to talk to you.
I have nothing to say.
will you calm down and listen?
The police don't frame people.
You put Imai Kyoko in jail when she was innocent.
That may be true.
Anyway, can we go somewhere and talk?
would you mind?
So you really think someone else did it?
I'm not lying.
Prove that.
You'lI have to take my word.
No, thanks.
I see.
well, I'II bet you... my police id.
I don't trust you yet.
I'II keep this.
tell me what's happened.
Kyoko came to Tokyo with me.
From what she says, Akao isn't to be trusted.
You're right.
He's involved with the sister, and maybe with the mother, too.
really?
I'm more sure of it after what you've said.
He has no money, but after Kyoko went to jail he bought a car and drove up there.
OK.
Don't forget this.
I won't arrest you...for now.
Inspector!
Why are you opening a closed case when we're after an escaped prisoner?
I'm after the truth.
We had her convicted!
How will it look if we question our own evidence and abet a fugitive?
!
Uesugi, we're only human.
We have to admit when we're wrong.
The law is there to preserve justice.
Not to save our face.
hello?
You want to speak to Mr. Akao?
Who's calling?
hello?
Just a minute.
Mr. Akao!
Mr. Akao!
telephone!
Hang on.
It's a woman.
hello?
Akao speaking.
Is that you, Soichi?
Your voice sounds funny.
Yes.
So it is you!
I...
hello?
You called his apartment?
He isn't there!
So who was that?
The police!
I know it's hard, but keep your promises, OK?
I told you not to call anyone!
I'm sorry.
I saw a baby from the window and I thought of my son.
I wanted to ask Soichi how he was.
I understand.
Even though you suspect Soichi, you still love him.
I know that.
But don't think about that now.
We have to concentrate on proving you innocent!
Then you can be with your son all you want.
What?
He's dead?
!
Yes.
He'd just had the measles, then he got pneumonia.
It was just a week ago.
Words aren't enough.
If I have this picture, I can put up with anything.
But how was he?
Can he walk yet?
Kyoko, I have some bad news.
A week ago he died of pneumonia.
My baby's dead?
He's dead?
Kyoko...
I've only lived for two things, to prove I'm innocent and to see my baby!
But if he's dead...
I hate even being alive!
You have to be strong!
If you break down now, the criminal will go free!
You have to be brave!
Excuse me...there's a police officer to see you.
hello?
Mr. Shima!
Open the door, please!
You gave us our chance when you went to see the baby.
Inspector, I'm innocent!
That's why I escaped!
He's helping me find the real criminal!
What's wrong with that?
Why must you torment an innocent person?
!
The law's the law.
You're an escaped felon, and you've abetted her.
But I'm innocent!
I won't go back to that awful prison!
I won't watch you do the same thing to Akio!
I didn't kill my father!
Inspector!
I didn't do anything!
I'm innocent!
Let go of me!
Akio!
I'm innocent!
Come on!
Let go of me!
I didn't do anything!
Inspector!
It wasn't me!
I'm innocent!
Sorry for all the trouble.
We'II take the girl back up north with us tomorrow.
What time?
The train leaves Ueno at 1 0:30, so if we leave here at 1 0...
I see...tomorrow at 1 0 a.m....
I'II call off the stake-outs.
No.
Why not?
We've caught her.
Do as I say.
But the regulations say...
I'II take responsibility.
Yes?
What?
Akao and Mrs Imai?
Where?
!
OK.
Pick them up.
And get the daughter, Minako, as well.
We have a warrant.
Excuse me...
police.
Are you Midori Imai?
Yes.
Come with us, please.
Why?
You'lI be told.
Is Mr. Akao here?
Mr. Akao Soichi?
Hold it!
What's the matter?
We haven't done anything wrong.
You got them?
And Minako?
She's in Hakone?
!
Get her here by 1 0 tomorrow.
She's the missing link.
By 1 0 o'clock!
Minako Iwai's left her cottage in Hakone for Tokyo.
She's not back yet.
Detective Ishii's waiting for her.
OK.
Good morning.
We're here for the prisoner.
Fine.
You can have her at 1 0.
Inspector!
would you come with us?
Yes?
Good.
Hurry it up!
Here she is.
Thanks.
Did you get tired of waiting for Mr. Akao?
What's it to you?
He was at a hotel...
with your mother.
Don't be stupid!
We're getting married.
The truth at last!
Your mother's a real piece of work.
She and Akao claim that you killed your step-father.
That's a lie!
It was their idea!
Who poisoned the whisky?
They did.
Why?
For the estate, and because Mother was afraid Kyoko... would steal Soichi.
So that's the truth, is it?
Your daughter's confessed.
What'II happen to me?
I didn't kill anyone!
They poisoned him!
I didn't do anything!
Let's go.
Come on.
Death Row Woman innocent Step-Mother, Sister, Lover Charged
Idiots!
Akio, you remember that time on the train?
You were holding onto me tight, but I still thought I was going to die.
That's all in the past now.
But hang on tight, anyway.
The End
You say you didn't kill those seven men.
They whipped your father with barbed wire and then they shot him like a sick steer.
After that, why didn't you kill them, Jessie May?
Mr. Paladin, I'm thinking that it is time you got married.
As your great Benjamin Franklin once said, that a single man has not nearly...
"October 7, 1876.
"Kill Jessie May.
"During the War of the Rebellion, a terrible hurt
"was done Jessie May Turnbow.
"Not yet ten years old, he saw his father whipped
"then shot for an act of espionage against the Union.
"Seven of the 12 men who tried Turnbow
"have been wantonly murdered by this boy
"in a grotesque act of revenge.
"Yesterday, it was John Reilly Dowler-
"farmer, businessman, churchgoer.
"Who tomorrow?
"But Joseph Ergo, one of the 12,
"refuses to raise his hand against the boy.
"We join with Abraham Sinclair in his hunt for the murderer.
"We say, kill Jessie May."
And it is time, Mr. Paladin, you got married.
Married?
¶ ¶
Hold it, Mister.
That's far enough, now.
It's been a long trip, I'd like to step down and rest.
What do you want here?
I want to talk to Joe Ergo.
All right.
Over there.
Follow me.
Paladin?
That's right.
I'm Ergo.
This is Abe Sinclair.
Sinclair.
Mr. Ergo, you change your mind?
See, even a stranger can smell the hate in you, Abe.
I'm keeping bad company.
Hate.
I'm just near scared to death of that boy.
That's the truth.
It can be killed, Abe.
I can remember him when he was a toddler.
And you killed his father?
We was all there.
Well, how many times have you tried to kill the boy?
I've gone after him six times.
Mr. Ergo, you didn't answer me.
I changed my mind.
I want him dead.
Why?
He killed a girl over at Sandee, about 200 miles from here.
And that ain't all he did he...
That's loose talk, Sim!
Loose talk.
Give the devil his due.
He just shot her.
She was about 17 years old.
An ignorant mountain girl.
She was married to one of the 12.
I guess Purdy wasn't home when the boy came for him, so he shot his wife instead.
He's got some kind of automatic shotgun.
He made it himself.
I went over for a look.
The shanty was blown to pieces.
Well, I was gonna ask how all this got started.
I... don't suppose that matters much anymore.
Not this side of purgatory.
This reminds me of what we did to his father.
Oh, he was always a good boy, I always liked him.
Stay down here.
Jessie May!
Jessie May Turnbow!
This is Joe Ergo!
Let me talk to you!
Oh...
He's reloading!
Automatic shotgun?
¶ ¶
That's a good gun.
A little rough on the outside but it shoots straight.
Yes, sir.
Yours, too.
Have you ate?
I've been eating my own cooking for the last ten days.
Why don't you climb down and rest yourself?
All we have is beefsteak but we got plenty of that.
Ansel?
Mmm, no, thanks.
No more.
Mister?
No.
Jondill, you can cook.
Why, Mister, you can stay here as long as you want.
Ansel, you never sweet talk me like that.
No, sir, but, uh, it ain't 'cause I don't appreciate your effort, Mr. Jondill.
Ansel?
Anybody else pass through here this week besides me?
No.
I lost him at the Matawan River.
That's a bad place.
He killed three men last week.
Seven before that, and a woman.
Ansel.
A kind of saddle tramp over at Territory ford, three, four days ago.
He didn't want to talk.
I didn't bother him.
How old?
Maybe 40.
No one else?
Hmm, no, sir.
I ain't seen no one.
Of course, I... don't get around as much as I used to.
Bronc rider?
Was.
Too many broncs.
How long you been hunting this man?
200 miles, ten days.
What's he look like?
I don't know.
I've never seen him.
Young.
Somebody's coming.
Well, this is where I lost his trail...
Hey!
Hello in there!
I hope there ain't some trigger-happy fool gonna shoot me.
That's one of our own.
Come on in, if you're sober.
Where's your horse?
He broke his leg, you old stove-up fool!
I ain't surprised;
I expected it.
Did you get the supplies?
Sure did.
I didn't lose that pack horse and he's loaded down under the gills.
Whew!
Let's have some light.
How are you?
Paladin, meet Jessie Turnbow.
Jessie May Turnbow?
That's right.
How'd you know?
A bounty hunter, for sure.
Mr. James, you keep your hand away from that gun, you won't get hurt.
But you got the wrong man.
Don't make no matter to him.
To him, Mr. Turnbow's just dead pork, anyway.
Now, you just stand easy.
Paladin... you got the wrong man!
Do I?
He's sure right, Mister.
I don't know what you want.
Your father executed as a traitor in Wyoming, 10, 12 years ago?
That's right.
They whipped him with barbed wire.
And then they shot him in the head like he was a steer with a broke leg.
Mr. Sinclair said, "He don't deserve it, Turnbow,
"but here's your coup de grace."
You know what a coup de grace is, Mister?
It was five years before I found out.
What do you want me to do, son?
Mourn him?
I'll mourn the ten men you murdered.
I'll mourn that woman you shotgunned.
Mister, I didn't do none of those things.
Turn around.
Come on.
You got chains, too?
That's right.
They're in my saddle bag, Mr. James.
Get 'em and put 'em on him.
Go on!
Yeah, but you can't go nowhere.
Everything's all running over.
You can't get up to the mountains and all the rest of the territory around here's flooded.
You gonna take him back for trial, mister?
I mean, really take him back for trial?
I am.
A fair one?
I won't say that.
I can't guarantee it.
I don't believe it!
Now put 'em on him!
We'll stay outside tonight, out in that lean-to, and it'll save temptation.
Come on!
I hate chains on a man.
I hate chains worse than death.
Mister did you find what you was looking for?
No.
Mister...
Oh, here, I brung you these blankets.
Thank you.
He's a good boy, mister.
I knowed him three years.
That boy never treated me with nothing but respect, and I like him.
Mister...
Well, Ansel and me decided, you try to take the boy, and we're gonna kill ya.
Now where's that gun?
He took it away from me inside, remember?
I was wearing it on my hip.
You built it yourself?
That was a Peacemaker, mister.
I mean the shotgun.
You're loony as a coot, mister, I'm tellin' ya.
You want to tell me about your father?
I wasn't but ten years old, and what'd I know?
A good man?
Yes, sir.
My pa was the king of the world.
I never did have no ma.
She died in my bornin'.
But my pa was the king of the world.
He spoon-fed me when I was sick tanned my hide when I was bad.
He read the Bible to me every night.
Taught me how to ride and rope.
And how not to be afraid to fight.
You asked me about my pa, mister, I'll tell ya.
Boy, he was just the king of the whole world.
Was he a traitor?
He was a Southerner.
I wasn't but ten years old.
I guess he did whatever they said he did.
Jessie, it's fine thing to be able to build a gun like that.
I don't know many men that could do it.
Like what?
Like an automatic shotgun that could tear a house to pieces.
You've done that, haven't you, Jessie?
Boy, mister, now I'm tellin' you, you're loony.
Well, Jessie, if those men did to your father what you say they did, then why haven't you killed them?
I don't never want to see nobody killed again.
¶ There's a whole lot of places I'd rather be ¶
¶ Like sitting' under an old oak tree ¶
Boy, you've changed your tune.
¶ Waitin' for a pretty girl to come after me... ¶
Not!
That was close, Mr. James.
That was very close.
Can I talk to you?
Over there, where the boy won't hear.
Hey, Jondill, where the devil's my breakfast?
You gonna let me hang without having something nourishing in my gut?
Mr. Jondill ain't here right now, Jessie.
No, sir, he ain't here right now at all.
Where?
You asked me where Mr. Jondill was, mister.
I'll tell you.
He's over in those trees, with a rifle lined on your belly.
I drop this hat, and he'll kill ya.
You see, he ain't only a cook, he's a good shot with a rifle, too.
You got a firm hold on that hat?
Well, my fingers are getting a mite tired.
So suppose you just shuck that gun out with your left hand.
Well, there must be something good about him to get that strong a hold on two men like you.
Shuck the gun out, mister, or I'll drop the hat.
And so help me, if Mr. Jondill doesn't kill you,
I will.
Now the key.
Ah!
Hey, thanks, you old fool.
You take care of yourself now, you hear?
Yeah.
Your horse is over there behind the tent.
I'll see you again, Ansel.
And Mr. Jondill, too, you tell him, hear?
All right.
Boy!
I will be coming after you.
Yeah.
Go, go, go, go, go.
All right, Jondill, you can come out from behind the tent now.
Well, if you knew, why'd you let him go?
Well, if he's the one, he won't just keep running.
He'll be out there someplace, and with that fancy shotgun of his, I think.
Besides...
I didn't want to kill either one of you.
I guess you could have done it, too.
Maybe I was wrong.
Get down.
Get down!
Git!
¶ ¶
Oh, Lord!
Soon as I heard that whistling I knowed it was him.
He told me his his pa used to... used to sing that tune.
How he loved his pa.

The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.
Morning, Mr. Blair.
Be with you in a minute, Adam.
Ho!
Ho!
Welcome to Virginia City, Reverend.
I thank thee, sir.
Uh... planning on staying?
No, sir.
Just long enough to water our animals.
You're very welcome, Reverend.
Just help yourself.
I thank thee, and may God bless your day.
Yeah.
Our people have had a very long journey.
We've come all the way from Ohio.
Adam.
I'm glad you rode in today.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Come on in.
How's Ben these days?
Adam?
Oh, uh... he's fine.
Here's your bill of lading, Adam.
Tell Ben I want the cattle shipped by the first of the month.
It'll be there.
Good.
Time for a little drink?
No, thanks.
It's a little early for me.
I like my cards from the top.
You been getting them from the top!
That card you were just gonna deal me came from the bottom of the deck, mister.
It's the five of clubs.
Mister, you're just asking for trouble.
Hold it...
Get out of here, the both of you.
And stay out of here.
Mine.
Get him off to the sheriff, you tinhorn gambler.
I'd have beat him anyway.
Why did you step in?
Uh, he was going to shoot you.
Well, I guess that's as good a reason as any.
But now I owe you.
Which way you riding?
West.
Ride a piece with you?
Fine.
Last time I saw one of them sect trains, was just outside Salt Lake City.
Funny thing about them people.
They don't use guns.
I know.
They don't believe in them.
Where's your horse?
Livery.
I didn't get the name.
Cartwright.
Adam Cartwright.
From the Ponderosa, huh?
That's right.
You in the ranching business?
Not yet, but I'm looking for a stake.
I want some land and some cattle that don't belong mostly to a bank.
I don't like owing anybody.
Throw my saddle on the calico.
Well, I rode the edge of the Ponderosa yesterday on my way here.
Mighty big place.
How does a man get a place like that?
He works.
From the shape that horse is in,
I'd say you've been looking for that stake a pretty long time.
I have... but then it takes a lot of looking.
Well, we can always use good help at the Ponderosa.
You offering me a job?
$40 a month.
At the end of the year, you get your pick in ten head of stock-- bonus.
You make this offer to everybody?
No.
Why me?
You look like you can handle it.
You talk right out, don't you?
I try to.
Well, that's a mighty tempting offer.
Well, you think about it.
I'm doing just that, right now.
Oh...
Black hat.
Black coat.
Beard like a billy goat.
We are weary.
We must find a campsite and rest for the night.
Camp right here.
Sure!
You can have a prayer meeting tonight.
We'll get Hoopla Sal and her gals to come and join in.
I know thou art seeking amusement, but please allow us to pass.
How do we know you ain't desperate characters?
My friends, I assure thee, we wish every man good days and a long life and ask... and ask only to pass in peace.
Pass in peace.
He's asking.
Ask them for nothing, Father.
Well, what do you know?
You're kind of pretty to be with this kind of outfit.
How about them clothes.
What do you say, honey, you and me have a drink of whiskey, huh?
Huh?
And maybe I'll, uh, buy you a new dress, huh?
Come on, honey.
Ain't you got any life in you?
Come on, honey.
Let's have a little fun, huh?
You all right, ma'am?
I believe so, yes.
Hold it.
Get him out of here.
We was just funnin'.
Get ready to move.
Hurry!
Please, Matthew, before there's more trouble!
I thank thee very kindly.
Thou art a very brave man.
Is everything all right, sir?
Yes, thanks to thee and thy friend.
I am Jacob Darien.
I'm Adam Cartwright.
This is my daughter Regina.
Oh, uh, this is, um...
Sam Bord.
You're riding west, sir?
Why, uh, y-yes.
So are we.
Uh, maybe it would be a good idea if we rode along with you.
If thou art going that way.
Uh, we are.
Then thou art indeed welcome.
Indeed.
Nice girl, that.
Yeah.
Sam Bord, huh?
Your name is familiar to me.
I figured it might be.
You could have used another name.
Don't see any reason to.
I figure, I owe a man something, the least I can do is be honest with him.
Thanks for the job offer.
It still goes, Sam.
My friends.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Ho!
Ho!
Whoa!
...give Thee thanks for the protection and the guidance
Thou hast given us this day.
And especially we give thanks for our new friends, who have served us so well, and for this earth and this sky and this water.
And we wish Thee, Lord, a peace-filled night as we wish it for ourselves and our fellow men.
Amen.
Amen.
Here, let me help you.
No.
Thou art a guest.
And thou art...
a most pretty young woman.
Thou art a strange man, Adam Cartwright.
Strange?
Why do you say that?
Thou had much to say to me every time thou looked at me today, and yet, now that the opportunity is here, thou sayest nothing at all.
Well, maybe, uh... maybe I just don't know what to say or how to say it.
Simple and direct, as is everything under God's sky.
What puzzles thee?
Um... your father, uh, them and... your customs.
All disturb thee, Adam?
Yes, uh... well, no.
I mean, um...
Well, if, uh, for instance, if it were my train,
I'd-I'd circle the wagons at night instead of, uh, stringing them out.
Oh.
And I'd pen the stock inside, in case of trouble.
What trouble?
Well, any trouble.
Uh...
Look, uh...
Yes?
Well, I think and, um, do things one way, and...
And-And we do them differently.
Is that it?
Yes.
Well, isn't every man entitled to his... his own beliefs, or his own manner of living?
Yes, but, um...
But what, Adam?
It's you.
You disturb me very much, Regina.
Oh?
Why?
Because I'd like to know more about you.
Because, um...
Well, we're, uh... right back where we started, aren't we?
Oh, no.
We've come a long way from there.
I'm disturbed by thee also, Adam.
Children!
Children...
Go help thy mother.
Susan, go along with thy brother.
Where is thy friend Adam?
Uh, he's with your daughter, helping her to get some water.
My daughter allowed a guest to help?
Uh, Reverend,
I kind of got the idea he wanted to be with her.
And, uh, I kind of got the idea that, uh, perhaps she wishes to be with him.
No objections?
A man might as well object to the wind and the sun and the rain.
What do you carry in here, Reverend?
Hymn books?
No, my friend, not exactly.
Jacob?
Jacob, we have visitors coming.
Welcome.
Welcome, friends, to our humble campsite.
Welcome.
Peace be with you, my friends.
And with you.
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Call me Jacob.
And this is my friend Matthew.
Hey, that fella's sure got a face full of hay, ain't he?
I'm Ben Cartwright, and you're on Ponderosa land.
Ah!
Then these men are...
are thy sons?
Oh, we are indebted to thee.
All of thee.
Oh, is that so?
Indeed, sir.
Why, we have all this fine grazing for our stock, plenty of water to take care of them.
What more could a man ask?
Well, a man could ask how long you're planning to stay here.
We leave on the morrow.
Oh.
Oh, is something amiss?
No.
No, no.
You're, uh, most welcome.
If there's anything that my sons and I can do to serve you, please, uh... please ask us.
Oh, thou art most kindly.
May God bless thee often.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, there is one thing more we would ask of thee.
Oh?
That, uh, thou remain and dine with us.
Oh, well, I, uh...
Yes, sir.
Sure do thank you.
Hi, Pa.
Well...
Uh, these people are...
I know.
Adam, thy father has just bid us welcome on the Ponderosa.
Well, I'm glad of that.
Oh, this is, uh, Regina Darien.
My father.
Ma'am.
Now this is Sam Bord.
Ah, Mr. Bord.
These are my sons-- Hoss and Little Joe.
Howdy.
Mr. Bord, don't we know each other?
We do now.
Howdy.
That chow smells mighty good.
Then thee will remain, Mr. Cartwright?
We insist.
Well, then, we will remain.
Splendid!
Come, friends!
Come on, Joe.
Hoss, what would you say to a man who wore a gun that easy?
Nothing.
Leastways nothing I couldn't back up.
Miss Regina, give me a little more of that.
Certainly.
You folks been eating this kind of food all the way from Ohio?
We have, sir.
Yeah, well, you keep shoveling it out to him, you're not gonna have any left.
Where are you headed?
We hope to be in Slatersville by week's end.
We have word of a large, fertile valley there, and God willing, we hope to buy land and settle in peace.
Hmm.
Buying land-- that could be pretty expensive.
Yes, but we worked for many years and put all of our money together to do it.
It is our dream to start a fresh new life, free of debt.
All of your money?
All of it.
You traveled 2,000 miles across the United States, to settle in a land that you've never seen.
Oh, I've been there.
We've-We've all been there many times in our, in our minds.
My daughter speaks truly.
Before all this, the Ponderosa belonged to thee, was it not a dream in thy mind, also, Mr. Cartwright?
Yes, of course.
Very much a dream.
How was the prayer meeting?
What do you want?
You'll never make a preacher, Sam.
You know what I want.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to let us meet your hymn singers?
Take them and get out of here.
Who do you think you're fooling, Sam?
Not them, not me.
We want our cut of that five.
It's gone.
I lost it.
Mm-hmm.
Well, we figured you'd do that, Sam.
But we figured you'd like a chance to make it up, instead a getting killed.
You can make it up, can't you, Sam?
There's a meadow about a half a mile from here.
I'll meet you there in the morning.
You've got an hour, Sam.
Thou art a strange woman, Regina Darien.
What is it?
Coyote bother you?
Thee treat me well, Adam.
What do you mean?
Thee would think me faithless and hate me if I spoke of it.
You could never be faithless.
I know that much about you.
And I could never hate you.
I know that much about myself.
Oh, Adam, I do have faith, but I...
But what?
Well, we will pass on from here tomorrow, and thee will think of me as that one with the strange people.
And thee will forget me.
I could never forget you.
Oh, Adam, I'm supposed to believe that what will be, will be.
Well, that was before we met?
Yes.
You'll be gone tomorrow and nothing will be.
Oh, Regina.
I'm coming with you.
To Slatersville.
I'll ride along with the train.
It'll give us more time together.
Oh, Adam, yes, we have need of that.
Oh, Adam, you must think me foolish and forward and...
No.
I think of you as... beautiful, lovely.
Adam?
Thee thinks we've been observed, Adam?
And what if we have?
Oh, Adam.
Where you going, Sam?
Tell the folks good-bye for me.
Kind of sudden, isn't it?
Well, I'm kind of like that.
I don't figure you.
I get an itch every time I hear folks talking about what they got and what they're gonna get.
What are you running away from?
Maybe a fella named Sam.
About the job--
I never was much at ranch-handing.
Cards are more my line.
You can take the job... and get everything you always wanted.
You're all right, Cartwright... but it wouldn't do for me to listen to you too long.
- Adam?
- Yeah?
You, uh, you sure you know what you're doing now.
I mean, going with the train and all.
I know what I'm doing.
We're different from them, Adam.
She's different from you.
I'm saying this badly, son, but I... it's what I want to say.
I heard you.
Good luck.
I better go say good-bye to Jacob and the rest.
Hey, Adam.
Now, where are you going?
Oh, about the same place you are, I reckon.
Yeah?
Yep.
Your idea or Pa's?
Well, I...
I reckon it's mine.
I sort of got to likin' this Ohio cooking'.
As a matter of fact, I...
I like everything about these folks.
I didn't think I could even talk to 'em at first, but... then I don't reckon they're so much different from the rest of us-- none of 'em.
When?
When I say.
Well, if it's the kind of outfit you say it is, and if it's as easy as you say it is, why not right now, in the daylight?
Or maybe you need the night.
Ho!
Ho!
Adam, what are you stopping for?
Well, this would be a good place to camp for tonight.
There's still...
two hours of daylight left.
I know, Mr. Darien, but the, um, the animals are all worn out.
Poor beasts.
So are all of us.
We've traveled a long way.
But our fear has been that the land will be taken before we get there.
Forgive us, Adam, if we seem impatient, but we're so anxious to reach our new home.
Well, what about it, Hoss?
You, uh... think that old trail across the plateau might still be good?
Well, I don't know, Adam.
It ain't been traveled in a long time.
Don't know if we can get them wagons across there or not.
Well, don't you think it's still worth a look-see?
Yeah.
Um... water your animals, but, uh, leave 'em hitched up.
We'll see if we can't get you a little further along.
Thank you, Adam.
Hey, wait a minute.
These are fresh tracks, Adam, not over an hour old.
How many do you figure?
Well, looks like at least four.
Well, whoever they are, they could see the wagons all day.
I never knew a man yet didn't come into a wagon train to get some good home-cookin'.
Yeah.
Me, neither.
Unless they had a reason for not wanting to be seen.
Well, those wagons and the stock alone on that train good pickings.
Yeah, and if they're planning to do anything about it, it'll probably be tonight.
Father.
Is something amiss?
Uh, something I have to tell you.
What is it, my friend?
If you people have any guns on this train that you use for hunting or anything else, get them out.
What I'm trying to say is that... we found the tracks of four horses up there.
Now, we have reason to believe that these four men have been watching and following this train all day long.
Well, do you want them to come in and take everything you own without fighting for it?
Surely you must have some guns of some kind.
We have no guns, Adam.
And we can do no violence on our fellow man.
Well, they can do violence on their fellow man, and they will.
Still, it would not be right for us.
Matthew.
Can't you do something?
He's only thinking of us, Father.
Regina!
Hast thou forgotten what we all live by?
We shall pray that this test comes not to us and that once more we shall be delivered.
Mr. Darien, don't you reckon you could pray just as well if the wagons were circled up and they thought you was gonna put up a fight?
I can't see how that'd violate nothing.
Whatever thee thinks best, Mr. Cartwright.
Yes, sir.
Adam thee would use this on a man?
If I have to.
I will stay beside thee, Adam.
If thou canst believe with us, then I will try to believe with thee.
That's them.
We may not have to use 'em.
They see the wagons circled, it might make 'em skittish.
They don't seem very skittish to me.
Seems like they got lots of confidence.
Yo, wagon!
Adam, it is thy friend.
He's made some friends.
Train, ho!
Easy pickings, huh?
The easiest.
Yeah, they was just gonna invite you right in soon as you got here.
You won't need that.
That's what you told me, Sam.
But you told me a lot of things.
Now I'm gonna tell you something.
I want to pick that up, easy or any way I can get it.
And I want to pick it up now.
Wait here.
It's too quiet.
Let's wake 'em up.
Hyah!
Come on, get!
Bord.
Mr. Bord.
My friend.
I pray thee not to do this, my friend.
Get out of my...
Regina!
Hoss, get down!
Earth to earth... ashes to ashes... dust to dust... in sure and certain hope of resurrection into eternal life.
Amen.
We will move on at once, my friends.
Prepare.
Adam...
Thee will leave me, too, Adam?
I have to.
I brought Sam Bord among you, and he did all this to you.
His sins are not thine.
In a way, they are.
It's my job to get that money back.
I better go with him.
Well, they'd probably head south.
Bord needs a new town.
Yep.
Man like that's always needing a new town, I reckon.
That's real pretty, isn't it?
Yeah, really looks good, and I'm gonna enjoy it.
All of it.
Why, we're partners, Shen.
Are we?
Now, I don't figure it that way, Sam.
As I remember it, you owed me and the boys, and since they ain't here to collect,
I just figured I'd take all our shares.
Don't you trust me?
No, I don't, Sam.
Now, you just throw the money over here.
Right down there.
Uh-huh.
Oh, and I'll, uh, I'll have your gun.
Real easy, butt first.
Right down there, too.
You could have had half.
You never did have any brains.
Could be a trap.
Well, it figures.
Yeah, Bord's gone all the way now, Adam-- he's a killer.
Yeah.
Well, ain't but one of 'em left now.
And that's where the money is.
Where's the man belongs to that horse?
I don't know, he left him here, he took another, and give me a $20 gold piece not more than two hours ago.
Which way did he go?
Uh, west, toward Towbridge Creek.
We'd like some fresh horses.
- Well, now, may...
- In a hurry, huh?
Well, he's left the trail again.
Adam, he ain't doing a bloomin' thing but leading us on one big merry chase around and round a circle in these blooming' rocks.
Yeah, well, sooner or later, he's got to go to water.
We're even.
I don't owe you now.
Well, he'll have to find a town now.
Yeah.
Which one's nearest?
Slatersville.
Hey, ain't that where...?
That's right.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
What can I do for you?
This fit any animal you got in here today?
Mare near rode to death.
Goin' to get him another horse tonight.
You got any idea where the man is?
I wouldn't be surprised he's over to the saloon there cooling his dampers.
Pretty hot out today.
Thanks.
Miss Regina.
Miss Regina.
Hoss!
Oh, Hoss, where is he?
Where's Adam?
Is he...?
He's all right, ma'am.
Thank God.
But where?
Ma'am, Bord's in town here, and Adam's gone after him.
Oh, no.
Ma'am, I know how you feel,
I know how Adam feels.
There ain't nothing nobody can do to stop him.
The only thing we can do is try to help him!
Whoa!
Hoss, I've got to find him.
Adam!
Adam, I beg thee, thou must not do this thing.
What about your father, these people?
For whatever the reason, it would be violence.
Adam, I see vengeance in thine eyes!
I saw it when thee rode off!
I've to get that money back.
If thee get it this way with a gun, then it is not worth having!
Thee will find him, and he will be killed or thee will be killed.
I'm sorry.
Adam, if thee do this thing, it will be between us all our lives.
It has to be done, Regina.
You'll get over it.
Will I?
Look at me, Adam.
I am no child.
I've waited a long time to find the kind of a man I could love.
Listen to her, Adam.
You know I don't have any choice.
I'm responsible for Sam Bord!
Thee are not responsible to him.
Thee are responsible to nobody but thyself.
Adam, I beg thee, put away thy gun!
Adam, no, no!
But we befriended thee!
Get out of the way, old man.
I've run all I'm gonna run.
- Hoss, get her out of here!
- Adam!
No, no!
Take this back.
I'm all right.
I had to do it.
Thee are well enough to ride now?
Yes.
Thee will come and visit us?
No, I, I couldn't do that, knowing what it would do to you... and them.
And to thee, Adam?
And me, yes.
He was my father, Adam.
Their leader.
I would be breaking faith with him, and them... and myself, if I...
Neither one of us had a choice, did we?
Bless thee, Adam.
Giddyap!
Hep.
Hyah!
Hup!
Home, Adam?
Home.
This has been a color presentation of the NBC Television Network.
ANNOUNCER:
The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.
(fanfare playing)
Morning, Mr. Blair.
Be with you in a minute, Adam.
(dog barking)
(wagon driver whistling)
DRIVER:
Ho!
Ho!
Welcome to Virginia City, Reverend.
I thank thee, sir.
Uh... planning on staying?
No, sir.
Just long enough to water our animals.
You're very welcome, Reverend.
Just help yourself.
I thank thee, and may God bless your day.
MAN:
Yeah.
Our people have had a very long journey.
We've come all the way from Ohio.
Adam.
I'm glad you rode in today.
DRIVER (in distance):
Hyah!
Hyah!
Come on in.
How's Ben these days?
Adam?
Oh, uh... he's fine.
Here's your bill of lading, Adam.
Tell Ben I want the cattle shipped by the first of the month.
It'll be there.
Good.
Time for a little drink?
No, thanks.
It's a little early for me.
I like my cards from the top.
You been getting them from the top!
That card you were just gonna deal me came from the bottom of the deck, mister.
It's the five of clubs.
Mister, you're just asking for trouble.
Hold it...
Get out of here, the both of you.
And stay out of here.
Mine.
Get him off to the sheriff, you tinhorn gambler.
I'd have beat him anyway.
Why did you step in?
Uh, he was going to shoot you.
Well, I guess that's as good a reason as any.
But now I owe you.
(theme song playing)
Which way you riding?
West.
Ride a piece with you?
Fine.
Last time I saw one of them sect trains, was just outside Salt Lake City.
Funny thing about them people.
They don't use guns.
I know.
They don't believe in them.
Where's your horse?
Livery.
(goats bleating in distance)
I didn't get the name.
Cartwright.
Adam Cartwright.
From the Ponderosa, huh?
That's right.
You in the ranching business?
Not yet, but I'm looking for a stake.
I want some land and some cattle that don't belong mostly to a bank.
I don't like owing anybody.
Throw my saddle on the calico.
(horse sputters)
Well, I rode the edge of the Ponderosa yesterday on my way here.
Mighty big place.
How does a man get a place like that?
He works.
From the shape that horse is in,
I'd say you've been looking for that stake a pretty long time.
I have... but then it takes a lot of looking.
Well, we can always use good help at the Ponderosa.
You offering me a job?
$40 a month.
At the end of the year, you get your pick in ten head of stock-- bonus.
You make this offer to everybody?
No.
Why me?
You look like you can handle it.
You talk right out, don't you?
I try to.
Well, that's a mighty tempting offer.
Well, you think about it.
I'm doing just that, right now.
(laughs)
Oh...
Black hat.
Black coat.
Beard like a billy goat.
(laughter)
We are weary.
We must find a campsite and rest for the night.
Camp right here.
Sure!
You can have a prayer meeting tonight.
We'll get Hoopla Sal and her gals to come and join in.
(laughs)
I know thou art seeking amusement, but please allow us to pass.
How do we know you ain't desperate characters?
My friends, I assure thee, we wish every man good days and a long life and ask... and ask only to pass in peace.
Pass in peace.
(laughing)
He's asking.
Ask them for nothing, Father.
Well, what do you know?
You're kind of pretty to be with this kind of outfit.
How about them clothes.
What do you say, honey, you and me have a drink of whiskey, huh?
Huh?
And maybe I'll, uh, buy you a new dress, huh?
(laughs)
Come on, honey.
Ain't you got any life in you?
Come on, honey.
Let's have a little fun, huh?
(grunts)
(onlookers murmuring)
You all right, ma'am?
I believe so, yes.
BORD:
Hold it.
Get him out of here.
We was just funnin'.
Get ready to move.
Hurry!
Please, Matthew, before there's more trouble!
I thank thee very kindly.
Thou art a very brave man.
Is everything all right, sir?
Yes, thanks to thee and thy friend.
I am Jacob Darien.
I'm Adam Cartwright.
This is my daughter Regina.
Oh, uh, this is, um...
Sam Bord.
You're riding west, sir?
Why, uh, y-yes.
So are we.
Uh, maybe it would be a good idea if we rode along with you.
If thou art going that way.
Uh, we are.
Then thou art indeed welcome.
Indeed.
Nice girl, that.
Yeah.
Sam Bord, huh?
Your name is familiar to me.
I figured it might be.
You could have used another name.
Don't see any reason to.
I figure, I owe a man something, the least I can do is be honest with him.
Thanks for the job offer.
It still goes, Sam.
JACOB:
My friends.
DRIVER:
Hyah!
Hyah!
DRIVER:
Hyah!
Hyah!
(driver whistles)
DRIVER:
Ho!
Ho!
Whoa!
(fading in):
...give Thee thanks for the protection and the guidance
Thou hast given us this day.
And especially we give thanks for our new friends, who have served us so well, and for this earth and this sky and this water.
And we wish Thee, Lord, a peace-filled night as we wish it for ourselves and our fellow men.
Amen.
GROUP:
Amen.
(dog barking)
(child shouts, laughs)
Here, let me help you.
No.
Thou art a guest.
And thou art...
a most pretty young woman.
Thou art a strange man, Adam Cartwright.
Strange?
Why do you say that?
Thou had much to say to me every time thou looked at me today, and yet, now that the opportunity is here, thou sayest nothing at all.
Well, maybe, uh... maybe I just don't know what to say or how to say it.
Simple and direct, as is everything under God's sky.
What puzzles thee?
Um... your father, uh, them and... your customs.
All disturb thee, Adam?
Yes, uh... well, no.
I mean, um...
Well, if, uh, for instance, if it were my train,
I'd-I'd circle the wagons at night instead of, uh, stringing them out.
REGINA:
Oh.
And I'd pen the stock inside, in case of trouble.
What trouble?
Well, any trouble.
Uh...
Look, uh... (Adam sighs)
Yes?
Well, I think and, um, do things one way, and...
And-And we do them differently.
Is that it?
Yes.
Well, isn't every man entitled to his... his own beliefs, or his own manner of living?
Yes, but, um...
But what, Adam?
It's you.
You disturb me very much, Regina.
Oh?
Why?
Because I'd like to know more about you.
Because, um... (sighs)
(laughs)
Well, we're, uh... right back where we started, aren't we?
Oh, no.
We've come a long way from there.
I'm disturbed by thee also, Adam.
(dog barking)
Children!
Children...
Go help thy mother.
Susan, go along with thy brother.
(goats bleating)
Where is thy friend Adam?
Uh, he's with your daughter, helping her to get some water.
My daughter allowed a guest to help?
Uh, Reverend,
I kind of got the idea he wanted to be with her.
And, uh, I kind of got the idea that, uh, perhaps she wishes to be with him.
No objections?
A man might as well object to the wind and the sun and the rain.
(horse neighing, dog barking, children shouting)
What do you carry in here, Reverend?
Hymn books?
No, my friend, not exactly.
MAN:
Jacob?
Jacob, we have visitors coming.
Welcome.
Welcome, friends, to our humble campsite.
Welcome.
Peace be with you, my friends.
And with you.
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Call me Jacob.
And this is my friend Matthew.
Hey, that fella's sure got a face full of hay, ain't he?
I'm Ben Cartwright, and you're on Ponderosa land.
Ah!
Then these men are...
are thy sons?
Oh, we are indebted to thee.
All of thee.
Oh, is that so?
Indeed, sir.
Why, we have all this fine grazing for our stock, plenty of water to take care of them.
What more could a man ask?
Well, a man could ask how long you're planning to stay here.
We leave on the morrow.
Oh.
Oh, is something amiss?
No.
No, no.
You're, uh, most welcome.
If there's anything that my sons and I can do to serve you, please, uh... please ask us.
Oh, thou art most kindly.
May God bless thee often.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, there is one thing more we would ask of thee.
Oh?
That, uh, thou remain and dine with us.
Oh, well, I, uh...
Yes, sir.
Sure do thank you.
Hi, Pa.
BEN:
Well...
Uh, these people are...
BEN:
I know.
Adam, thy father has just bid us welcome on the Ponderosa.
Well, I'm glad of that.
Oh, this is, uh, Regina Darien.
My father.
Ma'am.
(children shouting)
Now this is Sam Bord.
Ah, Mr. Bord.
These are my sons-- Hoss and Little Joe.
Howdy.
Mr. Bord, don't we know each other?
We do now.
Howdy.
That chow smells mighty good.
Then thee will remain, Mr. Cartwright?
MATTHEW:
We insist.
Well, then, we will remain.
Splendid!
Come, friends!
Come on, Joe.
Hoss, what would you say to a man who wore a gun that easy?
Nothing.
Leastways nothing I couldn't back up.
Miss Regina, give me a little more of that.
Certainly.
You folks been eating this kind of food all the way from Ohio?
We have, sir.
Yeah, well, you keep shoveling it out to him, you're not gonna have any left.
Where are you headed?
We hope to be in Slatersville by week's end.
We have word of a large, fertile valley there, and God willing, we hope to buy land and settle in peace.
Hmm.
BEN:
Buying land-- that could be pretty expensive.
Yes, but we worked for many years and put all of our money together to do it.
It is our dream to start a fresh new life, free of debt.
All of your money?
All of it.
BEN:
You traveled 2,000 miles across the United States, to settle in a land that you've never seen.
Oh, I've been there.
We've-We've all been there many times in our, in our minds.
My daughter speaks truly.
Before all this, the Ponderosa belonged to thee, was it not a dream in thy mind, also, Mr. Cartwright?
Yes, of course.
Very much a dream.
How was the prayer meeting?
What do you want?
(snickers)
You'll never make a preacher, Sam.
You know what I want.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to let us meet your hymn singers?
Take them and get out of here.
Who do you think you're fooling, Sam?
Not them, not me.
We want our cut of that five.
It's gone.
I lost it.
Mm-hmm.
Well, we figured you'd do that, Sam.
But we figured you'd like a chance to make it up, instead a getting killed.
You can make it up, can't you, Sam?
There's a meadow about a half a mile from here.
I'll meet you there in the morning.
You've got an hour, Sam.
Thou art a strange woman, Regina Darien.
(coyote yipping and howling)
What is it?
Coyote bother you?
Thee treat me well, Adam.
What do you mean?
Thee would think me faithless and hate me if I spoke of it.
You could never be faithless.
I know that much about you.
And I could never hate you.
I know that much about myself.
Oh, Adam, I do have faith, but I...
But what?
Well, we will pass on from here tomorrow, and thee will think of me as that one with the strange people.
And thee will forget me.
I could never forget you.
Oh, Adam, I'm supposed to believe that what will be, will be.
Well, that was before we met?
Yes.
You'll be gone tomorrow and nothing will be.
Oh, Regina.
I'm coming with you.
To Slatersville.
I'll ride along with the train.
It'll give us more time together.
Oh, Adam, yes, we have need of that.
Oh, Adam, you must think me foolish and forward and...
No.
I think of you as... beautiful, lovely.
BORD:
Adam?
Thee thinks we've been observed, Adam?
And what if we have?
Oh, Adam.
Where you going, Sam?
Tell the folks good-bye for me.
Kind of sudden, isn't it?
Well, I'm kind of like that.
I don't figure you.
I get an itch every time I hear folks talking about what they got and what they're gonna get.
What are you running away from?
Maybe a fella named Sam.
About the job--
I never was much at ranch-handing.
Cards are more my line.
You can take the job... and get everything you always wanted.
You're all right, Cartwright... but it wouldn't do for me to listen to you too long.
(birds chirping)
(indistinct conversation)
- Adam?
- Yeah?
You, uh, you sure you know what you're doing now.
I mean, going with the train and all.
I know what I'm doing.
We're different from them, Adam.
She's different from you.
I'm saying this badly, son, but I... it's what I want to say.
I heard you.
(sighs) Good luck.
I better go say good-bye to Jacob and the rest.
Hey, Adam.
Now, where are you going?
Oh, about the same place you are, I reckon.
Yeah?
Yep.
Your idea or Pa's?
Well, I...
I reckon it's mine.
I sort of got to likin' this Ohio cooking'.
As a matter of fact, I...
I like everything about these folks.
I didn't think I could even talk to 'em at first, but... then I don't reckon they're so much different from the rest of us-- none of 'em.
- ♪♪ - (no audio)
When?
When I say.
Well, if it's the kind of outfit you say it is, and if it's as easy as you say it is, why not right now, in the daylight?
Or maybe you need the night.
DRIVER:
(whistles) Ho!
Ho!
Adam, what are you stopping for?
Well, this would be a good place to camp for tonight.
There's still...
two hours of daylight left.
I know, Mr. Darien, but the, um, the animals are all worn out.
Poor beasts.
So are all of us.
We've traveled a long way.
But our fear has been that the land will be taken before we get there.
Forgive us, Adam, if we seem impatient, but we're so anxious to reach our new home.
Well, what about it, Hoss?
You, uh... think that old trail across the plateau might still be good?
Well, I don't know, Adam.
It ain't been traveled in a long time.
Don't know if we can get them wagons across there or not.
Well, don't you think it's still worth a look-see?
Yeah.
Um... water your animals, but, uh, leave 'em hitched up.
We'll see if we can't get you a little further along.
Thank you, Adam.
Hey, wait a minute.
These are fresh tracks, Adam, not over an hour old.
How many do you figure?
Well, looks like at least four.
Well, whoever they are, they could see the wagons all day.
I never knew a man yet didn't come into a wagon train to get some good home-cookin'.
Yeah.
Me, neither.
Unless they had a reason for not wanting to be seen.
Well, those wagons and the stock alone on that train good pickings.
Yeah, and if they're planning to do anything about it, it'll probably be tonight.
Father.
(group murmuring)
Is something amiss?
Uh, something I have to tell you.
What is it, my friend?
If you people have any guns on this train that you use for hunting or anything else, get them out.
What I'm trying to say is that... we found the tracks of four horses up there.
Now, we have reason to believe that these four men have been watching and following this train all day long.
Well, do you want them to come in and take everything you own without fighting for it?
Surely you must have some guns of some kind.
We have no guns, Adam.
And we can do no violence on our fellow man.
Well, they can do violence on their fellow man, and they will.
Still, it would not be right for us.
Matthew.
Can't you do something?
He's only thinking of us, Father.
Regina!
Hast thou forgotten what we all live by?
We shall pray that this test comes not to us and that once more we shall be delivered.
Mr. Darien, don't you reckon you could pray just as well if the wagons were circled up and they thought you was gonna put up a fight?
I can't see how that'd violate nothing.
Whatever thee thinks best, Mr. Cartwright.
Yes, sir.
Adam thee would use this on a man?
If I have to.
(urgent indistinct conversation)
(cows mooing, goats bleating)
I will stay beside thee, Adam.
If thou canst believe with us, then I will try to believe with thee.
(coyote yipping, howling)
That's them.
We may not have to use 'em.
They see the wagons circled, it might make 'em skittish.
They don't seem very skittish to me.
Seems like they got lots of confidence.
(coyote yipping, howling)
Yo, wagon!
Adam, it is thy friend.
He's made some friends.
Train, ho!
Easy pickings, huh?
The easiest.
Yeah, they was just gonna invite you right in soon as you got here.
You won't need that.
That's what you told me, Sam.
But you told me a lot of things.
Now I'm gonna tell you something.
I want to pick that up, easy or any way I can get it.
(cocks gun)
And I want to pick it up now.
Wait here.
It's too quiet.
Let's wake 'em up.
(gunfire)
(glass shatters)
Hyah!
Come on, get!
(baby crying in distance)
Bord.
Mr. Bord.
My friend.
I pray thee not to do this, my friend.
Get out of my... (gunshot)
(baby continues crying)
Regina!
Hoss, get down!
(grunts)
(gunfire)
(baby continues crying)
(Regina crying)
Earth to earth... ashes to ashes... dust to dust... in sure and certain hope of resurrection into eternal life.
Amen.
We will move on at once, my friends.
Prepare.
HOSS:
Adam...
Thee will leave me, too, Adam?
I have to.
I brought Sam Bord among you, and he did all this to you.
His sins are not thine.
In a way, they are.
It's my job to get that money back.
I better go with him.
Well, they'd probably head south.
Bord needs a new town.
Yep.
Man like that's always needing a new town, I reckon.
That's real pretty, isn't it?
(coyotes yipping, howling)
Yeah, really looks good, and I'm gonna enjoy it.
All of it.
Why, we're partners, Shen.
Are we?
Now, I don't figure it that way, Sam.
As I remember it, you owed me and the boys, and since they ain't here to collect,
I just figured I'd take all our shares.
Don't you trust me?
No, I don't, Sam.
Now, you just throw the money over here.
Right down there.
Uh-huh.
Oh, and I'll, uh, I'll have your gun.
Real easy, butt first.
Right down there, too.
(coyotes yipping, howling)
You could have had half.
You never did have any brains.
Could be a trap.
Well, it figures.
Yeah, Bord's gone all the way now, Adam-- he's a killer.
Yeah.
Well, ain't but one of 'em left now.
And that's where the money is.
♪♪
Where's the man belongs to that horse?
I don't know, he left him here, he took another, and give me a $20 gold piece not more than two hours ago.
Which way did he go?
Uh, west, toward Towbridge Creek.
We'd like some fresh horses.
- Well, now, may...
- In a hurry, huh?
(gun clicks)
Well, he's left the trail again.
Adam, he ain't doing a bloomin' thing but leading us on one big merry chase around and round a circle in these blooming' rocks.
Yeah, well, sooner or later, he's got to go to water.
(gun clicks)
We're even.
I don't owe you now.
Well, he'll have to find a town now.
Yeah.
Which one's nearest?
Slatersville.
Hey, ain't that where...?
That's right.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
What can I do for you?
This fit any animal you got in here today?
Mare near rode to death.
Goin' to get him another horse tonight.
You got any idea where the man is?
I wouldn't be surprised he's over to the saloon there cooling his dampers.
Pretty hot out today.
Thanks.
(sighs)
(wagons rattling)
Miss Regina.
Miss Regina.
Hoss!
Oh, Hoss, where is he?
Where's Adam?
Is he...?
He's all right, ma'am.
Thank God.
But where?
Ma'am, Bord's in town here, and Adam's gone after him.
Oh, no.
Ma'am, I know how you feel,
I know how Adam feels.
There ain't nothing nobody can do to stop him.
The only thing we can do is try to help him!
WAGON DRIVER:
Whoa!
Hoss, I've got to find him.
(door shuts)
Adam!
Adam, I beg thee, thou must not do this thing.
What about your father, these people?
For whatever the reason, it would be violence.
Adam, I see vengeance in thine eyes!
I saw it when thee rode off!
I've to get that money back.
If thee get it this way with a gun, then it is not worth having!
Thee will find him, and he will be killed or thee will be killed.
I'm sorry.
Adam, if thee do this thing, it will be between us all our lives.
It has to be done, Regina.
You'll get over it.
Will I?
Look at me, Adam.
I am no child.
I've waited a long time to find the kind of a man I could love.
Listen to her, Adam.
You know I don't have any choice.
I'm responsible for Sam Bord!
Thee are not responsible to him.
Thee are responsible to nobody but thyself.
Adam, I beg thee, put away thy gun!
(footsteps approach)
Adam, no, no!
But we befriended thee!
Get out of the way, old man.
I've run all I'm gonna run.
- Hoss, get her out of here!
- Adam!
MATTHEW:
No, no!
Take this back.
I'm all right.
I had to do it.
(cattle bellowing)
(sheep bleating)
Thee are well enough to ride now?
Yes.
Thee will come and visit us?
No, I, I couldn't do that, knowing what it would do to you... and them.
And to thee, Adam?
And me, yes.
He was my father, Adam.
Their leader.
I would be breaking faith with him, and them... and myself, if I...
Neither one of us had a choice, did we?
Bless thee, Adam.

Home.
ANNOUNCER:
This has been a color presentation of the NBC Television Network.
The rules say we have our choice of weapons, mr.
Sledge.
Silly, but what would you expect?
We have fallen among idiots.
Excuse me?
Would you tell mr.
Paladin
That miss windrom is here to see him?
Yes, ma'am.
Miss windrom,
Mr. Paladin is expecting you.
So it would seem.
Follow me, please.
Right here.
Lady coming.
You may make one parting remark.
A time like this, what is there to say?
Oh, uh...
So, this is where you live.
Yes.
It's very much the way I expected.
Well, I'd always thought of it as just a hotel room.
But let me see it through your eyes.
Oh, I'd say the man who lives here
Is unbridled, rigid, austere,
Yet one who likes his comfort as well as luxury,
Though he could never quite forget he was once a soldier.
Someone has been telling you things about me.
Mr. Paladin, back in louisiana,
I'm considered a pretty good judge of horse flesh.
I'd say the standards are not very much different.
Well, there is considerable difference
Between the western mustang
And the pampered geldings that pass for horses
In your part of the country.
I hadn't noticed.
Oh.
Mr. Paladin.
May I pour you a glass of champagne?
Yes.
No.
I really don't have time.
I'm returning to new orleans immediately.
But not tonight.
Yes, I am.
I must.
My father's fighting a duel.
I got the letter this morning.
He's a very proud man, mr.
Paladin.
He'd rather die than yield.
Is that a family trait?
Well, you'd have to know my father
To understand what honor means to him.
"when honor dies,
When faith is lost, the man is dead."
John greenleaf whittier.
Or the other side of the coin, falstaff.
"who hath honor?
He who died a-Wednesday, doth he feel it?
No.
Therefore, I'll none of it."
It's nothing to laugh at.
He's an old man.
And it's what he believes in, right or wrong.
Please.
Will you travel as far as new orleans?
Why?
Because my father's going to be murdered.
He calls it dueling.
But he hasn't held a gun in 30 years.
And it's not dueling.
It's murder, mr.
Paladin.
And you want me to...
Show yourself with father.
Beckley will back out the moment he finds out father has expert help.
"expert."
Well, miss windrom,
Since our relationship has now changed from pleasure to business...
Oh, yes.
Of course.
Your fee.
Mm.
But, paladin?
Hmm?
When this is all over,
When you have saved my father's...
Oh, mr.
Paladin.
Madam.
Your name's paladin, eh?
Nothing better to do than prance around my daughter?
You're spilling your drink.
Allison tell you what happened to the last one?
The one before me?
Graham beckley.
I threw my drink in his face.
You didn't.
At the club.
In front of a dozen witnesses.
I warned the young pup to stay away from allison.
And I packed her off to san francisco so he'd have to.
He had the impudence to demand an explanation.
And you gave him one?
Right in the face.
That ever happen to you, mr.
Paladin?
Father!
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna do it to mr.
Paladin.
What did mr.
Beckley do?
What could he do?
He makes the pretense of being a gentleman.
So he had no choice but to challenge me to a duel.
You brought me all the way from san francisco for this?
His life is in danger.
And at his age, he could easily get killed.
There must be somebody in the entire city of new orleans
Who can talk some sense into his head?
Try it, mr.
Paladin.
You'll know why I brought you all the way from california.
When does this bloodletting take place?
Friday. 5:00 a.M.
Since you're allison's guest,
I suppose I'll have to invite you to be present.
This is by invitation only?
Certainly.
I expect 40 or 50 people, at least.
Call it off.
Never.
I was insulted.
I'll have satisfaction.
Do you think young beckley will dare fight me?
I'm an old man.
He'd be stoned out of town.
Wait and see.
In the end, he'll turn tail like a yellow dog.
In front of 40 or 50 people.
That'll teach him a lesson he'll never get over.
Now do you see what I mean?
He doesn't need any help.
This whole thing's a farce.
No, mr.
Paladin.
Graham beckley will not back down.
Father is wrong in thinking he has nothing to win by fighting.
Oh?
What does he have to gain?
His self-respect.
He's every bit as proud as father.
And what else?
You?
I can't help what graham thinks.
All right.
I'll stop him.
Can you tell me which one of these gentlemen is mr.
Beckley?
Thank you.
Mr. Beckley?
I'm afraid you have the advantage of me, sir.
My name is paladin.
I'd like to talk to you.
In a moment, when I've finished here.
Now, mr.
Beckley.
Why, mr.
Paladin,
Must it be right now?
Because my time is too valuable
To be wasted on matters of such stupidity.
May I trouble you to explain that remark, sir?
I'll be very happy to.
I'm referring to the public spectacle of Friday.
Oh?
And in what way does this concern you?
I've been asked to put a stop to it.
Really?
Well, I must say, mr.
Paladin,
That you're a singular choice for a mediator.
For one thing, sir, this time and place indicates
A shocking disregard for good taste.
And for another thing,
I personally find your manner most obnoxious.
However, certain overtures have been made,
And it's only right that I acknowledge them.
Very well, mr.
Paladin.
These are my terms.
Since my worthy opponent chose to insult me in public
In front of witnesses,
I shall accept an apology delivered in the same way
And in the same place.
That's all.
I believe it's my move, henry.
Mr. Beckley,
Windrom is not going to apologize
Any time or any place.
Very well.
I shall await his convenience next Friday morning.
Windrom is a fool.
And the only difference between the two of you is 30 years.
He's too old to fight a duel.
Well, then, may I assume, mr.
Paladin,
That you are not too old, sir?
No.
No, I'm not too old.
Nor is 5:00 a.M. Too early for me to rise.
Well, in that case, sir...
Not necessary, mr.
Beckley.
I have already accepted the challenge on behalf of mr.
Windrom.
You...
You did what?
That's absolutely ridiculous, sir.
Well, I never heard of such a thing.
It's in absolute violation of the dueling code.
I'll be there, mr.
Beckley.
And...
Now...
It's your move.
Paladin!
You nincompoop.
I ought to have you horse-whipped within an inch of your life.
By what right do you interfere...
This will steady your nerves.
Father!
Mr. Paladin!
I suppose you put him up to it.
Yes, I did.
Then you're as big an imbecile as he is.
You know what you did with your stupid meddling?
Saved your life, most likely.
Why, I am not certain.
You cheated me out of my satisfaction.
I had beckley right where I wanted him.
He'd have been forced to back down.
Mr. Windrom, you are a fool.
Beckley would have killed you and married your daughter
As soon as you were in the ground.
What?
And if you had backed down at the last moment,
Which is extremely likely,
Not even your servants would have taken orders
From you any longer.
I offered you both a chance to save face.
It was a mistake.
I withdraw.
Oh, no, you don't, paladin.
It's not as simple as that.
Beckley is getting somebody to do his fighting for him.
He sent for a texan, a hired gunfighter.
And just what do you propose to do about that?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
He wins by default.
But this is an affair of honor.
Mr. Windrom, the amount of honor I have involved is so slight
That I'm not concerned about it.
It will be no reflection on you
When this texan scares me out of new orleans.
In that event, sir,
I have no option but to face this ruffian myself.
It's not something I could expect you to understand.
Among gentlemen,
Life without honor is meaningless.
This thing's gone beyond apologies or retreat.
It can be settled in only one way.
If you refuse to meet your obligations,
I'll do it for you.
Mr. Paladin!
He means it.
And against a gunfighter, he wouldn't stand a chance.
There has to be a fight?
That it?
Neither beckley nor I would be satisfied with anything less.
How much blood will you settle for?
It's open.
You bill sledge?
I once knew a man
That could make a coin vanish right in front of your eyes.
Bring it back, too.
That's the part of the trick I never mastered.
Well, didn't help him much.
He died broke.
Getting back to your question, I am bill sledge.
My name is paladin.
You're a couple of days early, ain't ya?
Not why I'm here.
I never ran into this kind of fighting in texas.
I hear tell there's rules.
Somebody else is supposed to do the talking.
You pay much attention to rules?
I never have yet.
Have a seat, paladin.
Thank you.
Been in town long?
Most of a week.
I only got here this morning.
Maybe you can tell me why I'm gonna kill you.
Mr. Sledge, I'm not even clear on why I'm gonna kill you.
There was a time when a man brought a fight with him,
He had to bring a reason, too.
Now I just ask how much it pays and let it go at that.
There's no land, no cattle, no water rights involved.
What's left?
Nothing.
They just want the sight of blood.
Oh.
Well, they ain't paying enough anyway.
Heading back to california?
I'll ride as far as texas with you.
No.
There's got to be a fight.
You fast with a gun, paladin?
If I'd lost many, I wouldn't be here.
How are you with your fists?
Why?
These rules say that we get the choice of weapons.
Oh.
Well, a man's got to start living by the rules
Sooner or later.
Still seems kind of silly.
Mr. Sledge, what can you expect?
We have fallen among idiots.
Where is your sporting blood, gentlemen?
I am offering you 3-2 odds on beckley's gladiator.
Well, it's your last chance.
Tomorrow's the big day.
Which one of you gentlemen can I mark down for, say,
A hundred dollars?
Now, there's a man with convictions.
You are on, sir.
To be paid on the first man to draw blood.
Now, anyone else?
I was just on my way out, sir.
The club is yours.
Stay if you like.
I can avoid you until morning.
Yes, of course.
Now, if you have any confidence in your man,
I'm sure harry will be only too happy to accommodate you.
I'll have the best of that bargain.
Losing my money would be compensated by getting rid of paladin.
The man is a rough diamond, sir.
But it seems to appeal to allison.
Then she's gone from bad to worse.
I'll give you this much, beckley.
You at least behave like a gentleman.
Well, thank you, sir.
It's small credit to me.
I completely lost my head.
A weakness of youth.
You'll overcome it in time.
Now, sir, that's very handsome of you.
Graham?
I think you ought to know...
Good evening, sir.
Graham, all bets are off.
I will not be a party to such a farce.
Now, what are you talking about?
We have been taken.
There's not going to be a duel.
What?
Those men have agreed to brawl with their fists.
Why, we'd be the laughingstock of new orleans.
Are you positive of this, sir?
I have it on the best of authority.
It seems that your man paladin has developed cold feet.
Speak for your own man, beckley.
Very well, sir, I will.
I'll guarantee that my man will appear on the field of honor
Completely armed.
The rest is up to you.
Then tell him to defend himself.
Paladin will have a gun.
Paladin?
Hmm?
Am I intruding?
I hope not, my dear.
I don't want you to be alone tonight.
I was just enjoying the moonlight.
It is a beautiful night.
Paladin?
Hmm?
Do you remember that night...
It seems so long ago.
In san francisco?
I remember it vividly.
We didn't have time for that glass of champagne.
So I made you a promise.
Tomorrow might be too late.
And the garden's like a picture in a book.
None of it's real, is it?
Your father and his friends
Making ridiculous rules and games about killing.
You making a sport out of love,
Trying to pretend it's all so sad, so tragic.
In killing...
Or in making love,
I don't pretend.
I took the liberty.
In this case, mr.
Windrom, that is the wrong weapon.
But this is an affair of honor.
It'll be fought as such.
You'll get your carnival.
I'll do it my own way.
You think so?
Then you're the only one who does.
Your opponent will have a pistol under his shirt.
You may believe me, mr.
Paladin.
Beckley has offered the texan double price.
If you walk out there unarmed, it'll cost you your life.
I don't believe you.
Sir, I must protest these arrangements.
This is not a dueling with pistols.
Both weapons are equal, aren't they?
Yes, but...
Then get on with your instructions.
Why bother?
Not one of the rules applies here.
You will stand back-to-back.
On my signal, the word "now,"
You will each take ten paces in a direct line,
Turn and fire.
There's a doctor in attendance.
Good luck.
Whenever you're ready, mr.
Paladin.
What's the job pay now?
Winner take all.
Worth that much to you?
Money, no.
But I only got one life.
That's what I thought.
They sold us both the same bill of goods.
You wearing a gun under that shirt?
That's right.
Gentlemen, are you ready?
They must've talked it over.
What else is there to fight about?
You ask me for a reason, I can't give you one.
But they want blood.
Ten paces enough?
Not for me.
Just keep right on walking.
Never look back.
Now.
Well, what did you expect?
A slight flesh wound to save the honor
Of two men who never had any?
That's what you paid for.
Go ahead.
Enjoy it.
You've had your blood.
Let's celebrate.
Have a drink.
Step up.
You want a drink?
No?
All right!
Tell you why you can't drink.
You couldn't keep it down.
A toast to you, gentlemen.
And to you, allison,
The one we didn't have in san francisco.
Gentlemen,
To you and your code.

PARADISE
TO EACH THEIR OWN LIFE
Stop drinking, Mundito.
Leave me, Rosa.
You're killing yourself.
That's what I want: to end it.
Come to my room and rest a while.
We have to bring in the New Year right.
I don't want to see the birth of another year.
I want to die with this one.
And who will play the piano?
Come on, don't be like that.
Come with me.
There goes Mundo again, drunk as always.
Delmira says Modesto brought him here.
Found him half-dead at The Screw.
Poor guy.
He came here with such dreams in his youth, and ended up in this dump.
The Missus forgot the cider and we'll need it.
- But nobody orders it, Don Pepe.
- Except on the 31st.
Mexicans do everything by the calendar, but in Spain...
Always complaining about Mexico!
About Mexico?
Kid, you don't know what you're talking about.
How could I complain about where my wife and kids were born?
- I'm more Mexican...
- Than "pulque", I know!
I don't want you souring my mood!
Finish cleaning those tables and tell the Missus to send the cider.
Move it!
Okay, but don't get mad at me.
Remember that it's New Year's Eve.
Seems I'll have my hands full tonight.
It's like witchcraft:
If she arrives first, she'll leave last, after a bunch of fights.
AlwaysAlive, if you're broke, go somewhere else.
- Hear that?
- Talking to me?
- No, to the Infanta Maria Cristina.
I had the pleasure of meeting her in Spain's royal court.
- Waiter!
- Yes, AlwaysAlive?
I'm Maria de la Soledad Ordoñez, widow of Moncada.
That's just for friends.
For you all, I'm Doña Soledad.
Bring me a well-prepared absinthe.
- I told you, if you've got no dough...
- Will this be enough?
Bring her a Pernod with water.
At your service, Doña Soledad.
Cleaned up at bingo night, eh?
Leave me.
But I'm warning you:
any trouble and you're gone.
Last time, you broke 20 glasses and two tables.
- Do I owe anything?
- No, that idiot paid for it all.
Chivalry isn't dead.
- I told you, if you want a fight...
- Leave me!
Is it "well-burned"?
- What's that?
- Have her explain!
I want to be alone.
No one should bother me.
- Good evening.
- 'Evening.
Hi, Don Pepe.
Happy New Year.
It's not even midnight yet.
Grouchy as usual.
- Hey, Chucho.
- Hey, Pepsi-Cola.
How'd it go with that old man last night?
Did you hear that Mundo is near death?
But he was just here playing.
Heels took him upstairs stone-drunk.
Modesto found him half-dead at The Screw.
- Right, Modesto?
- Yeah, I had to bring him.
I heard his daughter's rich.
- I asked if I should call her.
- And?
- He refused.
- Why bother?
- Why refuse?
- Said it was pointless.
- Sure, with the life he led...
- Led?
- Leads.
Always drunk.
- So?
- What daughter wants to see that?
- Any one!
- Oh please!
- And then what?
- Heels took him upstairs.
I went up to charge her for nylons and she told me she made him open up.
How'd she do it?
Well, she was already kind of drunk, so she couldn't explain well.
- Drunk?
- You know...
She says she drank for the courage to hear him through.
I swear, Heels is one hell of a woman.
He said it was hopeless, that we should let him die in peace.
Another absinthe, garçon!
Coming!
"Garçon"?
What's up with her?
That broad's here.
Serve her, Modesto.
Chucho, I said go talk to the Missus.
I'm going, Don Pepe.
- Should we tell her about Mundo?
- Who?
- AlwaysAlive.
- Why?
Seems they were close, and I heard that some time ago...
Must've been a long time ago.
Chucho!
Have Domitilo come play piano.
Must be across the street, still in bed.
I'm going.
- You tell her.
- No, I can't stand her.
- Chucho!
- I'll be right back.
Rum, please.
- Straight?
- Yeah, a double.
Here.
Hey Pepsi, do you think he needs anything?
Mundo?
I don't know.
Why?
No, it's nothing.
When the Missus comes, I'll check on him.
Hey, you're not so mean, so why do you pretend you are?
- Another one?
- On the house?
- Sure!
- Planning to suggest we get a room?
- Oh Pepsi...
- 'Evening.
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Okay, you?
- Awful.
Didn't make a thing last night.
- You did, right?
- Some.
- Hope today's better, but it's empty.
- They'll come late today.
Hope so, because I have to buy medicine and it's so expensive.
- Your son still sick?
- Doctor says he's anemic.
- What's that?
- Weakness.
- But he eats well.
- Look who's here.
- Who?
- Pretend he's not here.
Talk to me.
- Eyes?
- Talk to me.
- He still angry?
- He's touchy, you know him.
Last night he hit me just for not having his daily cut.
- I don't know how you stand it.
- What choice do I have?
Are you in love?
Well, no point in lying.
I am.
Modesto!
A Cuba Libre.
You?
- You buying?
- First one, yes.
- A Cuba Libre.
There's that damn Jarocha.
Guess what she made me last night.
- What?
- Not a cent.
But I'll get her back today.
Hey, what's with you, Bridge?
- Why?
- For days, you've seemed off, as if...
- As if what?
- As if you were in love.
Me?
You don't talk to the guys anymore and you drink alone.
Why?
- That's how I am.
- No, man.
You've got real class and you can do as you please.
Nobody'd dispute that.
And?
Nothing...
- Are the guys ready for tomorrow?
- Yeah, just say the word.
- You explained it all?
- Every bit.
Hey, will it be really dangerous?
- You afraid?
- With you around?
Nope.
Modesto!
Another Pernod, and a tequila.
This'll get her drunk, but if she makes trouble, I'll...
- A double rum, Don Pepe.
- This early?
- For a happy year's end.
- Suit yourself.
Back at last.
- What did the Missus say?
- She seemed a bit tipsy and said...
- Can I say it?
- Yes.
- She said that you can go...!
OK, I'll imagine the rest.
And the cider?
Said she might bring it, but if not, then you can go...!
I got it!
Well, what's it to me?
It's her bar.
- And Domitilo?
- Once he's up, he'll come.
All right.
- I'm thinking...
- What?
I keep thinking we should tell AlwaysAlive about Mundo.
- Want me to tell her?
- No, wait.
- A perico.
- A perico?
- On my tab.
- 'Evening, congressman.
- Hey there.
This place is deserted.
Didn't you say it was a great spot?
Let's go.
Be patient.
It starts moving at midnight, you'll see.
Hope so, because I feel like having some fun.
- How'd you skip out on the wife?
- Said there's an extraordinary session.
That's nuts.
Now, on New Year's Eve?
- She's used to it.
- And she believed you?
You think anybody believes us?
Not even the people do, man.
- You like her?
- Who?
- Don't play dumb.
Sorrow.
Hey, Bridge.
Did you really offer her a drink and she refused?
Me?
That's what I heard, but I didn't believe them.
Why?
Well, she'd be the first.
- Would it be so weird?
- With you, yes.
- Why?
- They all fall at your feet.
You know what?
Before we were friends, I hated you for it.
- Why?
- I would say, "What do broads see in him?".
Of course the important thing is what you've got: class.
"Personality", like the Missus says.
- The Missus?
- Yeah, the owner.
She must've been a looker, don't you think?
- Maybe.
- I think she likes you.
Enough!
- If you don't wanna talk, I'll go.
- Like I care.
In an afternoon at the bullring...
I saw a cute guy bullfight...
I told you: here we go!
with his night cape...
And he told me... he told me...
What did he tell me?
To sew his cape, gorgeous!
Gorgeous...!
- Who called me gorgeous?
- I did, doll!
- Stop, she's a pest!
- Don't ruin it!
Want to drink with me?
A drink?
- And who are you?
- Me?
Your grandson, doll!
Go screw your grandma!
No broad says that to me!
Don't!
- Get off her!
- You someone to her?
- Let's pretend I am.
- Know who I am?
- You tell me.
- I'll show you!
Gentlemen, please!
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's go somewhere else.
Just stay, sir.
Drinks all around, on the house!
Thanks, boss.
My grandson!
You wish!
- Calm down, AlwaysAlive!
- Or better yet, go!
I warned you.
No!
- I have money to buy everyone drinks!
- Next time...!
- Stop!
- So, we going or what?
- No, man.
We're staying.
This is gonna be fun.
- What'll it be?
- The same for us.
Wait!
Get her a drink.
I want her to toast with me.
Me?
- Drop dead!
- Well, your loss!
Want a drink?
No thanks.
- Why not?
- Don't feel like it.
- Even if I buy?
- Come on, have one.
- Really, no thanks.
- I'll have one with you.
- If you want.
This is my first time offering anyone here a drink.
- Know why?
- No.
- Because they're beneath me.
- You seem different.
- Different?
Sure, we all make a living the same way, but there are categories.
Me, for instance...
Chucho!
I was a great lady... born into a great family and...
Bring the absinthe from my table and a double tequila.
- And for you?
- Nothing.
Get an anisette, at least, and a drink token.
- And a token...
- Get one before midnight.
- And you?
- Me?
I already got some earlier.
- Get her an anisette.
- Okay.
- But no token.
- I'll take the token.
Well, as I was saying...
But first, one question.
- Why are you always so sad?
- Don't know, just am.
Well, you mustn't be like that, because in our job well, you know.
That's the trouble with these girls:
They do it for pleasure but they'll never be more than enthusiasts.
See how easy it is to laugh?
Come on, today I'm feeling sentimental.
- Tell me something.
- About what?
- Your life.
What for?
It's just like everyone else's.
No, dear.
Everyone has their life, each unique, even if they seem alike.
- Hey... what's your name?
- Raquel.
I like that name.
I had an Aunt Raquel.
Well, let's have a toast.
Hey, isn't there music here?
It's like a funeral.
The band just arrived, sir.
- Another round?
- Why not?
But with some company, at least.
Invite that girl to drink with us.
The other one too so fatso isn't lonely.
No, I'll wait for Golden Heels.
I agreed to meet her.
"Golden Heels"...!
What a name!
- So, the same?
- What do you think, idiot?
Two Pepsi Cuba Libres.
Jarocha, the congressman invited you to a drink.
Congressman?
Go!
He's got money.
You can get back at your man.
I would, to teach him a lesson, but...
- But what?
- He's very touchy.
And?
Mind your business!
Hey, take it easy.
He dislikes me drinking with other men in front of him.
Why did he come?
Maybe to find me.
- Don't you think?
- Maybe.
Two Pepsi Cuba Libres, coming out!
Coming or not?
Well, no.
What do I tell him?
Say I'll come soon, that I'm handling a thing.
Whatever.
How can you let them exploit you?
If I were a woman...!
Where's that girl?
She'll be right over.
She's just handling a thing.
To heck with her.
- They're all stuck-up here.
- No, man.
Even the old hag!
I had a daughter, you know.
But let's talk about something else.
- Want me to talk about my life?
- If you want.
I'll tell you as if you were my daughter, because you could be, even if you don't look like it.
They call me AlwaysAlive because they're jealous, just to bug me.
They think the name bothers me.
They don't know I actually like it, because that's how I feel:
Always alive.
And for me life comes first.
Life?
I've liked it since I was a girl.
And love, of course because without love, life is worthless.
Because life is love.
I didn't care for expensive toys or dresses from Paris, or the cars that my mother rode to the opera in, all covered in diamonds.
I always sought someone to love, even if he was a servant in my house.
So long as it was love...
Hey, doll!
- Why so uptight?
- Me, uptight?
- You're not?
- I'll be over soon.
- Why not now?
- Why'd you come then?
- Go with him.
- Not by force!
- And you?
- Me what?
- Name it, doll.
- 'Cause you're a bigshot?
- Well, not to brag...
- Big deal!
- Why get involved, Pepsi-Cola?
- Ignore him, girl.
Oh wow, "Pepsi-Cola"...!
Got a problem with that?
- I like you, come drink.
- And Jarocha?
- I changed my mind.
- I didn't.
- Coming or not?
- Nobody bullies my friend!
Don't argue, come have a drink.
- You've nothing to lose.
- Except your...
Go with them or I'll kick you out.
Who do you think you are?
"Mouse" Macías?
- You two coming or what?
- I'll take the "what".
- OK, I'll go.
- Both of you!
- Not her.
- Why not?
- She's got a husband.
- What?
- A husband?
- Over there.
- Where?
Expect me to ask permission?
- Want something?
- Stay out of it.
- Yes sir, I do.
I'd like to ask if it's okay for your wife to drink with me.
- Up to her.
- Hear that?
- I don't want to.
- Go on, drink.
- No!
- We having that drink or not?
- Come on, don't beg her.
Fine, then.
Stay with your "husband".
- Another perico.
- You gonna pay?
- I can't.
Why didn't you go?
- I'm talking to you.
- To me?
To you!
Let me go!
- Drink with them, or I'll...
- Bastard!
Want a replay of last night?
No.
Don't get mad.
Then?
But you hate me drinking in front of you with other men.
- He's different.
- Why?
He's a congressman.
He must have loads of dough.
- After you leave.
- I said drink with him.
If you leave, I'll do it.
I can't leave.
Why?
- I have a thing to handle.
- With who?
- That's my business.
If I see you with another woman, I'll scar you up!
- Don't be silly.
- You know I will!
Who are you expecting?
A guy friend.
Really?
You'll see.
All right.
Want a drink?
- Here?
- Why not?
No woman buys me drinks where she works.
You going with them?
All right, but...
If I had a daughter like you...
You'd be used to it, eh?
Tramps!
That's what you are.
The band wants a round to start warming up.
They never have money!
But all right, give it to them.
- Excuse me, officer.
- Yes?
- Do you know Dorita?
- Who doesn't?
Is she here yet?
There she is.
How's it going, professor!
You came, like you do every year!
- Great to see you!
- Good evening, Dorita.
Hey, go in.
They don't bite!
Thank you, Dorita.
Hey, blue.
- Hey, Don Pepe!
- Dorita!
- Want to sit with me?
- Yes.
- You buying?
- That's what I came for.
- Then come on, professor.
Hey, just what we needed:
it's the professor.
Hello, professor.
How was your year?
Same as all the others, Don Pepe.
Same as all the others.
- No hello for me, Don Pepe?
- Hello, Dorita.
What a surprise.
That's me, full of surprises.
Long time no see.
It's just that I work at the Thief's place now.
You know.
But, well...
I can't complain.
But today I thought, "I'll go say hi to Don Pepe."
Thank you.
"And the professor, who'll go to celebrate New Year's like always."
I got here and there he was, too shy to come in.
No, it's not that...
- You know you're always welcome.
- Thank you.
What'll it be?
Me, I'll start with a tequila!
A double, please.
- Your usual absinthe?
- Well... yes.
- But the good stuff, eh?
- Oh Dorita...
An absinthe and a double tequila!
Times sure are hard, eh?
Well... yes.
Very hard, yes.
- And with kids to feed...
- How many kids do you have?
Well... nine.
Damn!
Sorry, it slipped out.
You're excused.
- I'm what?
- "Excused", Dorita.
Don't be embarrassed.
The professor's just very proper.
Oh, okay.
- A toast, professor?
- To your health.
- To your health!
- To yours!
- To my what?
- Your health, I said.
- Oh, okay.
Come on!
Play something with some flavor!
They're waiting on the pianist.
He'll come soon.
He better hurry or I'll play piano with my gun.
"Gun"...
I'll show it to you.
Oh, I forgot to tell AlwaysAlive.
What should I do?
- What is it now?
- Some thing.
- Another?
- Yeah.
Set up an office, eh?
Want me to tell her?
No, wait.
I'll work up the nerve.
The same for me, and another anisette.
All right.
Bridge, come here.
- Yes, ma'am?
- I'll buy you a drink, and don't call me ma'am.
- I'm on my way out.
- Wait, I want to thank you.
- For what?
- Standing up for me.
- You're a gentleman.
- Well, so long.
- I said wait!
I want to introduce you to my friend.
- I know her.
- I don't think you do.
Come.
You afraid of him?
Afraid?
Well, shake hands.
Bridge...
Coming back?
If I can.
Will you snub me?
No.
Should we expect you?
Yes.
You better come back!
Let's go dance!
- Shall we?
- I don't...
- Come on, it's New Year's Eve!
All right, Dorita.
Get off me, you bastard!
Hurray for Golden Heels!
"Golden Heels" is done.
Stop playing!
Stop it!
I said stop it!
Who's playing the piano?
Get away!
Nobody can play the piano here.
The piano is dead.
Mundo.
Mundito!
I can't believe it.
Calm down, Rosa.
Calm down.
Come on, come on.
But is it true, girl?
Is it?
Calm down and tell us.
We left him at the funeral parlor.
He grabbed my hand... and the last thing he told me was to tell AlwaysAlive.
Always...
AlwaysAlive!
Why didn't you go?
- Why?
- May he rest in peace.
Forgive me, Always.
Forgive me!
May God forgive him.
- Should we go see him?
- Yes, but first let's pray.
Eternal rest, grant unto him, o Lord.
And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.
Hey.
Hey.
Want another one?
You buying?
Modesto!
Two Cuba Libres.
- You feeling better?
- Sure, thanks...
- Were you two close?
- Very.
And the old lady?
She was.
Oh, no wonder.
- Aren't we gonna go see him?
- When they get back.
Yeah, don't be rude.
The living need company too.
Right, doll?
- Let's go have a drink.
- You got it.
- Come on, girl.
- What'll you have?
- A cognac.
- A cognac?
Told you she's tough.
- She doesn't drink cheap like you.
- Got a problem?
- Me?
Drink all the water here for all I care.
After all, it's New Year's Eve.
Three cognacs and a colored water for her.
Wait.
I'll have cognac too to shut them up.
Have whatever.
I'm buying, aren't I?
- That's why.
- See, she's surly.
- So what?
- Well...
Move it, man!
Gonna cheer up now?
Why not?
What I can't get over is praying in a bar.
These broads are so strange.
- Why strange?
Don't we dance too?
- That's different.
- Why?
- I'm just respecting the dead, because otherwise...
- Otherwise what?
No, no, but seriously: how can you believe in that nonsense?
We're nearly in the 21st century and our people are still drowning in superstition.
If you cared, you'd be elsewhere.
- Yep!
- Where should I be?
I come to...
Ah, he's gonna say the same thing as that "screenwriter".
What does he say?
That he comes here to take in the setting and study us.
No, of course not!
And after studying us, he leaves totally hammered, and gets what he can.
These broads really make you laugh, man.
- You have to admit: they're great!
- That they are!
This tastes like water.
Chucho!
You're right.
Why try to cheat me?
- What is it?
- You know what?
Bring a bottle of Five-X to speed this up.
Of course, sir.
I got so sad, I lost my buzz.
- And I don't want that.
- Why?
- It kills the sadness.
Sorry, professor.
I couldn't help myself.
You're excused.
What?
Oh, I remember!
- Cheers, professor.
- Cheers.
- Come on, don't get depressed on me!
- I'm not, Dorita.
Cheers.
We barely have time to get happy.
It's true.
Are you sad?
The news about Mundito shocked me.
Yeah, me too.
We toasted together every year.
Remember?
Yeah.
Last year...
- Let's talk about happier things, okay?
- All right, Dorita.
Cheers.
The next-to-last drinks of the year.
Yes, the next-to-last ones.
Come on, down the hatch, for some pick-me-up.
Oh Dorita, you're so nice.
- Do you like me?
- I think you're fantastic.
- I'm inviting you.
- Where to?
Upstairs, behind closed doors.
Let's go.
- Should we take a bottle?
- If you wish.
A bottle of Five-X!
Open it, eh?
Thanks, Don Pepe.
Go in, my dear professor!
- Another year goes by.
- And a new one comes in.
- Finish your drink, eh?
- All right, Dorita.
- Want a little cognac?
- All right.
Come to think of it, I've called you Pancho before.
After all these years, shouldn't I use your first name?
As you wish, Dorita.
I think I feel better now.
We've gotta ring in the new year the right way.
- The right way?
- Yeah.
Oh Dorita, you're so nice.
Do you really like me?
Like I said, I think you're fantastic!
Unzip me.
Know what, Bobby?
What?
I don't get you, man.
You've got all that money, a mansion in Lomas, and a Cadillac, and still come every night to get drunk and chase these hookers and muster the courage to go on living.
That's how it is, even if you don't get it.
The same.
And you?
Same.
- It's just that you're kinda...
- Kinda what?
Well, kinda tight-assed, man.
Shut up!
I told you not to talk to me that way.
- Wanna fight?
- With you?
- You think I can't?
Let's change the subject.
How'd your year go?
- Not as well as yours.
- Oh really?
Got grounded at home?
Listen, Eyes.
- Watch it, or you'll be sorry.
- Don't be like that.
What?
You're gonna kill me?
You're not worth it.
Or kill yourself?
Sit down!
Sit down.
Two Cuba Libres.
Who's paying?
You're all out to humiliate me today.
- Do I owe you?
- Not me.
- Then?
- Boss's orders.
- What?
- You drink, you pay.
- Oh come on...
- I'll pay.
Well, cheers.
Cheers.
- Hey Eyes, you buying?
- If you want.
But no funny business.
Don't be mean.
- Your friend won't mind?
- Why would I?
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Well, introduce us, eh?
A friend.
- Lila Hernandez, at your service.
- A pleasure.
- If Jarocha comes, I'm outta here.
- Why?
- She might hit you.
Me?
- Excuse me.
- Where you going?
Is he mad?
What do I care?
Seems a bit light in the loafers.
You think?
His problem.
Like AlwaysAlive says, "to each their own life", eh?
That girl's getting on my nerves.
Why?
She's a sleaze.
And a slut.
Let her be.
- Maybe you like him.
- Who?
Who do you think?
That guy.
Me?
That's like casting pearls before swine!
Amen!
- So why are you mad?
- Because he's my friend's man.
Right, Heels!
So what?
Nobody steps out on my friends.
I like that!
Want me to get him out of there?
Like I'm not man enough!
More man than him, I bet!
Another, you bastard!
Another!
Go or I'll call the cops.
I don't want troublemakers.
Pour me another one!
Another!
Another!
Pay for the last one!
I've got no money.
They robbed me at the bar next door.
Thieves robbed me.
- Kick him out!
- Nobody kicks me out!
Let me go!
I said let me go!
Get lost!
Get lost?
Sucks to that!
Serve me another.
Get out already!
Oh, now you're brave...
You cowards!
Two against one!
I want the Spaniard!
Let's see if he can take me!
Get out here!
Come on!
Let him go!
Do it!
Stand aside!
You going or not?
Don't get mad, boss.
I just want another drink.
Here.
Everyone walks all over me!
I'm gonna kill myself!
Get back!
I swore to kill myself the day I couldn't work anymore!
I won't depend on anyone!
Not even on my kids!
My hand won't shake this time!
It won't!
No!
Give me the razor, sir, please.
Give it to me.
Come on, pal.
Calm down, calm down.
Don't worry.
Tomorrow you'll be fine.
- Want someone to walk you home?
- No!
I don't want to go home!
No!
- Want that drink?
- No, I don't want a thing!
Not a thing!
My razor!
I want my razor!
I want my razor!
You'll get it back tomorrow.
They stole my razor and my money!
My razor!
My razor!
Maybe we should've let him.
Let him what?
Kill himself.
Think he would've?
Why not?
- Life's not worth living like that.
- How?
- Without dreams.
Think he has any?
He did.
For what?
His job.
Dreams for a job?
You don't have any for yours, right?
Well, honestly, no.
I pity you.
Wait, help me understand here.
Do you have dreams?
One.
For... this?
Not this.
But it's your job, isn't it?
Apparently so.
What do you mean, apparently?
Go on, explain it to me.
For me, life is about loving.
That's all:
loving.
Don't tell me you're here for that.
Here I found my dreams, and here I remain.
Until when?
Until he needs me.
"He"?
Because I'm different when I think about him.
Different how?
I'm someone else.
Someone good.
You're in love.
I'm...
I don't know the words.
And he loves you?
I don't know.
- But I do know one thing.
- What?
He'll need me one day.
Just me.
Understand?
Just me.
Just you...
But not for what you think.
All men need that and all women have it.
- What, then?
I don't know.
For something really big even if it's only for a day.
Tell me...
Is he married?
- I haven't asked.
- And he hasn't told you.
- We don't talk about him.
- What do you talk about?
- Things.
Him, me...
God.
- God?
- Why not?
Must be a strange guy.
He's different.
With me, at least.
See him often?
When he wants to, he comes, and he goes.
And you wait for him?
Always.
And before you met him?
I was waiting to meet him.
And when that thing happens, when he needs you for that huge thing, and you help him, and he stops needing you, what'll you do?
- Die.
- Kill yourself?
No.
Just die.
That must be...
That must be love, right?
Love?
Yes.
I think so.
Did AlwaysAlive leave?
Yes.
- Will she be back?
- She's at the funeral parlor.
- The funeral parlor?
- To keep vigil over Mundito.
When did he die?
A while ago.
Poor guy.
Maybe he's happy.
Happy?
Yes.
Up there.
"Up there"!
You don't believe in God?
- You do?
- What else could I believe in?
- I don't know.
- What do you believe in?
In life.
In life?
- In this life?
- No, not this one.
In what one?
In love.
In love?
Don't laugh!
Bridge!
You said love, didn't you?
You said love.
I don't know.
You're ashamed.
Me too.
- I think that's why I laughed.
- I don't know why I said it.
You said it.
You did.
I can't believe in it.
Why not?
Because I'm the worst, aren't I?
A hustler, a thief.
Does all that weigh on you?
No.
Let's dance and drink.
If you want.
- What do you want?
- An anisette.
- And you, Bridge?
- Cognac.
Why wouldn't you sit with me the other day?
I was afraid.
Of me?
- Yes.
- Why were you afraid?
- Because of my reputation?
- No, not that.
Then what?
I was afraid you'd be different.
Different?
That you'd be good.
Me, good?
You're not, right?
Say you're not.
And if I were good... to you?
Why to me?
Because...
- No, you'll laugh again.
- I swear I won't.
Because I love you.
"Because I love you"...?
That's what that jerk is doing to me:
Making my life miserable, professor.
Miserable, professor.
Absolutely miserable.
It must be nice to love like that.
Very nice!
And I'd do anything for him!
I'd even leave this life.
But he says he likes me because I'm this...
Just some you-know-what!
Don't cry, Dorita.
Don't cry.
I'm not.
I'm just remembering.
That's why he hits me.
Because he likes that I am what I am.
He hits you?
And you let him?
I don't "let him"!
I want him to!
The day he stops hitting me it'll be because he doesn't love me anymore.
Anything but that, professor.
He has to love me even if he doesn't want to.
Because that's how it is.
I've never loved like that.
How could you?
You don't know what it's like to love.
That much?
No.
I bet you've never truly loved anyone.
Who?
Well, many years ago...
Who?
My wife.
Then you've never loved anyone.
That's not love.
Definitely not your wife.
Why not?
Because she's old and ugly.
And because she's your wife.
I saw her last year when she came to get you at dawn, like she does every year.
Old... and ugly!
Old... and ugly?
Well, but you, on the other hand...
Me?
What about me, Dorita?
You're not that bad-looking yet.
But the clock's ticking.
If you don't hurry...
If I don't hurry...
I really still deserve...?
Well, what are you waiting for, professor?
What, what am I waiting for?
Dorita, don't get my hopes up.
- With me, professor?
- With you.
You're not old or ugly.
I need a woman who values me.
You don't know what it's like to go years and years... with a wife as she grows fat, and bears children and wrinkles up, and stares at the ceiling when you look at her.
You don't know what it's like to feel it all coming to an end, and not have the guts to cheat one day to prove you're still a man.
And when that day comes... you drink for courage, get drunk since your fear is too great... and then, after you conquer your fear, your head says "yes"... it screams "yes" but you feel your body not responding.
You keep drinking, drowning yourself in it but you don't dare to make a move.
Not one!
Not one!
Calm down, my dear professor.
Calm down.
Don't get all dramatic on me.
- Aren't you with me?
- Yes, Dorita, yes.
I'm with you.
With you.
And I'm not drunk, right?
Right, I'm not drunk?
I can dare to do anything, right?
Why not?
With luck, you can still do it.
You'll love me a little, Dorita, right?
To go as far as loving you...
I already told you.
When it comes to love, true love there's only him.
But after all no one ever denies this or a drink of water to anyone.
Really, Dorita?
You're serious?
All right, my dear professor.
Take off my stockings.
Get dressed, Dorita.
It's useless.
Did you see him?
Yes.
I've always liked seeing the dead.
Why?
Because, after seeing them I felt more alive.
As if I had been reborn.
- But...
- Yes?
...today was different.
He was there... in his coffin... with a very sad smile... as if he'd finally found peace but felt terrible, terrible loneliness.
I felt lonely too.
Lonely in here, as if I'd died for the first time.
You loved him a lot?
Did I love him?
I don't know.
Now I can't even remember if I ever loved him.
No, it must be something else... because I felt as if my body were missing something as if something had broken inside.
Then I realized that everyone was staring at me, as if they were accusing me.
I had never minded people staring, even if they mocked me... but today... today I felt as if I were naked and I was terribly ashamed.
I went out into the street, to breathe the air running, running as if someone were after me.
Then I went into a bar... to drink, to drown myself in it so I wouldn't feel so lonely.
But there she was!
Her!
Who, who?
That woman who curses us all, all us women, and who talks about God and about Hell.
- The Saint?
- Yes.
But she's crazy.
Don't you know that?
Yes, I know.
I've even laughed at her and yelled things at her before.
But tonight... she filled me with fear a terrible fear.
A terrible fear.
What's that?
Oh Bridge, it's you.
I didn't even realize you were here.
- Did you two talk?
- Yes.
Okay.
Never mind me.
You two need to get happy.
The year's about to begin.
A new year.
- How about it, eh?
- All right.
- You too, Bridge?
- Sure.
I'll order a "jukebox".
Chucho!
A "jukebox", an anisette, and a cognac!
Okay, that's enough!
- What do you want with me?
- This'll be fun!
- What's the idea?
- Stay out, bastard.
- Take that back or I'll...
Why not pick on a man, you son of a...!
- Stay out if it!
- You got it, doll.
Will do.
I'm not taking back anything.
Piece of trash!
Leech!
What?
You heard me!
Piece of trash!
Leech!
If you were a man, I'd...
I'm more of one than you, and I'll prove it!
Hurray, Golden Heels!
Hurray!
Beat him up, Rosa!
I won't fight!
Coward!
But I will.
Let's see what happens!
What do you want?
- You something to Eyes?
- I'd rather be dead.
- Then what?
He's my friend's... "husband".
Even if he is trash no broke-ass sleazo hits on him behind her back.
- Certainly not in front of me.
- You don't say!
- Got a knife?
- Let's see it.
- Go on!
- Stop!
Stop, Rosa.
This is my business, don't you think?
You got it, Jarocha.
You're the boss.
I don't want a fight.
Let her, Don Pepe.
After all, it's New Year's Eve!
Let her!
- I don't want the cops here.
- I'll take any blame.
I have immunity.
Me too!
I'm in congress!
Suit yourselves, but hurry, eh?
It's almost midnight.
- What'd you tell Heels?
- Didn't hear?
- I want you to tell me.
- Don't be a bitch.
- Let's go, Jarocha.
- So you like my man, eh?
- What, can't I?
- I noticed it days ago.
- So what?
- I'll give him to you.
- Sure, I'll bet.
- But you gotta provide for him.
- And?
- Pay him daily, starting today.
Let's see if you have enough!
How much is on you?
Let me go, you bitch!
Let go of me!
- Cough it up!
- Let go or I'll cut you!
Cough up the money!
Just you wait, you bitch!
Ten pesos.
Here's your New Year!
But it won't be enough because you're expensive!
Get her!
Ten pesos is nothing for my man so I'm gonna rip that dress off you!
Get her, get her!
Enough, Jarocha!
Enough!
That's so he can sell it, 'cause you don't have enough!
- Enough!
- Shut up, or tomorrow I'll be sending a wreath.
Congressmen don't scare me!
I warned you!
Bridge!
Be damned!
God's punishment will fall on all of you!
On the prostitutes!
On the drunkards!
On the depraved!
The wrath of Saint Paul will destroy this city of sin just as it destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah!
Be damned!
Damn those who murder their children before they're born!
Damn the exploiters of women, and damn homosexuals!
Soon I'll be an old maid!
In June of the year that's about to begin!
My God, I'm so old, so old, my God!
And I haven't managed to find a husband.
It's almost midnight!
Let's toast to the New Year!
Be damned!
Be damned!
Be damned!
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Hold each other.
You can fight next year.
Come on, girl.
It's no use being sad.
Put this on.
I've a right to defend myself.
That's why the revolution was made.
By who?
Mr. Madero.
That's my leader!
- No more leaders!
- No!
- Death to all of them!
- Yeah!
You're totally crazy!
- Death to exploiters!
- Yeah!
- Death to all leaders!
- Yeah!
- Death to the minister!
- Yeah!
Death to...
No, not death.
Long live the revolution!
And death to congress!
- You done?
- I'm done.
- Now come with me.
- Where?
Downtown, so you can keep bad-mouthing the government and congress.
Move it!
I didn't bad-mouth the government.
I assure you that I'm part...
- Move it!
- One moment!
Commander.
What?
Who are you talking to, sir?
To you, my friend.
- It's just that...
- Tell me, commander.
It's just that I'm...
I'm not a commander.
Not yet?
No, not yet.
You sure look like a commander, man.
Besides... you deserve to be one.
Thank you, sir.
And that's how it goes.
Hardly anyone is what they seem.
Me, for instance.
- I seem like a congressman, right?
- Sure do.
Well, you know how things are.
I'm not a congressman.
What?
I'm not a congressman.
Yet.
You're coming too, for mocking the authorities.
- What authority?
- Please, sir.
- You shut up.
- I'm the authority.
- Oh yeah?
Hang a sign around your neck, pal.
Nobody insults me!
Move it!
First let's have a little chat.
Come on.
No.
No, Mundito!
Let me go!
Let...!
What's wrong, Dorita?
Give me a minute.
How awful!
Well, professor, I'm off.
My wife must be waiting for me.
Want a ride?
You too, Dorita.
No, thank you.
It's already past five.
- I'll be seeing you, then.
- Bye, congressman.
It was a pleasure.
- At your service.
- See you, professor.
Dorita, I'll go pay my tab.
Get mine too, okay?
Bring the bill!
Staying, fatso?
- It's up to her.
- Some other time.
- Why not now?
- Well...
You heard her.
Let's go.
Don't be mad, but I want to start off this year differently.
See you Saturday.
It's only 708 pesos, sir.
"Only"?
I can't get a discount?
- And a New Year's tip?
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, sir.
- Bye, Pepsi.
Consider me a friend.
- Thank you.
Tell her bye for me.
I don't want to interrupt.
Sure.
And Heels?
- At the funeral parlor.
Won't be long.
- Tell her I said bye too.
Hey, Don Pepe.
How's the year starting off?
Like all the others:
lots of work and little profit.
You're like the Missus now.
Don't complain.
Anyway, what's it to me?
It's her money.
Want one last drink?
Okay, but so I don't mix drinks:
half tequila, half cognac.
Really, man, those broads are so strange.
You know what, Juan?
Now I don't think they're so strange.
Because...
Come on, let's go.
How strange.
I've gotten drunk three times tonight, and each time I lost my buzz.
- Why might that be?
- No.
- Where's Bridge?
- He said he'd come back.
- You'll wait for him, right?
- I don't know.
He said he had a little thing to handle.
I know what, but I won't tell.
Hey, do you love him?
- Please!
- Wait!
It hurts, doesn't it?
But that pain is nice and good.
Let's talk about something else.
Want me to tell you about my life?
If you want.
Like I told you, I never met my parents.
They left me at the orphanage soon after I was born.
- But I told you that, right?
- Yes.
- AlwaysAlive...
- Yes?
Tonight you've told me three different stories of your life.
Three stories?
Which one's true?
After you've lived for so many years and so many centuries, who even knows what the truth is?
Three stories...
Maybe they're all true.
Maybe none are.
I don't think it matters.
Get in here!
- I said get in here!
- No, please.
I don't want to.
You want them to beat you up again?
Let me go.
- I'm not that drunk.
Stop.
- Come in.
- Want to vent?
- No.
This couldn't be more agonizing or more sordid.
None of my friends, or these women can look their parents in the eye.
Or I am different?
Why this terrible need to hate...
and to disappear?
- I'm obsessed with doing evil.
- Evil?
To drown out my tenderness, and this shame and this anger.
I feel like crying, like when I was a child.
Then cry.
Cry.
Like how I cried that day my father shouted at my mother that he didn't love her, that he had never loved her.
That he only married her because I was on the way.
That he hated me too.
Don't think about that now.
I'd almost forgotten.
Afterward, my mother held me and cried a lot.
But those tears...
Yes, I understand now!
They weren't out of love for me.
They were out of rage and jealousy.
Out of hatred for him!
And fear too.
Fear?
Why?
Could she also be to blame?
No!
Not her!
Not my mother!
But my God!
To blame for what?
No!
Bobby was killed!
He's dead!
Raquel!
Why'd you run away?
I don't know.
Where were you?
I'm free now.
Free?
From what?
Everything tying me down...
and keeping me from loving you.
I wish I could be too.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm scared, Bridge.
Of loving me?
Of you loving me.
Why?
Why?
What did you have in mind?
To take you away with me.
- Where?
- Far away.
Today, if you want.
- Bridge...
- Yes?
I can't go away with you.
Why?
Hold me!
Tighter!
Tighter.
Raquel!
- What were you going to do?
- The worst thing, but God stopped me.
I'm sick, with no hope for a cure.
- Are you sure?
- Completely.
I only have five or six months left.
- What is it, Raquel?
What is it?
- A tumor in my head.
I was born with it.
- Five or six months?
- Yes.
We'll go to my town, okay?
I haven't been there in many years.
- I'll take you to my house.
It's humble but...
- No, no, please!
But I'm sicker than you.
I'm rotten inside sick from every type of vice:
cowardice, lies...
But you must accept me as I am, since love means accepting everything.
Everything, understand?
Everything.
So... you'll love me as I am?
As you are.
Every hour... and every minute from this sunrise on.
Look at the new day.
Look at how a new day is born.
Our day.
Bye, girls.
Happy New Year.
Bye, girl.
Same to you.
- Bye, Dorita!
- See you, Dorita!
Bye, Dorana!
Bye, Chipotle.
Good-bye, my dear professor.
See you next year.
He'll have nightmares when his wife gets here.
Bye, AlwaysAlive.
And thanks.
You're leaving together?
Yes.
Together.
- You have no money, right?
- Yeah.
Love is the best thing in life.
But money is the lifeblood of the world.
Give me your hand.
Here.
You can get 10,000 for it at least.
Here's the receipt.
It's very old, but it'll do.
I like things to be in order.
- But...
- But, AlwaysAlive...
Don't let them hear.
They'd laugh at me.
See you soon, AlwaysAlive.
- See you, AlwaysAlive.
- No.
Not "see you".
Good-bye, Bridge.
See you tonight, Always.
See you tonight.
You still owe 20 pesos.
Did you discount my tokens?
It was 89.50's worth.
But all the drinks were for you.
Can't I earn tokens on my own drink orders?
All right.
Rosa, will you stay for a bit?
I'm gonna go say hi to a friend.
Watch the register.
I won't be long.
Good morning, Cholita.
What?
Good morning, Doña Concha.
Oh, there's Pancho!
Sleeping, the poor thing.
I was afraid he'd be gone.
I'm late today.
A child of ours is sick, and you know what that's like.
Yeah.
- Did everyone have fun?
- I think so.
A little.
And you're still up?
You're so kind.
Me?
Taking care of him, like last year.
Remember?
Right.
- Want me to wake him up?
- No.
Let him sleep for a bit.
I won't make it to 6:00 mass.
By the time I got him to our door...
even though we're close... and as it's almost 6:00...
I'll go to the 6:30 mass.
Do you want a... a soda?
No.
Thank you, but I don't eat between meals.
All right.
You have a daughter here, right?
Me?
Sure, I thought you did.
It must be very hard at your age to stay up all night.
- I'm younger than you and I can't.
- Well, yes.
It's hard.
But we mothers will do anything for our children.
- He give you much trouble?
- No, he didn't.
Would you believe that, by June, I'm already wishing it were December?
Why, Conchita?
For the first few months, he's very calm.
In January and February, even affectionate.
After June, he starts to get restless.
And by November...!
Oh, Cholita!
By November...
What terrible moods I have to bear.
You laugh, but if you only knew...
You must be a widow, right?
A widow?
Yes, I'm a widow.
Lucky you!
What?
I meant... lucky you for having had a husband with a better temper, right?
Of course, Conchita.
That's why I'm even glad to come get him every New Year's.
I know that tomorrow he'll buy us pastries.
He's waking up.
Don't tell him we talked.
He's very touchy.
Don't worry, Conchita.
Pancho?
Panchito?
- I'm here now.
- What?
Dorita?
Oh, it's you.
I just got here.
Come on, let's go.
The children will be up soon.
The children!
The children!
Want help?
The two of us can carry him.
No, but thank you.
What would people say?
If they see him leave with one woman, okay.
But with two?
Come on, Panchito.
Let's go.
Everyone's gone?
Everyone, except Cholita, who stayed to look after you like last year.
- Thank her.
- "Cholita"?
AlwaysAlive!
Don't mind him.
When he's like this, he likes to give people odd names.
Last year he called me Pepsi-Cola.
How funny, right?
What's wrong?
It's this life.
Sometimes it feels like that game that spins and spins, and never stops.
Roulette?
Yes.
But it's nice after all, isn't it?
It's... it's unfair.
All the good ones suffer.
They die, but we keep on living.
So you think that to be good, you have to be like other women, eh?
Get married, be faithful...
and have children.
Be quiet, be quiet.
Don't you want a child?
Wait!
Tell me what's wrong, as if I were your mother.
No... no.
Are you ashamed?
Of what?
Of the thought that I could be your mother.
No, not that.
Why should I be ashamed of that?
Then... why does the thought of having a child scare you?
Aren't we all the same?
Leave me alone!
You're pregnant, right?
And that's why you're crying.
Yes that's why.
Because I shouldn't have it.
Why not?
You have to ask?
How can I have a child...
if I don't even know whose it is?
What does that matter?
It's yours, isn't it?
Didn't you ever want to have it?
Many times... when I was alone but never when I was with a man.
- That's not what counts!
- I'm going, AlwaysAlive.
- Just wait!
I also know about that.
I also killed my child!
AlwaysAlive!
It's not just another of my stories.
I killed my child...
because I felt what you feel:
That it had no father.
That I didn't have the right.
I don't have the right!
I live in the street, the filth!
Not even alley-cats live like I do!
There's no good in me or the willpower to change my life, or even the desire to!
Because today I'm crying and in despair but tomorrow, I'll love life more.
Even if now I think I could have the child... and love them... and care for them,... maybe if they were born...
I'd beat them... or abandon them like so many others do.
And why should the child pay?
Tell me one thing.
Is this your first time?
My first.
But I always knew what I'd do when that day came.
What I will do!
Haven't you thought of what your child would want?
What?
Haven't you thought of how life could be nice, grand, and clean for them?
If our mothers were respectable, why can't our children be so as well?
And another thing:
Listen closely.
One day, a priest told me that I could take communion.
I laughed so hard!
How could I take communion being what I am?
"With God by your side," he said, "you'll be less bad."
"But I'll keep sinning," I told him.
You know what he said?
No.
"Leave it to Him."
I couldn't have children after that one.
That child's memory has haunted me all my life.
That's why I'm telling you:
If we have nothing... except God we must seek shelter in Him.
May your child be born!
May they live, may they love.
Whether they're good or bad, sick or healthy... that leave that to Him.
All right.
Now go to mass, and say one in my name because I think I'll be at this all day long.
You're so kind, AlwaysAlive.
Now that's twice I've heard that today.
Eventually I'll believe it, eh?
Go on, go.
What about Don Pepe?
He told me to watch the register.
I'll watch it.
Go, don't worry.
Go on, or you'll be late.
See you tonight.
See you tonight.
Hey!
Are you happy now?
Yes, I think so.
Eighty-nine fifty.
Well, to each their own life.
Happy New Year, Alka-Seltzer!
Happy New Year, AlwaysAlive.
- Staying for a bit?
- Yes.
Watch the register!
Don Pepe won't be long.
Okay.
- Happy New Year, AlwaysAlive.
- Happy New Year, Minute.
Want to go get a tequila at The Screw?
Just one?
How about forty!
Drunk on tequila...
Alka-Seltzer for your hangover.
Aspirin with caffeine!
Alka-Seltzer!

Moderato cantabile.
- What does that mean?
- I've forgotten.
Is that so?
- He's so stubborn, Mrs Desbarèdes.
- Indeed.
I told you last time and the time before.
You just don't want to tell us.
For the 100th time...
Moderato cantabile means moderate and melodic.
Moderate and melodic.
Right.
Now play.
What are you waiting for?
Do you want to say something?
Say it, then.
- The sonatina.
- So?
I don't like it.
- What's wrong?
It's so pretty.
- It's too difficult.
- Did you just figure that out?
- Yes.
- Yes, who?
- Yes, Miss Giraud.
Play it.
See this, Mrs Desbarèdes?
Terrible.
As stubborn as a goat.
- Alas, in this part of town...
- What is it?
- I'm waiting.
- Who screamed?
Your sonatina...
Go on.
Play.
And yet... see?
If only he wanted.
What's happening?
Start again.
Remember, moderato cantabile.
- Think of a lullaby.
- I never sing to him.
Tonight he'll ask me to, and he'll ask so nicely I won't be able to resist him.
In B flat.
You always forget.
Why did you stop?
- To watch.
- Keep playing.
Something serious must have happened.
Come and see!
We may as well stop for today.
But next time he'll have to know the first movement perfectly.
More cars are coming.
Move back!
Let us in!
Step back!
Stay right here.
I'll be back.
Stay here.
A beautiful woman...
He killed her.
What will happen now?
What is it?
- It wasn't him who screamed.
- No.
Don't look.
You should try to remember.
Moderato means moderate.
It's nearly the same.
And cantabile means melodic.
It's easy.
- And you, didn't you hear anything?
- No.
But I understand you were nearby.
You know,
Miss Giraud's house is located very close to that café.
I must tell you that the piano lesson was cut short today.
With all that commotion.
By the way...
I have to say Pierre plays his sonatina almost perfectly.
Miss Giraud told me again today, it's not that he lacks musical talent but he lacks good will.
Please...
I'm sorry.
What would you like?
A glass of wine.
And for the child?
Nothing.
He's already had a snack.
Nice day.
I was thirsty.
And in fact, I'll have another one.
- I was just walking past.
- Nice day for a walk.
Yesterday I was at Miss Giraud's.
I recognise you.
Yes.
Miss Giraud teaches my son the piano.
May I?
Thank you but I'm not used to this.
She screamed so loudly that it's natural to be curious, isn't it?
Naturally.
- Therefore I had to come.
- You were around when it happened.
I couldn't see from Miss Giraud's window.
All the more reason to come here.
Don't you think?
I think so.
But we don't know much about it.
- Do you mean we don't know why?
- Right.
We don't know why.
Not yet anyway.
Do you know why she screamed yesterday?
Go and play.
What's certain is that they were having a relationship.
Yes, a love story.
We assume so.
Maybe he had heartache.
That's what they call it in magazines... "heartache".
Just this once.
Right.
You were saying?
Oh...
You were walking past.
Yes.
I take my child for a walk every day.
- Around here?
- I usually go to the Arcy forest.
Or to a park.
Or to the river bank.
Something new must happen around here every day.
- I doubt it.
- Don't you think so?
In reality I don't have an opinion.
Maybe.
But one day something catches your attention more than usual.
I shouldn't have drunk so much wine.
Hey, how are you?
How are things?
Since last night, I haven't stopped thinking about it.
Since the piano lesson.
I couldn't stop myself coming here today.
It doesn't matter.
You are Mrs Desbarèdes, wife of the factory's owner.
You live on Boulevard de la Mer.
Yes, sir.
We want so much for them, we don't know how to do it or where to start.
- Do you have children, sir?
- No.
You can't imagine how happy we want them to be.
As if it were possible.
I've seen you so often walking on the quay...
It's difficult to believe you're here now.
Look, it's still daylight.
The days are getting longer.
Do you work in this town, sir?
At the Desbarèdes factory like everyone else.
I must go home.
If you come back,
I'll try to get some information about that story.
I'll tell you.
Funny how sometimes you just don't want to go home.
Raise your head.
Sometimes I think I invented you, that none of this is real.
Let's go for a walk.
- Where to?
- All around here.
Come.
- Did you get any more news?
- Nothing.
Aren't you working today, Mr Chauvin?
Why aren't you talking?
No reason.
Sometimes one doesn't feel like talking.
When did we first take the ferry?
Was I little?
Yes, you were very, very tiny.
You can't remember.
I remember things.
- What, sweetheart?
- Things.
Once there were daffodils and Dad.
We were all together.
How old was I?
Daffodils bloom every year.
I don't know.
Remember, you had a blue dress with things on it.
What else?
I fell and hurt my knee.
- You were upset.
- Yes, hold on...
Oh, you were very little.
- And you remember all that?
- Yes, everything.
Wait, you were...
You were four.
Tell me stories of when I was little.
Well, when you were little...
- Aren't you cross with me?
- No.
The trouble is it's hard for a woman to find an excuse to go into a café.
Today I wasn't able to find one.
No even the cold outside, not even thirst.
Forgive me, sir...
Heard any news since yesterday?
You should have heard the way she screamed.
A very long, very high pitch.
It stopped as it was at its strongest.
- Then it started again slowly.
- I was there.
Just once more, I think.
I may have screamed like that once.
When I had my child.
If you knew how much I screamed...
I know everything, almost everything.
Did you hear something more?
They'd met exactly six months earlier.
Six months.
- Was their encounter an accident?
- An accident.
He used to walk to work past her house every day.
She could see him.
That's how it all began between them.
She used to look out the window early in the morning.
He could see her too.
She was a woman who often looked at men in the morning.
On their way to work at the arsenal.
But it's only after she noticed him that she realised how bored she was.
Bored for a long time, bored watching the other men.
While the other women in town were still asleep.
How did they start talking to each other?
You see, she was living in a house... surrounded by a big garden and a metal fence.
In the evening, especially at this time of year, her child and her husband asleep, she'd go for a stroll.
She'd walk to the fence and look at the street.
She'd walk randomly...
She had trouble sleeping.
Her neighbourhood was very quiet, especially in the evening.
Just a few strollers, a bicycle...
That's all.
Who knows where they were coming from.
Was it a routine, her having to go out to the garden at night?
Yes, a routine.
Did she ever scream?
No, she never screamed.
One evening, he saw her in the garden.
So he came back.
He came back, and back again.
And one day he stopped.
That was it.
And it happened precisely in this town.
It's hard to believe.
It started between them like all stories do.
And then?
Then?
Then, I don't think anyone can tell.
Look, summer's almost here.
- No.
- Yes, it is.
No.
Summer never comes in this region.
It's always windy.
Have you been living here long?
One year.
For me it's been eight years.
- Since you got married?
- Yes.
If I were you, I'd leave.
I'd move to a city without trees, without wind.
There's always wind here.
Except for two or three days a year.
Most birds here are seagulls found exhausted after a storm.
And after the storm they scream as if they'd been slaughtered.
On the estuary.
They prevent you sleeping.
No.
I'd leave this place.
If I were you I'd leave.
The first time I saw you was last year at the end of May.
You were having a party for the staff, as happens every year.
You were looking at us with kindness... and indifference.
You were resting against a large piano.
You were wearing a black dress and had a magnolia between your breasts.
You were looking out at the park, waiting for us to leave.
You wouldn't stop crushing that flower.
My name is Chauvin.
I must go home.
Can I meet you again?
That won't be easy.
I have a very fixed schedule.
But before going I would have liked to know one last detail, even if you're not too sure.
Why did he finally kill her?
I don't know.
That, I don't know.
But what you do reckon?
I think she asked him to kill her.
He didn't have any choice.
What's up?
I don't know.
My little darling.
- Can we go again?
- Where?
- Over there.
- Perhaps.
I'd like that.
I told my friend you were going to buy me a red boat with an engine.
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, I heard you.
A red boat with an engine.
Look at that!
Look how tall you are now.
You've grown up a lot.
It's good.
Take off the handcuffs.
Come closer.
Come on!
Do you recognise this?
How were you positioned?
Lie down as you did then.
Mr Chauvin...
Aren't you going to Bordeaux tonight?
No, not tonight.
I'm not used to not being at home at this time of day.
What's with me?
What's with me today?
- Everyone in town will know you and I...
- Everyone already does.
I went past your house last night.
The night was bright, so I could see your garden clearly.
I stayed there a long time.
At the first floor on the right-hand side two windows were still lit up.
It's my bedroom.
I couldn't sleep.
Neither could I.
I promised myself I'd stop coming.
And here I am.
I promised myself I'd stop seeing you too.
I feel tired.
Tired... like never before.
You said "Like never before".
Yes.
So you promised to never come again?
I promised myself I'd try.
It's mainly because of that murder, you see.
Did you read the morning paper?
Yes.
- So you know...
- That you made it all up?
Not all of it.
I always knew, always, all those years,
in the night, during the day...
I've kept thinking that everything, everything is possible.
Please...
I'd like to know a little more about it.
Even if you're not too sure about things.
Even if you have to make it up.
You know...
They used to meet in an abandoned house.
By the sea.
Really?
It's sheltered from the wind and it's warm there in summer.
The first time they met it was a very hot summer.
Towards the end he quit his job.
They'd meet almost every day.
That house felt like their own.
They didn't know before going there that it would be the end so soon.
No, they didn't know.
Sorry.
Do you like other people's stories as much?
Yes.
You have no idea.
How about your own story?
Same thing.
If someone told it to me.
So?
The time came that, when looking at her, he didn't feel quite the same way.
To him she had ceased to be beautiful, young...
Old, or dead...
I think it only happened very recently that he wanted her dead.
You tell stories so well.
STRANGLED BY HER LOVER
It was with him that...
It was with him... that she understood what she really was.
For instance...
A bitch.
Time came when he understood that he was not able to touch her anywhere...
But here, right?
Here, yes.
I want you to go.
The sonatina.
Diabelli's lovely sonatina.
Play it.
What's the measure for that lovely sonatina?
Tell us.
How many beats in a measure?
Three beats?
Four beats?
Tell me.
Moderate and melodic.
He must be doing it on purpose.
Four beats.
Repeat.
I'm waiting.
- Maybe he didn't hear you.
- He heard perfectly.
You'll never accept that he's doing it on purpose.
My darling, you know the answer.
- Four beats.
- See?
He knew it.
Maybe he'd forgotten it.
One day he'll know it.
Even if he doesn't want it, he'll just know it.
You should be ashamed, Mrs Desbarèdes.
I hear that a lot.
Warm-ups.
Ten minutes.
First in C major.
That will teach you to listen.
Again.
I said for ten minutes.
Again.
Why?
I can't believe this.
Because I said so.
And insolent, to top it all!
In G major.
Three times, go on.
Didn't you hear?
I said three times.
Did you hear, my darling?
I'm sure you did.
Strange how children can make you become wicked.
Good for his character and his fingers.
Right.
You know, I'm not sure I can continue teaching him.
I'll explain to him that he must obey.
But you say that every time.
There's nothing to explain.
The choice isn't up to him.
That's called education.
Now play the sonatina.
One, two, three, four...
Let's go.
What happens to those deer?
They're caught in very large nets and taken to other forests.
But where do they come from?
I've told you before.
I tell you every time we come.
- Tell me again.
- So this is how it goes...
The deer come from a different region.
They all cross the forest on the same night.
All together on the same night.
- Where do they come from?
- From over there, far away.
- And where do they go?
- To Germany, a country very far away.
- Why?
- That, no one knows.
If they travel at night, they must be afraid of something.
Are you sure no one knows why?
I'd like you to tell me.
No one knows.
I can't tell you.
They're not taken to other forests!
They're killed but you won't tell me!
I swear it's not that.
I swear.
Pierre...
Pierre!
Let's go home, my darling.
Look, we're lost.
Ah, yes, we are!
I'm late.
Those piano lessons take for ever.
Afterwards we went to the Arcy forest.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, madam.
A glass of wine.
Please.
Thank you.
So we were saying...
Thank you.
You came back.
I think I'm in love with you.
That's why.
But I'm never sure about what I say.
I'm never sure of anything.
Maybe he wanted to kill her very early on.
From the moment he first saw her.
We may have been wrong.
Perhaps... before meeting you... did I ignore who I was?
Go away.
I think long periods of happiness aren't for me.
It suits me more to spend very short lengths of time with certain men.
I only figured that out a few days ago.
After I met you.
But...
There's a dinner party at my house tonight.
I'm expected to attend.
But maybe there's no point.
For once.
I said maybe there's no point.
There's no point in you staying here either.
The weather is so nice tonight.
We could meet again.
At whatever time you want after dinner.
Wherever you want.
I think it's no longer possible.
For a short time only.
Here, if you want.
How are Pierre's lessons going?
Anne didn't hear you.
True.
We were wondering how your son's lessons are going.
Forgive me.
At the moment, he's working on a sonatina by Diabelli.
Good.
A sonatina, already?
Already, yes.
Miss Giraud, who also teaches my son, told me this story.
He can't remember what moderato cantabile means.
No, he can't.
The little darling, he's so little, how could he?
It's difficult.
He must already be asleep.
Will we get to see him?
He's already asleep.
No, thank you.
I really couldn't.
Thank you.
Delicious.
Could it be the magnolia's strong perfume?
I'm used to these flowers.
I'm fine.
- Are you unwell, Mrs Desbarèdes?
- No.
Sometimes I'm just not hungry.
Anne didn't hear you.
We're going to a secluded house at the seaside.
A secluded house at the seaside.
The beach?
A lot of fun for the children.
The little darling must be very happy.
Yes.
Anne...
Anne...
What shall I tell them?
That I'm going mad.
Mr Chauvin, I was about to close.
I'm sorry, but I must see Mrs Desbarèdes.
We can't meet anywhere but here.
Anybody here?
Why didn't you answer?
I was waiting for you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
For ever?
Yes, for ever.
Because of me?
- Of us?
- Yes, because of you.
I knew it was impossible.
I never thought it would happen so fast.
If I stayed you wouldn't be able to walk your son in town.
No.
I couldn't have carried on.
Not even to his piano lessons.
I should have accepted that someone else can take my son there.
Instead of me.
No.
Everyone's watching me...
It's unbelievable.
I know.
I approve of them watching you.
I wish you never stopped talking.
We weren't able to love each other.
That's how things must be sometimes.
It's been seven days.
Seven nights.
Seven nights, true.
Come closer for a moment.
Maybe one minute.
And we'll manage.
I'll never be able to talk to anybody else.
You will.
One day you'll speak like this to a child or whoever.
On a nice day you'll say "It's a nice day".
You'll want to share that with someone.
- It will happen again.
- No!
That's what you want to believe.
It doesn't matter.
We have little time left.
The day will break soon.
I'm scared...
I'm scared.
I'm scared!
I wish you were dead.
Now I am.
Moderato Cantabile Peter Brook, 1960
SEVEN DAYS...
SEVEN NIGHTS
And now, the Diabelli.
Read what the score says.
Moderato cantabile.
- What does that mean?
- I've forgotten.
Is that so?
- He's so stubborn, Mrs Desbarèdes.
- Indeed.
I told you last time and the time before.
You just don't want to tell us.
For the 100th time...
Moderato cantabile means moderate and melodic.
Moderate and melodic.
Right.
Now play.
What are you waiting for?
Do you want to say something?
Say it, then.
- The sonatina.
- So?
I don't like it.
- What's wrong?
It's so pretty.
- It's too difficult.
- Did you just figure that out?
- Yes.
- Yes, who?
- Yes, Miss Giraud.
Play it.
See this, Mrs Desbarèdes?
Terrible.
As stubborn as a goat.
- Alas, in this part of town...
- What is it?
- I'm waiting.
- Who screamed?
Your sonatina...
Go on.
Play.
And yet... see?
If only he wanted.
What's happening?
Start again.
Remember, moderato cantabile.
- Think of a lullaby.
- I never sing to him.
Tonight he'll ask me to, and he'll ask so nicely I won't be able to resist him.
In B flat.
You always forget.

But next time he'll have to know the first movement perfectly.

Stay right here.
I'll be back.
Stay here.
A beautiful woman...
He killed her.
What will happen now?
What is it?
- It wasn't him who screamed.
- No.
Don't look.
You should try to remember.
Moderato means moderate.

Look, summer's almost here.

No.

It's always windy.
Have you been living here long?
One year.
For me it's been eight years.
- Since you got married?
- Yes.
If I were you, I'd leave.

I think she asked him to kill her.
He didn't have any choice.
What's up?
I don't know.
My little darling.
- Can we go again?
- Where?
- Over there.
- Perhaps.
I'd like that.
I told my friend you were going to buy me a red boat with an engine.
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, I heard you.
A red boat with an engine.
Look at that!
Look how tall you are now.
You've grown up a lot.
It's good.
Take off the handcuffs.
Come closer.
Come on!
Do you recognise this?
How were you positioned?
Lie down as you did then.
Mr Chauvin...
Aren't you going to Bordeaux tonight?
No, not tonight.
I'm not used to not being at home at this time of day.
What's with me?
What's with me today?
- Everyone in town will know you and I...
- Everyone already does.
I went past your house last night.
The night was bright, so I could see your garden clearly.
I stayed there a long time.
At the first floor on the right-hand side two windows were still lit up.
It's my bedroom.
I couldn't sleep.
Neither could I.
I promised myself I'd stop coming.
And here I am.
I promised myself I'd stop seeing you too.
I feel tired.
Tired... like never before.
You said "Like never before."
Yes.
So you promised to never come again?
I promised myself I'd try.
It's mainly because of that murder, you see.
Did you read the morning paper?
Yes.
- So you know...
- That you made it all up?
Not all of it.
I always knew, always, all those years,
in the night, during the day...
I've kept thinking that everything, everything is possible.
Please...
I'd like to know a little more about it.
Even if you're not too sure about things.
Even if you have to make it up.
You know...
They used to meet in an abandoned house.
By the sea.
Really?
It's sheltered from the wind and it's warm there in summer.
The first time they met it was a very hot summer.
Towards the end he quit his job.
They'd meet almost every day.
That house felt like their own.
They didn't know before going there that it would be the end so soon.
No, they didn't know.
Sorry.
Do you like other people's stories as much?
Yes.
You have no idea.
How about your own story?
Same thing.
If someone told it to me.
So?
The time came that, when looking at her, he didn't feel quite the same way.
To him she had ceased to be beautiful, young...
Old, or dead...
I think it only happened very recently that he wanted her dead.
You tell stories so well.
STRANGLED BY HER LOVER
It was with him that...
It was with him... that she understood what she really was.
For instance...
A bitch.
Time came when he understood that he was not able to touch her anywhere...
But here, right?
Here, yes.
I want you to go.
The sonatina.
Diabelli's lovely sonatina.
Play it.
What's the measure for that lovely sonatina?
Tell us.
How many beats in a measure?
Three beats?
Four beats?
Tell me.
Moderate and melodic.
He must be doing it on purpose.
Four beats.
Repeat.
I'm waiting.
- Maybe he didn't hear you.
- He heard perfectly.
You'll never accept that he's doing it on purpose.
My darling, you know the answer.
- Four beats.
- See?
He knew it.
Maybe he'd forgotten it.
One day he'll know it.
Even if he doesn't want it, he'll just know it.
You should be ashamed, Mrs Desbarèdes.
I hear that a lot.
Warm-ups.
Ten minutes.
First in C major.
That will teach you to listen.
Again.
I said for ten minutes.
Again.
Why?
I can't believe this.
Because I said so.
And insolent, to top it all!
In G major.
Three times, go on.
Didn't you hear?
I said three times.
Did you hear, my darling?
I'm sure you did.
Strange how children can make you become wicked.
Good for his character and his fingers.
Right.
You know, I'm not sure I can continue teaching him.
I'll explain to him that he must obey.
But you say that every time.
There's nothing to explain.
The choice isn't up to him.
That's called education.
Now play the sonatina.
One, two, three, four...
Let's go.
What happens to those deer?
They're caught in very large nets and taken to other forests.
But where do they come from?
I've told you before.
I tell you every time we come.
- Tell me again.
- So this is how it goes...
The deer come from a different region.
They all cross the forest on the same night.
All together on the same night.
- Where do they come from?
- From over there, far away.
- And where do they go?
- To Germany, a country very far away.
- Why?
- That, no one knows.
If they travel at night, they must be afraid of something.
Are you sure no one knows why?
I'd like you to tell me.
No one knows.
I can't tell you.
They're not taken to other forests!
They're killed but you won't tell me!
I swear it's not that.
I swear.
Pierre...
Pierre!
Let's go home, my darling.
Look, we're lost.
Ah, yes, we are!
I'm late.
Those piano lessons take for ever.
Afterwards we went to the Arcy forest.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, madam.
A glass of wine.
Please.
Thank you.
So we were saying...
Thank you.
You came back.
I think I'm in love with you.
That's why.
But I'm never sure about what I say.
I'm never sure of anything.
Maybe he wanted to kill her very early on.
From the moment he first saw her.
We may have been wrong.
Perhaps... before meeting you... did I ignore who I was?
Go away.
I think long periods of happiness aren't for me.
It suits me more to spend very short lengths of time with certain men.
I only figured that out a few days ago.
After I met you.
But...
There's a dinner party at my house tonight.
I'm expected to attend.
But maybe there's no point.
For once.
I said maybe there's no point.
There's no point in you staying here either.
The weather is so nice tonight.
We could meet again.
At whatever time you want after dinner.
Wherever you want.
I think it's no longer possible.
For a short time only.
Here, if you want.
How are Pierre's lessons going?
Anne didn't hear you.
True.
We were wondering how your son's lessons are going.
Forgive me.
At the moment, he's working on a sonatina by Diabelli.
Good.
A sonatina, already?
Already, yes.
Miss Giraud, who also teaches my son, told me this story.
He can't remember what moderato cantabile means.
No, he can't.
The little darling, he's so little, how could he?
It's difficult.
He must already be asleep.
Will we get to see him?
He's already asleep.
No, thank you.
I really couldn't.
Thank you.
Delicious.
Could it be the magnolia's strong perfume?
I'm used to these flowers.
I'm fine.
- Are you unwell, Mrs Desbarèdes?
- No.
Sometimes I'm just not hungry.
Anne didn't hear you.
We're going to a secluded house at the seaside.
A secluded house at the seaside.
The beach?
A lot of fun for the children.
The little darling must be very happy.
Yes.
Anne...
Anne...
What shall I tell them?
That I'm going mad.
Mr Chauvin, I was about to close.
I'm sorry, but I must see Mrs Desbarèdes.
We can't meet anywhere but here.
Anybody here?
Why didn't you answer?
I was waiting for you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
For ever?
Yes, for ever.
Because of me?
- Of us?
- Yes, because of you.
I knew it was impossible.
I never thought it would happen so fast.
If I stayed you wouldn't be able to walk your son in town.
No.
I couldn't have carried on.
Not even to his piano lessons.
I should have accepted that someone else can take my son there.
Instead of me.
No.
Everyone's watching me...
It's unbelievable.
I know.
I approve of them watching you.
I wish you never stopped talking.
We weren't able to love each other.
That's how things must be sometimes.
It's been seven days.
Seven nights.
Seven nights, true.
Come closer for a moment.
Maybe one minute.
And we'll manage.
I'll never be able to talk to anybody else.
You will.
One day you'll speak like this to a child or whoever.
On a nice day you'll say "It's a nice day."
You'll want to share that with someone.
- It will happen again.
- No!
That's what you want to believe.
It doesn't matter.
We have little time left.
The day will break soon.
I'm scared...
I'm scared.
I'm scared!
I wish you were dead.
Now I am.
Subtitles:
AusMinx 2009 for KARAGARGA
The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.
Here, friend, it's all alive on the inside.
Step right up, people.
There we go.
It's new, it's different, it's all alive.
See the fabulous Little Egypt, who once danced for the Queen of England.
Little Egypt, the shimmy dancer.
Now, in all confidence, folks, for those of you who have never seen the female figure in delicious movement from head to toe, you can see it here for only 25 cents, one quarter of a dollar, a two-bit piece
to see the most delectable package of pulchritude...
Oh, ain't this the beatingest dad-gum thing you ever seen?
Virginia City's really come of age, now that the carnival circuit has hit us.
Oh, I can't stand to look at it.
Supposing he were to miss.
Ah, he ain't gonna miss.
You don't look very scared, Jennifer.
What's there to be scared of?
I'd give anything in the world to change places with that girl up there.
Well, Adam, I guess you and I better get on our way.
We've been here longer than we planned.
Harriet, Jennifer, good night.
Joe, you promised Mr. Beale faithfully you'd get the girls
- home by 10:00 tonight.
- Right.
Mr. Cartwright, please.
Do you have to remind me?
Don't worry, Pa, I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.
- Sure, Pa, but who's gonna keep an eye on him?
That's two bits, 25 cents...
Oh, that's easy, uh, Hoss will.
...the most delectable package of pulchritude...
Isn't that right, Hoss?
Huh?
I mean, sir?
He'll do fine, Pa; ask no more.
You're going to see this charming little lady move every muscle in her body...
Good night, girls.
Good night, Hoss.
- Joe.
- Good night, Pa.
- Good night.
- Night, Pa.
Hey.
Ain't this the beatingest dad-burned thing you ever seen, Joe?
Boy, you're just not kidding.
Looking at anything special, Gerner?
That girl, the redhead...
she looks familiar.
Hey, you reckon what we ought to take in first?
How 'bout the mystic tent?
- Like to have my fortune told.
- All right.
That's what I'd like to hear about.
Wouldn't you, Harriet?
- Well, not if it's any bad news, I wouldn't.
- Come on, let's go.
She's been plastered all over the front pages of the San Francisco paper for the past couple of months.
That's Joshua Beale's daughter.
Joshua Beale?
Mm-hmm.
The silver king.
He's one of the richest men in the world.
Stop dreaming, Gerner.
...the big show begins.
The most electrifying tent act ever to appear on the midway, west of the Mississippi.
Just once in my life,
I'd like to get my hands on some real money.
What do you suppose Beale figures that daughter's worth to him?
More money than we'll ever see, Gerner.
Hey, Hoss.
You gonna let this guy read your future?
I don't know.
I might just take him on.
Ever since that old Piute squaw read my palm and told me I was gonna be taking that long trip,
I-I been plumb off my feed bag.
I can't eat but five or six meals.
Hey!
Now, if one of you will give to my assistant some personal object.
Don't be afraid, ladies and gentlemen.
Nothing will happen to it.
If you please, some personal object.
Are you ready, Mr. Wizard?
I am ready.
Then can you tell me what I'm holding in my hand?
I see a round object... of precious metal.
I hear a strange sound.
A very strange sound.
I believe it is... a gold pocket watch.
Joe, how do you reckon he does that?
Beats the heck out of me.
You think it's some sort of trick?
Of course it's a trick.
How do you know?
Well, I just...
Silence!
And now I will bring to you one of the most astounding disappearance acts in the annals of all magic.
And tonight, just to prove to you that this is truly an outstanding and remarkable feat, instead of using my regular assistant,
I shall ask one of you to assist me.
Is there a young lady in the audience who would like to disappear for a few minutes?
I assure you, it's a thrill that you have never realized before.
I'd like to try.
- Jennifer!
- Hey, Jenny!
You know what your pa said about leaving Little Joe's sight.
He didn't say anything about this.
And besides, this will be fun.
Yeah, but...
if-if you disappear, that's gonna be leaving his sight, ain't it?
Jennifer, sit down!
Everybody's looking at you!
Hey, Joe, don't you think you ought to stop her?
Might as well let her go ahead.
It's just a trick.
It seems a shame to make such a pretty young lady disappear.
Don't worry, young man,
I'll have her back to you soon enough.
Now, you see, ladies and gentlemen, that this is an ordinary wardrobe trunk.
Young lady.
Where am I?
Backstage.
And I open it.
Why is she always doing things like that?
Like the time she ran off to San Francisco.
I kind of like it;
shows she's got a lot of spunk.
The young lady will reappear when the mystic spirits are willing.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, while that beautiful young lady is out there floating around in space, I offer you for two bits, a quarter part of a dollar, this elixir of life...
You know, young lady, since you were kind enough to join our act, I hope you'll be discreet enough to keep our secret.
I'm Phil Reed, owner of the show.
Oh, I won't tell.
But I must say, I certainly expected much more than a back door in a trunk.
Mm.
I guess our magic is pretty simple, huh?
Is it?
You know, this is the most fascinating place
I've ever seen.
I, uh, I think you better get back in the trunk.
It won't take long before he sells all the snake oil.
Even when you know the tricks, there's such a strange atmosphere, such an air of excitement about it all.
It's a living.
Oh, I'm sure it's much more than that.
Much more.
I think you better get back to your friends, huh?
Please, Mr. Reed.
I can get away from my friends.
Now, look, if you're not in that box when he opens it, the whole act is gonna be ruined.
Isn't there any way I can change your mind, Mr. Reed?
Aren't you afraid of what could happen to you in a circus sideshow alone?
Afraid?
Mr. Reed, I'm not afraid of anything.
I'll bet you're not.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I think that the beautiful young lady, who has been so far away from us, may have returned.
Hey, where'd you go off to?
Far, far away.
No, really.
Yes, all the way behind that curtain over there.
Well, Jennifer, aren't you going to tell us about it?
Maybe.
Someday.
And that's only the beginning, folks, only the beginning.
I want to call your attention to one of the most sensational acts ever presented west of the Mississippi.
In just a few moments, directly next door, we're going to present that 350-pound strongman, Hercules!
Just follow me right this way.
The greatest act of its kind ever presented on our midway.
Right this way.
You'll love it.
It's a most sensational, outstanding act.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Hercules is going to bend this solid one-inch iron bar like it was made out of this sawdust on the floor.
Hercules.
How about that, folks?
Hey.
Would you like to, uh, examine that bar, sir, to see that it's genuine?
Thank you.
Would you like to examine this, sir?
Try that... right in there, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, I...
What are you, a smart aleck or something?
Ladies and gentlemen, if there's anybody in the audience who doubts the genuine strength of Hercules or thinks that this is some form of trickery, Hercules is now ready to match his strength against any two men in the audience.
And, furthermore, we're prepared to offer 50 bucks,
$50 to any man or woman who can force Hercules across this white line within the time limit of one minute.
Do we have any takers, huh?
What about you two stalwart young gentlemen down there, huh, with the two beautiful young ladies, huh?
- Us?
- Yeah, you two.
Come on up, boys, and show the girls how strong you are.
Go on, Little Joe.
You're not afraid to at least try, are you?
Why, he's bigger than anything!
Would you like to try your luck?
Come on, Hoss.
I think we can take him.
You wanna?
Go!
- Let's go.
All right, gentlemen, the time limit is one minute, remember, to pull Hercules across this white line.
Are you ready?
Go!
And now there, ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest advertisement in the world for our elixir of life.
Would you believe it, folks, at one time this poor boy was only a 74-pound weakling?
But after 90 days and 90 nights,
Hercules, taking this elixir of life, today, look at the results.
355 pounds of solid blubber, er, muscle.
There he is, folks, Hercules, at one time, a 74-pound weakling.
Come on!
All right, time!
Hercules is the winner.
Hercules the winner.
Now, I thank you very much, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Let's keep moving it along, folks.
Keep it moving along.
Some wonderful shows out on the midway.
See the sword-swallower and the fire-eater
- who swallows hot coals.
- Little Joe, Hoss...
Jennifer's gone!
She's disappeared out of the tent!
She's gone?
Didn't you see her leave?
I was watching the stage.
Why is she always doing things like this?
Oh, it's probably just her idea of some kind of a joke.
We gotta find her!
Oh, we're gonna find her.
And when we find her,
I'm gonna hogtie her for the rest of the evening.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Let's find out where she could be.
You didn't do so good tonight out there, Della.
Don't start an argument with me, Phil.
Not tonight.
I'm tired.
I'm talking about the good of the show.
Those rubes pay their money to see you give a performance.
How long do I have to keep on doing this?
You told me a year ago we could get married,
I could get out of the act and help you run the show.
Next time you go on, you give them their money's worth.
Another argument?
No, not really.
Just that I know him so well.
He saw a pretty young girl out in the audience tonight, captured his fancy.
He looks at her, wanting her, and... and then he looks at me.
Why don't you let me be the mystic in the show, huh?
I'll tell you what we'll do.
As soon as Hercules finishes his act, the three of us will go out and have a cup of coffee together.
I'll tell your fortune.
Step right over and take a little...
Oh, Mr. Reed.
I was looking for you.
I can't say I'm not flattered.
What are you doing wandering around out here alone?
What do you propose to do about it?
Send me back again?
Is there any reason why I shouldn't?
Just one, Mr. Reed.
It wouldn't do any good.
How does your father put up with you?
Oh, Father...
He just doesn't understand me.
He doesn't realize I'm not as conservative as young ladies of his day.
Why don't we go someplace where we can talk?
I was hoping you'd say that.
My wagon's right here.
Let's go.
Someday I'll kill him for what he does to her.
Poor Hercules.
Do you think that will make her love you?
I had no idea a sideshow wagon would be like this.
Well, not all of 'em are.
But there has to be some compensation for owning the show.
I'm sure there must be.
Now, what do you mean by that?
Oh, let's say, uh, compensation such as, uh... entertaining young ladies in your private quarters.
Isn't that right, Mr. Reed?
You're a very attractive young lady.
Thank you.
And you're a very handsome man.
Now, Mr. Reed, I-I thought we came in here to talk.
Can't you knock?
I can if I want to.
Hello, Miss Beale.
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, I know your name.
I know your father's name, too.
Joshua Beale?
The richest man on the Comstock.
How much do you suppose you're worth to that father of yours, Miss Beale?
Are you out of your mind, Gerner?
I, Mr. Reed?
Or you...
if you miss this chance!
We can break camp tonight.
By tomorrow morning, we can be over the mountain and well on our way to Placerville.
All you have to do is write a note to Joshua Beale.
$1 million... that's all it'll cost him to get his pretty little girl back home.
You'll never get away with it.
With your help, I can, Reed.
Listen, Reed, $1 million!
You know what that could mean?
You always wanted to make some big money.
No...
No... no!
Shut up!
Don't scream, lady!
This is a sharp knife.
Where do you think you'd hide her?
I thought you'd figure out a way.
You ought to hold her like I'm doing.
You don't know how good it feels to hold a million dollars.
We're gonna have to tie her up, Phil.
Get the rope.
It's right behind you.
No...
Go on, Phil!
No.
The most magnificent monstrosity ever foundered on the midway.
She's beautiful, she's glamorous, she's fat.
500 pounds of feminine pulchritude.
You're a good girl, Daisy.
Just keep quiet about it.
If anybody asks you, you haven't seen anything.
You understand?
You've always been my favorite, Daisy.
You can have a job with me as long as you want it.
Just keep quiet about it.
You don't know anything.
Okay?
She's beautiful, she's glamorous, she's fat.
500 pounds of...
Hey, Joe?
I'll ask this fella here.
It's only two bits, 25 cents, a quarter part of a dollar.
- On the inside.
What do you say, folks?
- Excuse me.
Just step right...
Hmm?
You ain't seen a little redheaded girl about so high, have you?
Why don't you look inside, buddy?
Get a ticket right over there.
Right this way, folks.
Follow me right next door here.
For those of you who have never seen the female figure in delicious movement from head to toe...
Ain't no use in asking him.
He's got a gullet full of sword, anyhow.
He wouldn't tell you anything, anyway.
These carny people stick together tighter than those bartenders in San Francisco the time they tried to shanghai our pa.
Oh, how do we know she's even here at all?
Well, where else would she be?
Salt Lake or St. Louis, for all we know.
Hoss, I think we can cover more ground if we split up.
Why don't you and Harriet look out here?
I'll check behind those tents.
All right.
You be careful, you hear?
Right.
Dad-gone if he don't get mixed up with some of the most dangest women I ever saw.
Now you be careful what you say, Hoss.
Jennifer's my best friend.
Now listen, if you're so dang close to her, why don't you tell her to be real friendly and come on back here?
Yes, what is it?
I saw your wagon.
I was just trying to find out who's in charge of the show.
I am.
Why, do you have a complaint?
No, no complaints.
See, I came here with a girl tonight, and now she's disappeared.
I just wondered if you might have seen her
Sonny, I see an awful lot of people, and happily, all paying customers.
Yeah, well, about this girl.
Her name's Jennifer.
Jennifer Beale.
She's 18, she has light red hair, brown eyes.
Well, from your description,
I can understand why you feel badly about losing her.
But you know what they say.
They don't always go home with the fellas that brought 'em.
Sorry, I can't help you.
May I come in?
My name is Joe Cartwright.
I just wondered if, uh...
You're a little young for this sort of thing, aren't you, Joe Cartwright?
Oh, look, you don't understand.
You see, I didn't come here to, uh...
What I mean is...
Exactly what do you mean, Joe?
Well, I'm sorry I barged in on you like this,
Miss Little Egypt.
Call me Della.
Thanks, Della.
See, I brought my girl to the show tonight.
Yes, I remember seeing her.
She's very pretty.
Yeah, well, she's disappeared.
I've been all over the carnival asking questions.
Nobody seems to want to give me any answers.
That's why when I saw your light, I...
Sure.
It hurts to lose someone, doesn't it?
Oh, it's not quite as painful as all that.
It's just that I am supposed to make sure she's all right.
I don't think she's run off with another fella.
All right, tell me about her.
Who is she?
Her name's Jennifer Beale.
Well, is there anything special about her or some reason someone might want to harm her?
Yeah, there's one big one:
Her father's one of the richest men on the Comstock.
Yes, that is a reason.
You stay here, Joe.
I'll go ask some questions.
Maybe I can find your girl for you.
Thanks, Della.
What you doing here, boy?
You looking for something to steal?
Now, wait a minute, mister.
I'm no thief.
Well, I think you are.
I think we better teach you a lesson.
Now, look, wait a minute, fellas.
We can ta...
Good job, boys.
Very good.
That'll teach him for snooping around, huh?
Wait a minute.
Is this his gun?
That's right.
Go ahead.
Hello, Della.
How'd you do?
Oh, pretty well.
How did you do?
What's that supposed to mean?
Something on your mind?
Well, a young man just paid me a visit in my tent, and, um, it seems he lost his girlfriend.
Well, what's that got to do with me?
Well, it just sounded familiar, that's all.
Aw, honey, I thought we weren't going to have any more of those suspicions.
I saw you talking to a girl earlier, Phil, and I saw you bring her in here.
Mm-hmm.
And if you'd hung around a few minutes, you would have seen her leave.
Oh, she was a child.
An innocent kid looking for adventure.
I got rid of her fast.
You are telling me the truth, aren't you, Phil?
You're not lying to me?
Ah, Della, there's nobody else but you.
Can't you believe that?
Sure, I can believe it.
Well, then let's forget about the girl.
I saw the kid who visited you in your tent.
I told him maybe his girl saw a boy she liked better and went home with him.
I guess that's what she did.
Sure.
Now come on, you're tired.
Get a little rest, because we're pulling out tonight.
- Tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
Why tonight?
I thought we were going to play this stand for the rest of the week.
We were.
But I changed my mind.
See you later.
You have got the girl, haven't you, Phil.
Are we going to start that all over again?
Oh, stop lying to me.
I know who she is and-and what you're trying to do.
All right, so you know!
Della, this is the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
Do you think you can kidnap Joshua Beale's daughter and get away with it?
She fell into our laps.
I didn't invite her in here...
she walked in.
She's worth a million dollars to us.
Do you know the kind of life we can have with a million dollars?
Oh, Phil, I love you...
I guess I always will... but I'd rather see you dead than mixed up in something like this.
Della, we're not going to harm the girl.
When Joshua Beale pays off, we'll turn her loose.
How can you stand there and say you're going to turn her loose?
Don't you know she'll remember you?
If you go through with this, you can't turn her loose.
Who said anything about turning her loose?
Does she know where the girl is?
No.
You shouldn't have told Della about the girl, Phil.
I didn't tell her, she figured it out.
Well, that's too bad.
Yes, that's very bad, isn't it, Phil?
All right, it's too bad.
I don't know where else we can look.
We done covered every inch of this carnival.
Twice.
Yeah.
I reckon I might as well be getting you on home, Harriet.
There ain't no use in your folks thinking you disappeared, too.
I wonder what happened to Little Joe.
Hoss...
Hey, Joe, what happened?
What's the matter, boy?
Four guys just piled me up in there.
I'll be all right, don't worry.
What happened to your gun?
They must have taken it after they beat me up.
You know, there's something real wrong around here, Hoss.
I got dumped because I was asking questions about Jennifer.
You mean th-this isn't just one of her jokes?
You think something's happened to her?
Hey, listen, Hoss, you take Harriet home.
On the way, stop by... tell Sheriff Brady to get over here to the carnival as quick as he can.
What are you going to be doing in the meantime?
The only thing I can do...
keep on looking.
Joe, you got to find her.
Yeah, Harriet, I know.
I'll bring the sheriff myself.
Be back in a minute.
- Come on.
- Right.
Joe.
Joe, what happened to you?
Where were you?
Oh, honey, that's a fine question for you to ask me.
After you had your four friends work me over.
Work you over?
Joe, I didn't...
I've got to talk to you.
It's about Jennifer.
All right, you said you knew something about Jennifer.
Please believe me, Joe,
I'm trying to help you find your girl.
She's somewhere here in the carnival.
We're going to find her, all right.
I've already sent for the sheriff.
Please, Joe, let me do this my way.
Don't call in the sheriff.
The carnival people are good friends of mine.
- They'll help.
- I've already seen the way they help.
I'll take the sheriff.
But if the sheriff comes, then a lot of innocent people will be hurt.
People I love, and...
that are good people that know nothing about this.
I'm sorry, I can't help that.
Joe, let me...
Della!
You killed her!
No, no!
Hercules, no!
Della wouldn't want it that way.
Come on.
Come on, Hercules.
Come on.
- I'm gonna kill you!
- No!
What happened?
Come on, fella.
Where?
What happened?
Where?
All right, quiet.
Quiet down, all of you!
I'm in charge here.
There's a lot of things I got to know.
Well, first of all, I didn't do it.
Second, they got Jennifer hid out around here someplace.
You better forget about Jennifer.
There's been a murder here.
Yeah, I know.
That girl was killed because she was trying to help me find Jennifer.
Do you know anything about this, Reed?
Well, the boy talked to me.
I've questioned everybody in the show, and nobody knows anything about her.
Is this your gun?
Yes, it's my gun, but I didn't have it when...
I think you'd better come along with me.
Look, I'm not going to leave here till we find Jennifer.
Son, I know Jennifer as well as you do.
Maybe better.
I had a posse out combing the hills for her that time she run off to San Francisco.
Joe, maybe you ought not to make any more trouble for yourself.
Come along.
Hey, look what's happened.
Hey, he's gone this way.
Cartwright, in here.
I'm trying to help you.
In here.
I don't know what you're up to, mister, but thanks a lot.
I'm not up to anything.
I'm Roudin.
I was Della Thompson's closest friend.
I don't believe you killed her.
Ma'am, are you sure you didn't see him come by here?
I didn't see anything.
I just sit here.
I don't see nothing.
Sheriff, I know Little Joe didn't kill that woman, but I'd a-heap rather see him in your jail as running loose around here.
Well, we're not going to learn anything here.
Now listen to me... there's only so many wagons and so many tents.
So we'll search 'em one by one.
Hoss, you take one party, I'll take the other.
Right.
It could be kidnapping.
I'm sure Della thought so, too.
She was just getting ready to tell me something when she was killed.
I believe you, Joe.
But I don't know what to do about it.
What can you do?
Well, we're a funny bunch here.
In time, we get to believing our own acts.
Maybe I can do a little mind reading.
In here.
There's no use searching for the girl in here, Hercules.
I'm not looking for the girl.
I'm looking for the man that killed Della.
Do you think I'd protect anyone that harmed Della?
I gotta find him.
I gotta kill him with my bare hands.
I always told Della I'd kill anybody that harmed her.
I'm your friend, Hercules.
Don't you trust me?
All I know is, Della is dead.
You stay here.
I'm going out back.
You stay here.
You there, Roudin?
Yes, I'm here.
I told you there was no trick.
I'll find him, and when I do, I'll kill him.
Well, I wish there was some way to convince him you're innocent.
So do I.
Oh, he'd make a good ally.
He's really a nice man.
And he was in love with Della Thompson.
Him?
Well, we're all freaks here... one way or another.
Doesn't mean we don't have any heart.
Thanks.
What are you going to do?
Keep on searching.
I know these folks are friends of yours, but one of them's a killer.
I've got to get to Jennifer before he does.
Don't make a sound, or I...
My, you're a forceful one, aren't you?
Look...
I'm, uh, I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.
I, uh...
See, I-I thought you were going to scream.
Just because a handsome man came in my tent?
Why, what makes you think I'd scream?
Well, you're the one they're looking for, aren't you?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And, uh, well, they're looking for me all over the place.
I think I better get out of here, before I get you in a lot of trouble.
- Don't go.
- Don't go?
Maybe I'd like to get into a lot of trouble.
Well, uh, well, ma'am, m-maybe sometime we could, uh, we could talk.
That's what they all say.
Now, why don't you just relax and we can get acquainted?
Well, ma'am, l-l-I just really don't think this is a time to get acquainted.
I saw you earlier this evening... with that girl.
Now, I thought she was too young for you.
I think you'd prefer a more sophisticated lady, like me.
Now wouldn't you?
Ma'am, I...
Can I come in, ma'am?
Quick, behind the dresses.
I'll protect you.
And, uh, after they've gone...
Uh, you seen a young fella go by here, doesn't belong to the carnival?
No, I haven't seen anyone.
Ma'am.
They're gone, honey.
Honey?
Say, has anybody searched this wagon yet?
I'm sure the other party searched it thoroughly.
They've searched here, Daisy, haven't they?
Yes, they've searched very good.
Well, I didn't see it.
I think I'll take a look.
Uh, Sheriff, if you don't mind.
There are very few people that Daisy lets into her wagon.
I'd rather somebody search it that she knows.
You understand.
Yeah, I think I understand.
Gerner, why don't you take a look and satisfy the sheriff?
Well, if that's what the sheriff wants.
Look in there behind those clothes.
Gerner, look in the back of the wagon.
Nobody here, Sheriff.
Any luck at all?
Nope.
Looks like that little brother of mine disappeared as completely as that gal did.
Well, Sheriff, you convinced she's not here?
I'll decide that.
As you wish.
Just trying to cooperate.
Sheriff, um, we got to start tearing down camp.
We open in Placerville day after tomorrow.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Reed?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm going to find the guy that killed Della.
There's coffee up in the cook tent.
Why don't we all settle down for a bit?
That's a good idea, Mr. Roudin.
Right this way, sir.
Let's go get some coffee.
I'd like to talk to you, Phil.
What about?
I think you know.
I'm no more of a mind reader than you are.
No, but you are a carnival man.
A lot of people depend on you, Phil.
Well, haven't I always come through for them?
Yes.
But will you come through for them now?
You think I had something to do with that girl's disappearance, don't you?
I think you could...
shed some light on it, yes.
Well, you're wrong.
If I am, I'll back you up.
But if I'm right...
I'll turn your people against you, Phil, and I can do it.
Hercules, for one, has always hated you for the way you treated Della.
Hey, thanks for not sneaking up on me.
You little galoot.
What are you trying to do?
I'm still trying to find Jennifer.
She's around here someplace, Hoss.
Della knew it.
That's what she was trying to tell me when she was killed.
Now, let's go over it again.
Just how much was she able to tell you?
Nothing.
It was as though she wanted me to know, and yet she didn't want me to know.
I don't know...
maybe she was trying to... trying to protect someone.
Of course.
I should have known.
Phil Reed...
she would want to protect him.
Mr. Roudin, if Phil Reed knows something about this that he ain't telling, I'll choke it out of him.
Then you'd have the carnival people and the sheriff down on you.
I know these people.
They've got a strange kind of loyalty.
Yeah, I can believe that.
I couldn't find out a thing from any of them.
Hercules is the only one that...
that might turn against Reed.
You got any idea how you can convince him to help us?
Well, not so long as he's with the others.
Yeah, well, suppose we could get him away... someplace where we could talk to him.
Yeah, but how you figurin' on doin' that?
Well, he's pretty anxious to get his hands on me.
Let's...
let's let him know where I am.
Yeah, wait a minute.
Ain't that a little risky?
Look, I'll chance it.
What do you think, Mr. Roudin?
Well, Reed is afraid of Hercules... deathly afraid...
and with reason.
It might work.
Yeah?
Well, just in case it don't, I'm gonna be around.
Thanks.
Look, I'll meet you outside of town.
There's a grove of live oaks.
Hoss knows the place.
Right.
Let's go.
I thought you said there wouldn't be any trouble.
There won't be.
Cartwright.
Cartwright.
You might as well come out now.
My mystic powers have told me where to find you, just as they let me read through a blindfold.
No, wait, Hercules.
If my powers told me where to find him, they-they'd...
let me read his mind!
Hercu...
Hercules!
Hercules.
Hercules!
Come on!
Come on!
Joe...
- I got him in a hammer, Joe.
Hold him.
- Yeah.
Hercules, Hercules, listen to me.
Hercules, we don't want to hurt you, but we just want you to know that Joe didn't harm your Della.
And if you go chasing after Little Joe while the guilty one gets away, you're not showing any love for Della.
You're letting her down.
You say you loved Della.
You think you're the only man who loved somebody that didn't love him back?
Listen, Hercules.
Mr. Reed is the only one who really knows what happened to Della.
He used to make Della cry.
Remember, Hercules?
We want Mr. Reed to tell us what he knows.
Will you help us?
I'll go with you.
Think the sheriff has given up yet?
He never did think we had the girl.
Didn't I tell you it'd be easy?
Oh, think of it, Phil.
$1 million... that's what that girl's going to bring us.
Mr. Reed, Gerner.
I think there's something you ought to know.
You two know what's good for you, you'll keep it quiet.
You made Miss Della cry, and you're going to pay for this.
That ain't all you're gonna do, buster.
You're gonna tell us everything you know about that little girl that disappeared and about Miss Della.
I don't know a thing about it.
Maybe you better ask him your way, then, Hercules.
Stop him!
Stop him!
What do you know, Phil?
Tell us and I'll make him quit.
It was Gerner!
Gerner killed Della.
I had nothing to do with it!
You're a dirty liar!
Get the sheriff.
You liar.
You're the one that killed Della!
It was all Gerner's idea.
He kidnapped the girl, and then he killed Della because she was going to tell where the girl was hidden.
- Well, where is she, man?
- She's down at...
Get him!
- Hey...
- Reed.
The girl... where is she?
Where is she?
Ask... ask Daisy.
Joe!
Sheriff!
Joe!
Well, young fella, where you been?
You've caused us enough trouble.
Wait a minute, Sheriff.
It was Gerner that killed the girl.
He just killed Mr. Reed, and he got away, and Hercules is after him.
Did you find out anything about Jennifer?
Just before Mr. Reed died, he said, "Ask Daisy."
- That's the fat lady.
- Well, let's go.
You'd better let me handle this.
You keep the others back, or we'll never get anything out of her.
- You come with me, Little Joe.
- Right.
Daisy...
I'm your friend.
You know that, don't you?
Mr. Reed said that you knew something about the girl that disappeared.
Can you tell us anything?
All right, Daisy.
Thanks a lot.
Daisy...
Daisy, are you sure?
Are you sure that you can't tell us anything about the girl?
No, Daisy!
No!
You don't have to protect Mr. Reed anymore.
Mr. Reed is dead.
Do you understand, Daisy?
Mr. Reed is dead.
Mr. Reed... dead?
Now, Daisy.
- Oh, no.
- Daisy.
In the back.
Daisy.
Jennifer, where are you?
Joe...
Joe.
You know, I ought to leave you tied up till I get you home.
Oh!
Oh, Joe.
That's all right.
You're okay now.
What are we going to do now, Mr. Roudin?
Were going on, just as usual.
It's the only thing we can do.
If you need anything, Mr. Roudin, you let us know.
Well, thanks very much, but there's very little pleasure people like us have except the satisfaction of helping ourselves.
Joe, don't you let that gal out of your sight no more, you hear?
Little Joe, can you ever forgive me?
Well...
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I can forgive you.
Of course, it's going to take some time.
Quite some time.
This has been a color presentation of the NBC Television Network.
See the fabulous Little Egypt... who once danced for the Queen of England.
Little Egypt, the dancer...
For those who've seen a female figure... in delicious movements from head to toe.
You can see her there for US$0,25.
Isn't the fattest woman you've ever seen?
Fora daqui eu não sei
I can't stand look at her!
Suppose he miss!
He won't miss.
Aren't you scared, Jennifer?
What's here to be scared of?
I'd give anything to change places with her.
Adam, you and I would better get on our way.
We've been here longer than we planed.
Harriet, Jennifer, good night.
You've promised to bring the girls home by ten...
Mr. Cartwright, please, you have to remind me?
I'll keep an eye on her.
But who's gonna keep an eye on him?
It's easy, Ross will.
-Isn't that right, Ross?
-I mean, sir?
He'll do fine, pa, ask no more.
You're going to see the girl move every muscle...
-Good night, girls.
-Good night, Ross.
Good night.
Isn't this the best burn thing you've ever seen, Joe?
You'rejust not kidding.
Seen anything special?
That girl, the red hair.
She looks familiar.
What tent we'll go first?
How about the mystic tent?
They'll tell my fortune.
I'd like to hear that.
Wouldn't you Harriet?
Not is it's any bad news.
She's been plasted all over the front pages... of the San Francisco papers.
It's Joshua Bill's daughter.
Joshua Bill?
The silver key.
It's one of the richest men in the world.
Stop dreaming, Groner.
The most electrifying act ever to appear... on the midway West of the Mississippi.
Just once I'd like to get my hands in real money.
How do you think Bill figures that daughter worth to him?
More money you will ever see.
You're gonna let this guy read your future?
May be.
Ever since that red man read my palm... and said I was going to do a long trip...
I can't get my feet back I can't eat my meal!
If one of you will give to my assistant... some personal object?
Don't be afraid, ladies and gentleman... nothing will happen to it.
If you please, some personal object!
Are you ready, Mr. Wizard?
I am ready.
Can you tell me what I'm holding in my hand?
A round object... of precious metal.
I hear a strange sound, very strange sound.
I believe it is... a gold pocket watch.
How do you reckon he done it?
-Beats me.
-Do you think it's a trick?
-Of course it's a trick.
-How do you know?
-I just know it.
-Silence!
And now, I will bring to you... the most outstanding acts of all magic.
Tonight, just to prove to you... that it's an outstanding and remarkable feat... instead of using my regular assistant...
I shall ask one of you to assist me.
Is there a young lady in the audience... who'd like to disappear for a few minutes?
I assure you it's a thrill you never realized before.
I'd like to try.
What your pa said about leaving Little Joe sight?
I didn't say anything.
This will be fun.
If you disappear that's gonna be leaving his sight.
Sit down!
Everybody is looking at you!
Joe, won't you stop her?
Let her go ahead.
It'sjus a trick.
It seems a shame to make such a lady disappear.
Don't worry.
I'll have her back to you.
See, ladies and gentlemen... this is an ordinary wardrobe.
Young lady.
Where am I?
Backstage.
And I open it.
Why she always does things like that?
Like the time she run of to San Francisco.
She likes it.
She's got a lot of spunk.
Young lady will reappear... when the mystic spirits are willing.
While that young lady is out there in space...
I offer you, for two bits of US$ 0,25... this elixir of life.
If you were kind enough tojoin the act...
I hope you'll be discreet enough to keep our secret.
I'm Phill Reed, the owner of the show.
I wont tell.
But I must say...
I expected much more than a backdoor on a trunk.
Our magic is pretty simple.
It's the most fascinating place I've ever seen.
I think you'd better get in the trunk.
It won't take long before he sells all the elixir.
Even when you know the tricks... it's such a strange atmosphere.
Such an air of excitement about it all.
It's a living.
I'm sure it's much more than that.
Much more.
I think you'd better go back to your friends.
Please, Mr. Reed....
I can get away from my friends.
If you're not in that box the at is going to be ruined.
Isn't any way I can change your mind, Mr. Reed?
Aren't you afraid of what could happen to you... in a circus site show alone?
Afraid?
Mr. Reed, I'm not afraid of anything.
I bet you are not.
Now, ladies and gentleman...
I think the beautiful lady who's been so far away... will return.
Where did you go of to?
-Far, far away.
-No, really.
Way behind that curtain over there.
Aren't you going to tell us?
Maybe, someday.
That's only the beginning, only the beginning.
I wanna call your attention... to one of the most sensational acts... ever presented West from the Mississippi.
In a few moments, next door, we're going to present... that 350 pound man, Hercules!
Follow me this way.
The most sensational outstanding act...
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
Hercules is going to band a solid one inch iron bar... like it was made of this sawdust on the floor.
How about that?
Would you like to examine that bar, sir... to see that it's genuine?
Thank you.
Would you like to examine this, sir?
Ladies and gentlemen... if anybody doubts the strength of Hercules... or thinks it's some form of trickery...
Hercules is ready to match his strength... against any two man in the audience.
to whom we're prepared to offer US$ 50.
US$ 50 to any man or woman who can force Hercules... across this white line... in less than one minute.
We have any takes?
What about you two young gentlemen... with the beautiful young ladies?
-Us?
-Yes, you two.
Show the girls how strong you are.
You're not afraid to at least try?
Are you?
He is bigger than anything!
Would you like to try, you lot?
Ross, we can take him.
-You're on?
-Let's go.
Gentlemen, the time is one minute... to pull Hercules across this white line.
Ready?
Go!
He is the greatest advertisement in the world... for the elixir of life!
Would you believe this man was only a 74-pound!
For 90 days and 90 nights... taking this elixir of life...
Look at the results!
355 pounds of solid blubber... muscle!
One time a 74-pound-weak man!
Come on!
Fine.
Hercules is a winner.
Thank you.
Let's keep moving it along.
One of the shows of the midway.
See the sword swallower.
Jennifer is gone.
She's disappear out of the tent!
Did you see her leave?
I was watching the stage.
Why is she always doing things like this?
It's her idea of some kind of ajoke.
-We got to find her.
-We're going to find her.
When we find her I'm going to hug-tie her.
Come on, let's go.
Let's find out where is she!
div ant
You didn't do so good tonight out there, Della.
Don't start an argument tonight, I'm tired.
I'm talking about the good of the show.
Those rubes pay to see you give a performance.
How long do I have to keep on doing this?
You told me an year ago we could get married...
I could get out of the act... and help you on the show.
Next time you give then their money's worth.
-Another argument?
-Not really.
I know him so well.
He saw a pretty young girl at the audience tonight.
Capture his fancy.
He looks at her wanting her... and then he looks at me.
Why don't you let me be the mystic on the show?
I tell you what we'll do.
As soon as Hercules finishes his act... the three of us are having a cup of coffee together.
I tell your fortune.
Mr. Reed!
I was looking for you.
I can't say I'm not flattered.
What are you doing wandering around out here alone?
What do you propose to do about it?
Is there any reason I shouldn't?
Just one, Mr. Reed.
It wouldn't do any good.
How do your father put up with you?
My father, hejust doesn't understand!
I'm not as conservative as the ladies of his days.
div ant
Why don't we go some place where we can talk?
I was hopping you to say that.
My wagon is right here.
Let's go!
Some day I'll kill him for what he does to her.
Poor Hercules... do you think that will make her love you?
I had no idea your wagon would be like this.
That's for some compensation for running the show.
I'm sure there must be.
What do you mean by that?
Entertaining young ladies in your private quarters.
Isn't that right, Mr. Reed?
You are a very attractive young lady.
Thank you.
And you are a very handsome man.
Mr. Reed...
I though we came in here to talk.
-Can't you knock?
-I can, if you want to.
Hello, Miss Bill.
I didn't tell you my name.
I know your name.
I know your father's name too.
Joshua Bill.
The richest man in the Comstock?
How much do you suppose you worth to your father?
-You are out of your mind.
-I, Mr. Reed?
Or you, if you miss this chance?
We can break camp tonight.
By tomorrow we can be on our way to Plasterville.
All you have to do is write a note to Joshua Bill.
One million dollars... that's what it will cost to get the girls home.
We'll never get away with this.
With your help I can.
One million dollars...
You know what that could mean?
You always wanted to make some big money.
Shut up!
Don't scream, lady.
This is a sharp knife.
-Where we'd hide her?
-I thought you'd figure.
Hold her like I'm doing.
See how good it feels to hold a million dollars.
We have to tie her up to.
Get the rope, it's right behind you.
Go on!
You are a good girl, Daisy.
Just keep quiet about it.
Anybody asks, you didn't see anything.
You'll always be my favorite, Daisy.
You can have ajob with me as long as you want to.
Just keep quiet about it.
It's only two bits of one quarter of a dollar.
Excuse me.
You ain't seen a red hair girl... about this high, have you?
Look inside, buddy.
Get a ticket right over there.
Ain't no use asking him.
He's got a gullet full of sword anyway.
He wouldn't tell us anything anyway.
This carny people stick together... tied than bartenders in San Francisco... the time they tried to help her escape.
How do we know she's here at all?
Where else would she be?
South Lake or even Saint Louis!
We can cover more ground if we split up.
You look out here I'll check behind those tents.
Be careful.
Hope she's not mixed up with someone.
You be careful what you say.
She's my best friend.
Why don't you tell her to come on back here?
What is it?
I saw your wagon, and want to know who's in charge.
I am.
Do you have a complaint?
No complaints.
I came with a girl and she's disappeared.
Did you see the girl?
I see a lot of people haply all paying customers.
About this girl... her name is Jennifer Bill.
She is 18, she has light red hair, brown eyes...
I understand why you feel badly about loosing her.
But you know what they say.
They don't always go home with the fellows that brought them.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Can I come in?
My name is Joe Cartwright.
I just wandered if...
You are young for this sort of thing, Joe Cartwright.
You don't understand.
I didn't come here to...
-What I mean is...
-What do you mean, Joe?
I'm sorry I bodged in like this, Miss...
Call me Della.
I brought my girl to the show tonight.
I remember seeing her.
She's disappear.
I asked all over nobody gave me any answer.
When I saw your light, I...
Sure.
It hurt to loose someone.
It's not as painful as it looks.
I am supposed to make sure she is all right.
I don't think she's run of with another fellow.
Tell me about it.
Who is she?
Her name is Jennifer Bill.
Is there anything special about her?
Any reason someone might want to harm her?
A big one.
Her father is one of the richest man of the Comstock.
It is a reason.
You stay here, Joe.
I'll go ask some questions.
Maybe I can find your girl for u.
Thanks, Della.
What do you do here, boy?
Looking for something to steal?
-I'm no thieve.
-I think you are.
We'd better teach you a lesson.
Wait, fellows, we can talk.
Good job, boys, that will teach him.
Wait a minute.
-Is this his gun?
-That's right.
Hello, Della, how do you do?
Pretty well.
How did you do?
what that's supposed to mean?
Anything on your mind?
A young man just paid me a visit.
It seems he lost his girlfriend.
What that has to do with me?
Itjust sounded familiar, that's all.
We weren't going to have any more of this suspicions.
I saw you talking to a girl earlier.
And I saw you bringing her in here.
If you'd hang around you'd see her leave.
She was a child.
An innocent kid looking for adventure.
I got rid of her fast.
You are telling me the true?
You are no lying to me?
Della, there is nobody else.
can't you believe?
Sure.
I can believe it.
Let's forget about the girl.
I saw the boy visiting you in your tent.
Maybe the girl saw a boy she liked and went home with him.
-I guess that's what she did.
-Sure.
You are tired.
Get a rest, we're pulling out tonight.
I thought we were staying for the rest of the week.
We were, but I changed my mind.
See you later.
You have got the girl, haven't you?
-We are starting that?
-Stop lying to me.
I know who she is and what are you trying to do.
All right, so you know!
It's the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
Do you think you can kidnap Joshua Bill's daughter?
She fall on our laps.
I didn't invite her, she walked in.
She's worth US$1 million to us.
You know the life we could have with a US$1 million?
I love you.
I always will.
But I'd rather see you dead then mixed up in this.
We're not gonna harm the girl.
When Joshua Bill pays off, we turn her loose.
How can you say that?
Don't you know she'll remember you?
If you do this, you can't turn her loose.
Who said anything about turning her loose?
Does she know where the girl is?
You shouldn't have told Della about the girl.
I didn't tell, she figured it out.
That's too bad.
That's very bad, isn't it, Phill.
That's too bad.
We covered every inch of this carnival.
Twice.
I'll bring you home.
Your folks will think you disappeared too.
What happened to Little Joe?
Ross.
What happened?
Four guysjust beat me in there.
-I'll be all right.
-What happened to your gun?
They must have taken it after they beat me up.
There is something wrong around here.
It happened because I asked questions about Jennifer.
This isn't one of herjokes?
Something happened to her?
Take Harriet home.
In the way ask the sheriff to come here.
What will you do in the meantime?
The only thing I can do.
Keep on looking.
You gotta find her.
I know.
I'll bring the sheriff myself.
What happened to you?
Where were you?
Fine question to ask... after your four friends work me over.
Work you over?
I didn't...
I have to talk to you.
About Jennifer.
You said you knew something about Jennifer.
Please, Joe, I'm trying to find your girl.
She's here at the carnival.
We'll find her.
I've already sent for the sheriff.
Please, Joe, let me do this my way.
Don't call the sheriff.
The carnival people are good friends of mine.
I've seen the way they help, I'll take the sheriff.
If the sheriff comes, innocent people will be hurt.
People I love... good people that know nothing about this.
Sorry, I can't help this.
Joe, let me...
You killed her!
Hercules!
Della wouldn't want it that way.
Come on, boy.
I'll kill you.
What happened?
Why?
I'm in charge here!
A lot of things I gotta know.
First of all, I didn't do it.
Second, they got Jennifer hidden here someplace.
Forget Jennifer!
There's been a murder here.
Because she was helping me find Jennifer.
Do you know anything about it?
The boy talked to me I talked to everybody.
No one knows anything about it.
Is this your gun?
It's my gun, but I didn't have it when...
You'd better come with me.
I'm not leaving before we find Jennifer.
I know Jennifer as well as you do, maybe better.
I sent a posse after her... that time she run off to San Francisco.
Joe, you ought not to make more trouble for yourself.
-Look what happened here.
-In here.
I'm trying to help.
In here.
I don't know what you're up to, but thank you.
I'm not up to anything.
I'm Roudin.
I was Della Thompson's closest friend.
I don't believe you killed her.
Are you sure you didn't see anyone come by here?
I didn't see anything.
I just sit here.
I don't see nothing.
I know Little Joe didn't kill that woman.
But I'd rather see him in jail... then loose around here.
We won't find anything here.
Listen to me!
There are so many wagons and so many tents.
We'll search one by one.
Ross, you take one party, I'll take the other.
It could be kidnapping.
Della thought so too.
She was going to tell me, when she was killed.
I believe you, Joe.
But I don't know what to do.
What can you do?
We're a funny bunch here.
In time, we believe in our own acts.
Maybe I could do a little mind reading.
In here.
Searching for the girl in here?
I'm looking for the man who killed Della.
I'd protect anyone that harmed Della?
I gotta find him.
Gotta kill him with my bare hands.
I always said to Della...
I'd kill anybody that harmed her.
I'm your friend, Hercules.
Don't you trust me?
All I know is Della is dead.
You stay here.
I'm going out there.
You stay here.
Are you there, Roudin?
I'm here.
I told you there was no trick.
I'll find him... and when I do, I'll kill him.
I wish I could convince him you are innocent.
So do I.
He'd make a good ally.
He's a good man.
He was in love with Della Thompson.
We are all freaks here... one way or another.
Doesn't mean we don't have any heart.
Thanks.
What are you going to do?
Keep on searching.
This people are friends of yours... but one of them is a killer.
I gotta get to Jennifer before he does.
Don't make a sound!
You are a forceful man!
I'm sorry.
I though you were going to scream.
Because a handsome man came in my tent?
Why would I scream?
You're the one they are looking for?
They are looking for me all over the place.
I'd better get out before I get you in trouble.
Don't go.
Maybe I'd like a trouble.
Maybe sometime we could talk.
That's what they all say.
Why don't you just relax and we can get acquainted.
It's not a time to get acquainted.
I saw you earlier, with that girl.
She was too young for you.
You'd prefer a more sophisticated lady like me.
Can I come in?
Behind the dresses.
I'll protect you.
And after they're gone...
Did you see a young man that is not on the show?
I haven't seen anyone.
They are gone, honey.
Honey?
Did anybody search this wagon yet?
The other party searched it thoroughly.
They searched in here?
They searched very good.
I think I'll take a look.
Sheriff, if you don't mind... there are very few people that Daisy lets in.
I'd rather somebody search that she knows.
I think I understand.
Groner, why don't you take a look?
It that's what the sheriff wants.
Look behind those clothes.
Be quiet.
Look in the back of the wagon.
Nobody here, sheriff.
Any luck at all?
My brother disappeared like the girl.
Are you convinced he's not here?
-I'll decide that.
-As you wish.
Just trying to cooperate.
Sheriff, we got to start tear down the camp.
We open in Plasterville the day after tomorrow.
Isn't that right, Mr. Reed?
I'm going to find the guy who killed Della.
There is coffee in the cook tent.
Why don't we all settle down a little.
Good idea.
I'd like to talk to you.
About?
I think you know.
I'm no more a mind reader than you are.
No, but you are a carnival man.
A lot of people depend on you.
Didn't I always come trough for them?
Will you come trough for them?
You think I had something to do with the disappearance?
I think you could.
Sheds some light on it, yes.
You are wrong.
If I am, I'll back you up.
But if I'm not...
I'll turn your people against you....
Hercules always hated you for the way you treated Della.
Thanks for not snagging up on me.
What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to find Jennifer.
She's around here.
Della knew it.
She was trying to tell me when she was killed.
How much was she able to tell you?
Nothing.
She want me to know.
She wanted protect someone.
Of course!
I should have known.
Phill Reed.
She would protect him.
Mr. Roudin...
If Phill knows something I'll kill him.
You'd have the carnival people and the sheriff after you.
This people have a strange kind of loyalty.
I couldn't find anything from any of them.
Hercules is the only one that might go against Reed.
How can you convince him to help us?
Not if he is with the others.
Suppose we can get him away and talk.
How you figure we can do that?
He's anxious to put his hands on me.
Letsjus let him know where I am.
Isn't that a little risky?
What do you think, Mr. Roudin?
Reed is afraid of Hercules.
And with reason.
Might work.
Just in case, I'll be around.
Thanks.
I'll meet you outside the town.
There is a grove of live oaks.
Ross knows the place.
You said there won't be any trouble.
There won't be.
Cartwright!
Might as well come up now.
My powers had told me where to find you.
Wait, Hercules!
If my powers had told me where to find him...
I got him, you hold him!
Listen, Hercules!
We didn't wanna hurt you.
Wejust want you to know, we didn't harm your Della.
If you chase Joe while the guilty one gets away... you are not showing any love for Della.
You say you love Della.
You're not the only where someone don't love you back.
Listen, Hercules.
Mr. Reed is the only who really knows what happened.
He used to make Della cry.
Remember?
We want Mr. Reed to tell us what he knows.
Will you help us?
I'll go with you.
Did the sheriff give up yet?
He never did think we have the girl.
Didn't I tell it would be easy?
Think of it!
One million!
That's the girl's worth!
Mr. Reed?
There is something you ought know..
After him.
Keep it quiet!
You made Miss Della cry, you're gonna pay for this.
You're gonna tell us about the girl who disappear.
And about Miss Della.
I don't know a thing about it.
Ask him your way, Hercules.
Stop him!
Stop him!
I did it!
-I did it!
-Make him quiet.
It was Groner.
He killed Della.
Dirty liar!
You're the one that killed Della.
He kidnapped the girl and he killed Della.
She was gonna tell where the girl was hidden.
Where is she, man?
She is at the...
The girl, where is she?
Ask Daisy.
Where have you been?
You caused enough trouble.
Wait sheriff, Groner killed the girl.
He killed Mr. Reed and got away.
Hercules is after him.
Where is Jennifer?
Before Reed die, he said ask Daisy.
-That's the fat lady.
-Let's go.
Let me have this.
Keep the others back or we won't get anything of her.
Come with me, Little Joe.
I'm your friend, you know that.
Mr. Reed said that you knew about the girl that disappear.
Can you tell us anything?
All right, Daisy, thanks a lot.
Are you sure... that you can't tell us anything about the girl?
You don't have to protect Mr. Reed anymore.
Mr. Reed is dead.
Do you understand?
Mr. Reed is dead.
Mr. Reed is dead?
Jennifer, where are you?
I ought to leave you tied up until I get you home!
That's all right now.
What are we going to do now?
We are going on just as usual.
If you need anything, you let us know.
Thanks.
There's little help people like us have except helping ourselves.
Joe, don't let that girl out of your site.
Can you ever forgive me?
I think I can forgive you.
But it's gonna take some time.
Quite some time.
- Is he back?
- Not yet
But don't trouble yourself, commander for it is a judgement of God
- Judgement of God?
- Brother Rotgier is a famous knight
- But he should already be here
- He will return covered in new glory
Go and see who that is
Take the body to the chapel
Thus, they have sent him back
Is brother Rotgier already in the chapel?
Yes
Tell Diederich to come here with the keys and the lantern...
My coat
Let him also bring a brazier with charcoal
Dear son...
And you wrote to me that he was almost a child...
The whole arm
Many times you raised it for the Order's glory and now a Polish axe has hewn it off
The Lord did not bless you
Perhaps he does not care anymore for our Order
He has abandoned me also, although I have served Him my whole life
No, no, this is not possible, for we are in the right
Ours is the just cause
I do love you my son, and you will never speak again
Wait.
I will make you happy
Ready?
Once you told what brother Godfryd had ordered you to do and you lost your tongue
So, I tell you, that if with a single movement you show what you have done by my order, I will have you hanged
Do you understand?
Go on
On your knees, you dog
Get out
Light
You were promised that you would go free but the tongue with which you blasphemed will be torn out
Brother Rotgier is waiting.
I promised him to lay your right hand in his coffin
You still have one eye left
I only had you and now I have no-one
Listen, dear son, I vow to you I will lay the hand which slew you on your grave or perish myself
But before I get him I will make him suffer worse
He will not see that girl again
Who is there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Once I knelt under the headman's axe for I raised my sword against the Knights of the Order
Let the headsman cut off my head because I am going to raise it again
The Knights of the Order kidnapped Danusia
They drew Jurand into a trap
I will go alone and perish under their walls
Let the world know about the wrongs done by them
Order my head cut off but defend them, intercede for them with the Grand Master
Stop it.
Have you proved Jurand and his daughter were lured into a trap?
- Who else could have done it, my lord?
- Have you any witnesses?
Gracious lord, I have been informed that in the woods in Carpathia in a hut belonging to simple charcoal-burners Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine was lying wounded
I sincerely apologise, worshipful king, I am not able to make due homage
They stabbed me in my back and the wound has not healed
What has this to do with kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
I testify, gracious lord, that the monks from Szczytno discussed the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter
They stabbed me on the road like a wild boar because I wanted to prevent that mean trick
Will you repeat it in the presence of the Grand Master?
I witnessed here in Cracow against Jurand and now when the justice demands it I will witness against the monks from Szczytno...
Gracious lord...
Sir, accept my homage and my deep gratitude
Are you Zbyszko of Bogdaniec?
The most humble homage to the knight of the most beautiful girl in the world
If you deny it I will have to challenge you to combat on foot or on horse
Duchess Anna Danuta
Who is she, that most beautiful lady in the world?
Jagienka.
I can hardly believe my own eyes you look so beautiful.
How come you are in court?
My father has died.
The duchess agreed most kindly to protect me but I am always longing for Zgorzelice
Uncle, you are also here?
I have always told you, young boar, that she is like a deer, haven't I?
Noble Lord, the king asks you to come
Excuse me, sir
I have one more piece of bad news for you, my Lords
The Knights of the Teutonic Order robbed the ships loaded with grain which we sent to Lithuania
They spread rumours we supplied the Samogitians with arms
What does Jungingen want?
To sell our grain to the Lithuanians or start the war?
Is war inevitable?
Can we let them conquer Samogitia, Lithuania?
Will they stop after that?
The Order is an unconquered power
True, we will perish if we allow them to surprise us in a single battle
In alliance with Lithuania, Ruthenia and other peoples, we will win
Gracious Lord have I to speak truly or beautifully?
Do tell the truth, Castellan
Do you bid us, my king, to enter into an alliance with pagans and eastern schismatics against the Order?
Such plans do not correspond with a Christian leader
To weaken the Order means to weaken Christianity
You were to tell the truth, Castellan.
Do I want war?
Who blocks the way to overseas countries for our grain?
Who annexed Eastern Pommeranie?
If war breaks out, it will be a most cruel one and that is why we already think about the necessary preparations
But first we shall try to mitigate the matter
Castellans, Gracious Lords we shall summon the Order to give us back the ships with grain
Our envoys shall go to Malbork
How you have changed...
Sieur de Lorche would like to ask you, sir, whether that young lady is a mortal being or is she perhaps and angel?
Tell Sieur de Lorche it is an angel who chose a devilishly beautiful bodily cover for the time it stay among the mortals
Please, don't Zbyszko
What about Danusia?
Are there any news?
I do not know...
We are going to Malbork
The Gracious Lord agreed that you join us
Thank you, sir
- Uncle
- Yes...
- Jurand burdened me with Spychow
- Yes
In case I did not come back from Malbork please go to Spychow and defend the castle...
And who will dwell in Bogdaniec?
Just look at him.
He has a girl, who would crush all the nuts spread on the bench if she sat on them!
And he goes away into the world!
I beg you to do me this favour
If I am not back soon, go to Spychow
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Welcome Polish Knights
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Brother, lead the noble Polish lords and conceal nothing
Are these prisoners of war?
These are wretched rebels, heretics and pagans
They work here for the glory of God
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
My heart is full of joy, Gracious Lords that we sit together at one table, as it is fitting for good Christians...
Let us not allow the Samogitians to incite war between the Order and your king...
There is proof of all sorts of cruel outrages done by the brethren of the Order in Samogitia
I have already said in Cracow, the imperial privileges are not outrages
The charter says The Order of the Blessed Virgin is granted Lithuania, Prussia, Ruthenia and, in general all lands of the schismatics, which it can reach with its flags
That emperor was very generous indeed where the property of others was involved
May God forgive you this mockery
The emperor on earth is God's deputy where secular power is involved
His concern is to widen the areas of Christianity
We pray for the soul and eternal peace for your queen Jadwiga.
As long as she was alive there was harmony between us
The laws of the Holy Father were recognised and those of the emperors and their faithful servant, the Order, as well
Let us pray for peace for those living on earth
We are aware you prepare yourselves for war against the Order
We know your king ordered big hunting to take place further, that salted meat in barrels be prepared for the army
We ask you frankly, which side will you take when we proceed to Lithuania to defend our affairs to punish Samogitia for the godless rebellions
It is the Order that is a menace to Samogitia and Lithuania
Will you enter into an alliance with pagans?
Pax, pax among Christians
You are our guests
We have good will to listen to your complaints and to consider them
And it is our desire to entertain you with due respect
We want to entertain you as neighbours and friends
We have two infallible means to meet our enemies with a tower full of gold upstairs and iron which is forged downstairs
Just look...
The iron is excellent indeed...
But you do a lot of harm with this iron
- The Order is pious and just
- You said just, right?
And what fate met Jurand's daughter and that young knight?
What about the outrage done to Sieur de Lorche?
Does the Order have means to prevent it?
Sir, proceed to the Grand Master and lodge your complaint
And you also, sir
Welcome, Sieur de Lorche
How is that possible that we see you alive?
We have been told by the Commander of Szczytno that you have been attacked on the way to Cracow and killed
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd attacked me because I wanted to warn the Duke of Mazovia and this knight of Bogdaniec that they were going to kidnap the daughter of Jurand of Spychow
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd are dead
If they have done this crime against a guest of the Order Heaven has punished them justly
But neither the maid nor her father have been found
Jurand shed the knights' blood in Szczytno
He must suffer the punishment he deserves
Defenceless, he rushed upon people who kidnapped his daughter just as they once killed his wife
Your people deprived him of everything dearest to him
Various and wrong things happen on the borders
There is plenty of wickedness on both sides
I cannot believe that brothers from Szczytno acted in a way that did not conform to the vocation of monks and with the honour of German knights
This matter has to be thoroughly investigated
What about the annexation of ships for Lithuania.
You can't believe it either?
These vessels shipped arms for Witold.
Weapons against the Order
- There were no arms there
- There were.
You can see it
One weapon is like another
You say the Order is lying?
And do you believe your own words?
We shall return to this problem tomorrow
Concerning this girl, I shall give you a safe conduct letter to Szczytno and a monastery clerk, to accompany you
Thank you, sir
- What is the matter with you, sir?
- I can't breathe
I'm suffocating.
Take me out of here
Have you heard the complaint of this young knight and Sieur de Lorche's testimony?
Why do those who are posted on the border commanderies bring only shame upon the Order?
Jagiello requests the return of the ships and the exchange of prisoners
Jagiello enters into an alliance with the pagans
Whoever raises to destroy the Poles, deserves salvation
Christ, our Lord converted with words and not with swords
I warn you, brethren, the Order proceeds in an unjust manner far too often
There are rumours that the Prussians are rebelling
German towns are rising against us
Are we to wait till paganism and heresy absorb Christianity?
Idleness means perdition
Sometimes I think that war means perdition
Because you are ill and weak, Gracious Brother
We shall summon the most distinguished knights from all over Europe
We shall make known that those who will destroy the Poles and their king will deserve eternal life
What do you want?
In God's name, war!
- War!
- War!
War!
I tell you once more in the last hour of my life if the good of the Order is the concern of yours, be patient
Do not make war now
Poland, Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia will overthrow us
Give them back the ships...
What does that mean?
Sanderus
What are you doing here?
Be quiet, Gracious Lord.
The brethren should not learn we know each other
I've been to Szczytno.
Your damsel is there
How do you know?
From the chaplain, who is an honest man
She is watched now by Commander Zygfryd de Love
He did her no harm, for once.
When he wanted to do her wrong something pushed him down the staircase, he fainted and almost died
And now he is afraid of her
Do you hear, my Lord, the Grand Master died
What did you say?
The Grand Master died?
Yes, sir.
People say that now they will elect Ulrich the late Master's brother, God grant him everlasting rest
Thus, war is inevitable
I wish you, my Lord, that you may rule with justice, reason and in peace
We are here not for peace's sake but to fight for the faith against pagans and heathens
You have none to fight with, Gracious Lord for you are surrounded by Christian peoples only
True Christians do not support the faithless
What answer have we to take back to our king?
Will the ships with grain be given back to us?
Ships with weapons will become our legal booty
May I remind you, Gracious Lord about the promise made by your late brother and ask you for the safe-conduct letter to Szczytno?
The crew of Szczytno, with de Love set out to fight the rebellious Samogitia
You will find nobody there.
Wait until quieter times
Are you leaving, sir?
Perhaps it is better this way, for I can smell war here
That's true.
Zygfryd de Love and his crew set out for Samogitia
- I will search for him there
- You, for him, and I, for your damsel
He certainly hid her somewhere, to leave no trace
Give me, sir, one purse more and I will proceed from castle to castle and although this is dangerous, maybe I will learn something
Take it and go
It is time for us to bid farewell, sir
I wish you success in your noble search
If you have no objections, sir I would like to announce that Jagienka of Zgorzelice is the fairest and most virtuous lady in the world
Announce it wherever you wish, my Lord.
Perhaps it is even true
Jagienka
Back from Cracow already?
Have you heard something about Zbyszko?
I feel so restless.
The king's deputies came back without him from Malbork
- We were among the Teutonic Knights
- To look for something he'll never find
I have hardly begun to administer here and now I have to go
Among these scoundrels, the fate of Jurand or Danusia may befall him
- Take me with you.
I will help you
- You will help me indeed
You think when you cast off your skirt you will grow wiser
Wisdom is in the head.
Do you want Cztan or Wolf to take me?
They will not take you.
I made them both swear it Cztan, that he will defend you against Wolf and Wolf, that he will not give you to Cztan
Lord Jesus did not spare your cunningness
Everything will always be as you wish
If it were so, you would have long since been mistress of Bogdaniec
Why do you kiss me?
I am only saying goodnight.
We must start at dawn tomorrow
- Are you not afraid to go there?
- I am not.
I want to be near Zbyszko
If Danusia is lost, Zbyszko will be so grieved that he will not look at you
I do not want him to look at me.
I only want to be near him
Look at this giant
- That is no knight for he is going on foot
- He must be blind
He does not even have a dog.
We cannot leave him without help
Do you understand Christian language, old man?
- Get up
- What is the matter with you?
Can you speak?
He is trying to show that they have torn his tongue out
Who did that to you?
The Knights of the Teutonic Order
Are you from here?
From Mazovia?
What were you doing among the Teutonic Knights?
Do you come from Szczytno?
Were you not seeking your child there?
Then, you are Jurand of Spychow
The lord?
Teutonic Knights?
Let's go against the dog's brothers!
Will you fight against the peasants?
They are not the guilty ones
The Knights sit in their fortalices now
We will catch the Germans and throw them at our lord's feet
I am the uncle of Zbyszko of Bogdaniec and until he returns I give the orders here
- The lord went away two days ago
- Where to?
To the Samogitian frontier to search for the young lady
- The war is raging there.
- Then we missed one another
Hlawa?
Where is the lord?
- He keeps on discussing...
- Good...
Uncle.
What are you doing here?
I have been looking for you all over the world and at last I've found you
You thought I will sit in Bogdaniec till the end of my days
Jurand is in Spychow
The Teutonic Knights blinded him, tore out his tongue and cut off his right hand
Dreadful
And you?
Did you accomplish anything?
Have you found Danusia?
- No
- No?
This is my uncle, a knight from Bogdaniec
He has no equal on the battlefield
- Welcome, sir, be seated...
- Welcome
We want to attack the Germans
Two days ago we were near the castle at Nowe Kowno and they defeated us
- Defeated?
- Defeated...
We consider if it would be better to wait near Nowe Kowno, or go to Regneta
- Where is Nowe Kowno?
- About two miles from here
- And Regneta?
- Far northwards
It is good that it is far.
The Germans are not expecting us there
He is right
Exactly.
In the vicinity of Nowe Kowno they already defeated us
Because of that, they do not expect any attack
But Regneta is certainly less well-guarded
- He is right
- Where shall we make the ambush?
Here, near Nowe Kowno
You shall take position in the thickets above the highway and wait for the reinforcements on their way to the castle
200 people will not take part in the battle.
They will retreat
- I will attack from behind
- Cunning
The Teutonic Knights march and hide in a column
You can't destroy the columns with your bellies, can you?
You are wrong, uncle
It is the most courageous nation in the world
They are joyful, the accursed dogs
- At them!
- Attack!
Bind him.
Bind him
It's an important knight...
De Lorche
I recognised you
By the holy bones of St. Laurence.
I implore you, where is de Love?
- He escaped
- Is Jurand's daughter with him?
Jurand's daughter?
There is only an idiot-girl they had shown Jurand in Szczytno
How do you know it is an idiot-girl?
I heard her only, for she is ill and does not leave her wicker litter
Zygfryd had nothing to do with the kidnapping
- Right, yes!
- He is a faithful servant of the Order
And he was not aware of Rotgier and Godfryd's crimes
- Where have they escaped to?
- I do not know
It was agreed, in case we were attacked by somebody Zygfryd and his men will withdraw into a safe place till the battle ends
- Hear this?
- My Lord!
My Lord and defender, save me
But for you, the wolves would have devoured me or I would have fallen into the hands of those sons of Satan
My Lord, tell them to give me something to drink else you will be burdened with my innocent soul
Here, you drunkard
- Christ, our Lord, that is but mare's milk
- Then don't drink it
Thank you for taking me under your protection
You never refuse me any money or drink better than this mare's milk, which disgusts me but of which I will drink some more just to show that a pious pilgrim drinks from no mortification
Stop fooling around and tell me, do you know about Danusia?
Just a moment...
I have come to love you, Lord
When misfortune came upon you, I told myself I have to help you
Suffice to say that I found her and from that moment I have stuck to commander Zygfryd de Love as a bur sticks to a dog's tail...
- Is Danusia still alive?
- She is
He carries her in a wicker litter, fastened between two horses
That's the idiot-girl.
I told you de Love became odd after his son's death
What idiot-girl?
You told yourself, my Lord that your damsel has a lute
- Where are they?
- Certainly somewhere in the vicinity
De Love led the reinforcements which were marching towards Nowe Kowno
When he saw he fell into an ambush, he ordered a withdrawal
- Where could they find shelter?
- I do not know...
Perhaps by the potter deep in the woods, where we recently stopped
- To horses!
- Wait!
Wait!
Give me a horse I will ride ahead and will tell them I escaped from captivity
It will be safer this way.
I might be of some use to your damsel when you will attack Zygfryd de Love's men
Sir, don't believe that drunkard
Give him a horse.
He didn't betray me before, he will not betray me now
Sanderus
He purposely took their swords and cuirasses
- You take Zygfryd, he must be in the hut
- Good
- And I'll take that knight
- Yes
Hlawa...
You watch Danusia
- Forward
- Help
Bind him!
Bind him!
- What is the matter with you?
- Help me to my feet
Hold this
Danusia.
Danusia
- I am afraid
- Danusia.
It is me, Zbyszko
- I am afraid
- Danusia
It is me, Zbyszko.
Danusia
Danusia.
Danusia.
Danusia...
Let go of me.
I'll kill him like a dog
Scoundrel.
Would you stab a bound captive?
Danusia.
Do you recognise me?
Danusia
I am frightened
Listen, bitch, you'll dress the lady in clean garments and you will dress yourself in the rags which you have made her wear hitherto
Then we will choose a branch for you
- Danusia!
Defend me, help me!
- Get out!
Leave her alone!
They brought her to this state by torment
There you have the nobility of your Zygfryd
Take him and go to Spychowo.
Throw him to Jurand's legs
Let Jagienka know Danusia is ill and we have to ride slowly.
Go on
True, my Lord, your life in Poland is more difficult and complicated than I imagined living in Lorraine
Oh, yes.
You'll have to make the choice, my Lord
We can give you a guide to Cracow if you want to stay with us if not, the way to Malbork stays open
Farewell, my Lord, God willing, I will see you sometime again
Hey!
Take him
I was asked, Gracious Lord, to bring you Zygfryd de Love
Before you, my Lord, stands that hellhound, that Teutonic werewolf who tortured you and destroyed your child
Let me know what I am to do with him and how I am to punish him
To your knees, dog
What are you doing, sir?
You will not let this Beelzebub go, sir?
Do you want to give the captive his freedom?
Do you want him to go without vengeance and punishment?
For this purpose we chased him all over the world
He belongs to him.
He can do with him whatever he wants
Lord, if your will is to be fulfilled the captive must be conducted to the border
Here is our border and it is not far to yours
If the divine thunderbolt does not choke and blast you there is no danger to you from men
Go free
Stop!
- The flowers smell sweet
- Danusia
- Where am I?
- Near Spychow
Danusia, wait.
Oh merciful Jesus, wait, wait!
Danusia!
I sought her until I found her and rescued her but she preferred to go to God rather than to Spychow
So young, and death has mown her down
War!
War!
The dawn is not far off
The battle is about to begin
Repeat once more my orders!
You, Grand Duke!
The Lithuanian forces are on the right wing near Stebark
You, brother Ligngwan
The Smolensk companies are to be situated near the Polish wing the Mscislaw one in the middle of the Lithuanian forces and the Nowogrod regiment stays with me
And your men, Khan Dzelal-Eddin?
My men will go together with the Lithuanians
What about you, Jan of Lamberk?
The Czech companies will proceed with the Smolensk ones the rest of them together with Poles
And you, Lord Marshall?
According to your orders, Gracious King 60 men form your guard
The Cracow company will go in the middle of the left wing near Lodwigowe followed by companies from Sieradz and Poznan
I ordered to dig loop holes in front of our lines and to conceal them thoroughly
When the Polish heavy cavalry falls into these holes then our archers and our cannons will easily hit them for the bodies will make an excellent mark
Further, the knights' cavalry will attack from both sides
And what if the Poles will not advance first?
Jagiello is a reasonable leader
Jagiello and Witold are cunning and shrewd
But they are totally lacking the European knightly arts and customs
Their people lack the soldiers discipline they get excited easily, they will certainly first attack us
No.
The heavy armed knights will enter the battle at last
As first the Tartars and the light Lithuanian cavalry will proceed
The Lithuanians and Tartars, with their skins and wooden shields will not resist the pressure of the Teutonic Knight clad in steel armour
But the Lithuanians and Tartars will make a reconnaissance to check if no ambush was prepared.
I know this is dangerous
We conquered in all battles using our stratagem
We shall crush them at once with our heavy horses and equipment
We shall take every precaution
First the loop holes, then cannons and archers and at the end, I shall lead 16 squadrons myself
I shall fight together with you
As it is fitting for a true knight
The leader should not go into the fighting crowd because he will not be able to command
According to eastern customs, the leader commands on a hill in order to see the whole battlefield
Right you are, Grand Duke
True, in the East they use to fight like this
The sun is already up...
It's time to take our positions.
Lead out the men-at-arms
No.
They will wait in the woods.
Do not hurry
It will be easier to form the rank and bear the heavy armour in the shadow
You want us to hide in the bushes
We want to fight openly, as it befits true knights
- I will not stop my warriors
- You will wait!
Even you will not stop them, Gracious Lord.
What do you bid us to do?
You will obey my orders.
Wait!
Let Father Bartosz prepare for Mass.
Two Masses
And you will wait in the woods!
Let us greet the sun
How many of the pagans are hiding in the woods?
I suppose about one hundred thousand
Thus, it will be the biggest battle of our times
We do not know how big their forces are
But they had never before brought together such power
Perhaps about one hundred thousand
What is the name of the village in front of the camp of the Teutonic Knights?
Grunwald...
Before these barbarians form ranks, we will occupy the best positions
And there look there, brethren, the guests of the Order occupy their positions
The flower of the European knighthood
The rest is in God's hands
He will support His faithful servants
The rest is in God's hands.
He will support His faithful servants
Gracious Lord, the Germans are marching
To arms, brethren!
The task will be bloody but we will secure the rule of Christianity in the East for a millennium
The Grand Master of the Order
My Lords, let us go to Mass
Gracious Lord.
With the Knights of the Teutonic Order
The knights from Bavaria, Swabia and France
Cancel the Mass.
Give me a horse
My king, the knights from Rhineland, from Frisian England
They hide in the woods
They are better at handling spoons than swords...
You do not know them.
The Poles do not lack courage but their king is hoping to receive the offer of peace at the last minute
Shame.
The whole power of the Order is afraid of the Poles
I prefer death and so I will be quite alone
I will charge the Polish army with these swords
This is contrary to discipline
Advise me how to draw the enemy out of the woods
King.
The heralds of the Teutonic Order are riding towards our camp
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold, to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
Grand Master Ulrich bids us also to inform you that if the field of battle seems too small for you he will withdraw his armies somewhat so that you need not loiter in the thickets
We have enough swords, but we will take these as an omen of victory
Couriers...
Withdraw the heavy squadrons, they are not the first to enter.
Stop!
Stop!
It is the king's order, turn back
Stop!
You do not enter first.
Stop!
Turn back!
It is the king's order.
Turn back, turn back!
Couriers to Duke Witold, to Dzebal Eddin
Lithuania!
Calisia and Sieradz groups support the right flank!
Advance to aid Masovia!
Choragiew in peril!
We will make a circuit and charge in a flank
Zyndram, let the infantry attack
- At them!
Attack!
- At the enemy!
- Forward!
- At them!
Kuno Lichtenstein, do you recognise me?
Yes, I do
I vowed that I would find you and meet you
Stand!
- To the death, with no quarter
- Stand!
Take off the helmet
Stand your ground, you dog!
That is he, who this very morning thought himself superior to all the powers of the earth
Jagna?
Jagna!
The End
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage, which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER
- Whom are you carrying with you?
- Who are you?
Out of the way!
Lower your lance, knave
- This is Count Jurand of Spychow
- Save us, oh Lord
We are merchants from Plock.
We carried grain from the mill
They broke the Order's laws
Traffic is allowed here only upon the consent of Commander Zygfryd de Lowe
I am the master here.
Let them go
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pious Commander.
We detained the Polish carts loaded with grain
But we were attacked later on
- By whom?
- By Jurand of Spychow
Father, give us your permission
Danusia.
Danusia
Danusia!
Close the gates.
The gates
It's raining.
It's raining
Thank you, oh Lord, for saving us
Open the gates
Teutonic Knights
- Are you Jurand's woman?
- I am master of Spychow's wife
Mother.
O, my mother
Mother!
I will take vengeance over you, my wife.
I will
- You there, innkeeper
- Yes, sir?
Clear the tables and bring in the candles Duchess Anna Danuta is stopping here for a rest
Magda, Magda, clear the tables.
Out with you, beggars.
Go away!
This company is too distinguished for us
Let us go
Be seated, young boar
It is not too distinguished for us.
We are gentle-folk
Hey, Danusia rejoice our hearts with the same song you sang at Zator
- Who is that?
- A maiden from the duchess' court
I thought she was an angel.
What do they call her?
Danusia.
Her father is Jurand of Spychow.
She is an orphan
Why, Jurand is still alive
The Knights of the Teutonic Order killed her mother
Jurand was out hunting when they came to Spychow
A German with a peacock feather on his helmet tied her to his saddle
She turned pale and died on the rope
There is Danusia's knight
Thank you
Worshipful lady, I wish to make my vow to that maiden
Do you wish her to be your lady?
But who are you?
That is my nephew, worshipful lady, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
- And you, sir?
- I am Macko of Bogdaniec
We were in Lithuania, fighting under the command of your brother, Duke Witold
- Were you wounded?
- No.
But we took splendid booty
Are you not boasting by any chance?
Let us see that booty
Fighting the knights from the Frisian country we made an agreement
Whoever wins should take the wagons and cuirass of the defeated there were few suits of armour and costly garments for my nephew
Do you want him to be your knight, Danusia?
I do
I vow to tear some peacocks crests from the German helmets like those of the knight who killed your mother had, and lay them at your feet
- Foolish you are, young boar
- I have vowed
The only way to get booty is to fight under Duke Witold against the Tartars
I have to get German crests.
Where shall I find them among the Tartars?
You will find captives there
Who will cultivate the land in Bogdaniec?
- I have vowed
- Because you are stupid
Duchess Ryngalla poisoned the duke and she was absolved
- We have enough money
- I have vowed
Where will you find the German crests?
Where?
Lower your lance...
Madman.
It is Grand Master's envoy to our majesty the king
- Who are you?
- I am Powala of Taczewo, you fool
You insulted our king.
You'll pay for that with your head
I welcome thee, dear Duke and Duchess of Mazovia
I welcome thee, dear brother Lingwen, Duke of Mscislaw and Nowogrod
I welcome thee, noble envoys of the Grand Master
I welcome thee gracious fathers and all the guests at our court in Cracow the Ruthenian boyars and the Polish Knights
Try to win the king's heart.
It is up to him to pardon you or cut your head off
That wild Lithuanian drinks only mare's milk
- Don't you drink, Gracious Lord?
- No.
Springwater only
Thus, you give a good example, Gracious Lord
A still better one is given by those who act nobly
That is you, Gracious Lord
His most worshipful Majesty, the Grand Master of the Blessed Virgin order aimed to let Your Majesty know gracious King, with all due respect and esteem that not only the Lithuanians but also many Poles help the rebelling pagans in Samogitia
Our people and the people from Ruthenia...
We have privileges from the Holy Father
His Holiness Urban IV gave his consent to the Order of the Blessed Virgin to sell agricultural products, but not for profit
We vowed poverty as monks but our Order is compelled to fight with pagans
The Order builds castles, mills
Who can say there is no order and fear of God in the lands belonging to us?
Order and fear of God?
And on the border, steady confusion and fires
But in our land we hold Christian laws in esteem.
We do not insult the envoys
Whom are you referring to, noble knight?
Has somebody insulted you in Poland?
I did, Gracious Lord
If the Teutonic Knight demands punishment, let there be punishment
But Zbyszko is the last in our line.
If he is no more, we shall be no more
Allow me, sir, to give my head for his
Law crushes the guilty, but it is not a dragon which laps the blood of a man without looking whose it is
What about the Teutonic Knights' justice?
Samogitia.
Swords, robbery
- They have privileges granted
- Let's fight them!
It is the booty you are after
We will not expose Poland to a conflict with the Order of the Blessed Virgin
Thus you will cut off my nephews' head?
We will.
We shall act according to the law
Ask Lichtenstein for mercy.
Only he can withdraw his complaint
That is true.
I was wearing my suit of armour
Thus, you could have defended yourself, sir
It is a suit of armour one wears only when paying solemn visits
Piercing this metal plate with a blade would surely deprive one of his life
Was it your intention to kill Squire von Lichtenstein?
It was.
As long as he was alive I could not get the crest
But I called to him from a distance to lower his lance
If he had called that he was an envoy, I would have left him in peace
True.
Why did he not call out?
Can you swear on the Passion of our Lord that you did not see his cloak and the cross?
I cannot.
I should certainly not have attacked our knight
I knew it was a Knight of the Teutonic Order
How could there be any other Teutonic Knight in the vicinity of Cracow, except for an envoy or one of his colour?
Commander von Lichtenstein
- Pardon him
- I do pardon him
From the bottom of my heart, as a servant of Christ and a monk
- Praise be to him
- But I am here as an envoy
So he who has wronged an envoy, has insulted the Order and insulted Christ Himself
And such a wrongdoing I cannot forgive
Kneel down
God... be merciful to me
The noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec is condemned by the Castellan's sentence to be beheaded with the sword
- Danusia
- Don't be mournful.
The Castellan agreed to postpone the execution
- What good will it do?
- Isn't it hard for you?
One week sooner, one later...
- What is the weather like outside?
- The sun is shining
Almighty God!
If I could mount a horse and ride through the vast fields!
It is hard for you...
Sing me a song
If I could be saved, my maiden...
We have to go, my lady
The duchess wrote a letter to the Grand Master
The king will pardon you if the Grand Master intercedes in your favour
Macko went to Malbork with the letter.
May he only arrive in time
Stop.
It is not a Saracen.
Are you a Christian?
I am.
Honestly like a knight and you are like a robber
I am Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine and I joined the Order to fight the Saracens
I thought there are no fools in Lorraine.
Saracens here?
You stupid man.
We have been Christians for ages
What about the Mazurians?
Don't make a fool out of me
I have been shown wooden Mazurian idols in Malbork
Let me give him the last blow.
He is a Mazurian
To arms!
Jurand!
Kill them
Help me.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, please help me
- Spare him.
He's not a Teutonic Knight
- He fought against us
Who are you?
Macko of Bogdaniec.
Whom have I to thank for the rescue?
I am Jurand of Spychow
Jesus...
- Who are you?
- De Bergow.
You must know about me
The pious Commander of Szczytno will offer a ransom for me
- We are in Spychow
- You are Jurand
I don't take ransoms
No Teutonic Knight will leave this place on his own feet
Bind him in chains and put him in the dungeon
- And what about him, sir?
- I am Count de Lorche
He is not a Teutonic Knight.
He is a knight from Lorraine
They came here to fight Saracens.
You offered him to me, sir
What will you do with him?
My nephew's life is in the hands of the Grand Master
I was on my way to Malbork with a letter from the Duchess of Mazovia and he wounded me
Let him pay for it now
A splinter is sticking between your ribs.
There's not much time left for you
I cannot help it...
I must go to Cracow
Now I shall not escape death.
They'll cut off my head
Most certainly.
But don't be mournful
I will have such an oak coffin made for you that even the lords of the crown have no better
I won't even allow them to behead you on the same cloth they use for the townsfolk
I have already agreed with the merchant Amyley to give you a quite new one, scarlet good enough for the king to use to line his fur coat with
And I won't grudge you masses.
Never fear
God reward you, uncle
- Uncle?
- Yes, Zbyszko?
- I want you to make me a promise
- A promise?
When they cut my head off, take a mighty woman for yourself
What?
Are you mad?
You said it yourself.
Our line must not die out
- Look.
Do you see?
- Do you spit blood like that all the time?
A splinter two inches long is sticking between my ribs
I am going to die before winter comes
- Only you yourself can save your life
- What?
Have you heard about Duke Witold?
How he was imprisoned in Krewa and escaped disguised in women's clothes?
Now, take my leather jacket, take my hood and go, understand?
Here you have the ransom the Teutons paid for this de Lorche from Lorraine...
Then they'll cut off your head instead of mine
Good for them.
I'll die anyway in two or three weeks' time
- Take it
- I won't do that
I wish you had never been born
Listen it was not a shame for Duke Witold to escape in that way it will not be a shame for you
Duke Witold is a grand duke
He has received a crown from the king's hands, he has wealth and lordship
And I, poor nobleman, have nothing but my honour
Don't you understand that I love you and won't give your head for mine?
May the cross-wolves perish if children are to be executed through them
Shame, shame...
Stop!
Stop!
He doesn't belong to the headman.
He's mine, he's mine
She threw her veil over him.
It's an old custom.
He is hers
Let's go to the castle.
To the Castellan
Pagan country, pagan customs
It is true.
Such ancient customs exist
But it is more suited to the robbers of the Carpathian foothills and to the simple folk
Ask Father Stanislaw, he knows everything about laws and customs
One should have asked the Grand Master
It was his envoy who was insulted
The ancient, folk customs became law
Gracious Duchess.
The betrothal must take place at once if I am to honour this custom
Gracious Duke, we offer these humble gifts to you, the truly Christian lord and our Order's friend
Don't bear a grudge because of the petty conflicts and quarrels and the inconsiderate and passionate deeds committed by youngsters
You may assure the Grand Master we are his true friends and defenders of our common faith
The pious Grand Commander Zygfryd de Lowe of Szczytno wants to lodge a complaint to be considered by your Serene Highness not because of "youngsters"
Jurand of Spychow, your Serene Highness, attacked our people
He slaughtered and wounded many.
He took brother de Bergow captive
We have here the noble witness, Lord Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine who is the Order's guest
He has also been cruelly injured by Jurand...
Who is this most beautiful maiden in the world?
Fascinating indeed
She is the daughter of Jurand, the man who aimed to kill you
Hot paternal blood
Against a girl like that I'll fight most gladly
Border disputes... the pious knight de Love accuses the Count of Spychow while the noble Jurand accuses the Grand Commander of Szczytno
It is not only this complaint we ask you to consider, your Serene Highness
The Grand Master would like to get acquainted with your opinion concerning the alliance of King Jagiello with the heathens
And with the schismatics from Ruthenia as well
The Grand Master sends you this holy relic the same the gracious Duchess asked for the forefinger of St. Onufry who died a glorious death, killed by the pagans
I told you to go with this mission to Cracow and to negotiate there
- The Duke of Mazovia is benevolent
- But he will not give us Jurand
- Jurand will beg at our gates, my father
- What have you said, my son?
I said, my father, Jurand will come to us on his knees to get his daughter back
- I do not understand
- Do you want to kidnap his daughter?
She is the daughter of the most rancorous enemy of the Order
You barely escaped him with your own life
It does not agree with the knightly gospel and honour
We are destined to live on the borders, in forests
Doomed is the one who is not able to repay a blow with a blow
Listen.
She is still a child.
Don't force me to warn them
- You will not do it, sir
- I will, so help me God...
You won't...
Give him the last blow...
It is not necessary after I worked upon him
Proceed, sir, I will join you
Forgive him, Lord Jesus, his sins and grant him everlasting rest
Why, oh Lord, to spread Thy rule to defend Thy home, we have to make so much injustice
You will certainly not bring me alive to Bogda...
- Water...
- Stampeding horses!
To the woods!
To the woods!
You intruded unnecessarily, I would have managed
- Hlawa.
Take the horse
- Zych
Zych...
At last...
Good gracious
Thus, you returned to your Bogdaniec
- I did, didn't I, just to die here
- What is wrong?
Jagna, it's our neighbour Macko of Bogdaniec
Come here
- Who is that?
- Did you not recognise Zbyszko?
Zbyszko?
Jagna, come here
Quickly.
Give him a kiss, for old times' sake
Am I already at death's door, Father?
I tried to pull out the splinter, but I failed
- He failed.
Zych?
- Yes, brother?
Do you have much land of your own?
Thanks to good husbandry three malets and about 50 men
And Jagna?
Jagna, how old is she?
She is now so attracted to boys that when she sees them she rubs one knee against the other
Zych, you lied, you have 70 men
- What is that to you?
- If Zbyszko takes your Jagna...
Well, well.
Let me hear your confession, it may be too late later
Tell me the truth, as in the face of God.
How many men have you?
- Will he live, sir?
- God willing
But the priest advised to try to heal him with bear's fat
Hlawa.
Have you brought bear's fat?
- No, my lady.
The dogs ate it all up
- I will look for some in the tree-hives
I've been told I could easily find one there
It's dangerous.
Take our Hlawa with you
To frighten the bear away?
No
God have mercy...
Use your axe
- Who are you?
- Jagienka
I don't know what would have happened if it was not for you
Leave me alone.
Will you?
A lad of ours also went with a fork and an axe and the bear tore him to pieces
Thus, I went after you
- Then it was you there under the pines?
- Yes
There cannot be another girl like you in the world
- You ought to go to the war
- Don't laugh at me
Wait.
We'd better get a beaver at once because when the wound opens you have to stop it with beaver's fat and the sickness will leave him
- Where are the beaver's lodges?
- Come
Did you heard me sing, when you laid in wait for the bear?
- It was you?
- Yes
These woods belong to Cztan of Rogow
- The man who would like to marry you?
- If only I would let him!
I've been told that Cztan grinds his teeth at Wolf your other neighbour who would like to marry you too
Oh, yes
- Foolish lads
- Why?
When your father was away one of them should have taken you from Zgorzelice
What if your father had come back and found you with a child?
Let them try.
You think I don't know how to grasp a spear or a crossbow?
I would have driven each of them home again and raided their villages
If I were Cztan or Wolf, I would not be afraid of your father or you
- But I would have taken you
- You would have?
Why should a girl fight with lads when she ought to marry
Don't be stupid.
Be quiet
There are the beavers, in the warm spring
- I've got it, I've got it
- I am going for it
Don't.
The mud is deep.
Anyone unfamiliar with it will certainly drown
- Then how will you get it?
- Don't worry about it.
Let's go
I've left my arrows in the willow.
Wait
- Hey, what a cunning girl you are
- Oh, go away
Squeeze out the water from my plait
- And I was waiting for you like a fool
- Was I to undress in front of you?
- That would be something to marvel at
- Be quiet.
Take the beaver
Give it
- Zbyszko
- Yes?
I will marry neither Cztan nor Wolf
God will give you the best man possible.
You will be worthy of him
In a couple of weeks, Macko will be able to mount a horse
I am waiting for that as for salvation.
It is hard for me to stay here
- Why?
- Were you told about Danusia?
I heard something.
I know she covered you with a veil
I know every knight vows some deed, even the married ones
- But this Danusia, who is she?
- I will tell you, as I would my own sister
For her sake I would cross the ninth river and the ninth sea
I will fulfil what I have vowed to her, unless I die first
- Is it true?
- It is
I did not realise that.
Hlawa...
May God reward you for everything, my girl
Hlawa will help you to get the beavers.
I am going back home
What the deuce!
Who has killed him?
Wait...
He is still breathing.
- It's not worth it.
He'll die in no time
- Let's help him
Leave him.
If he recovers, it will bring us trouble
And so his purse and sword...
He'll reward us happily with the purse when he recovers, and besides we gain merit in heaven for rescuing a Christian.
Let's take him
You fool.
It's a mere loss of time
Go on.
Take him
Perhaps he'll survive
An urgent message for the gracious Duchess from the Count of Spychow
Nothing but bad news.
A part of the fortalice had been burned in Spychow
Jesus
Father Kaleb writes, the Count of Spychow may recover but the sparks and coals so burned his only eye that little light was left in it and he is threatened with blindness
That is why the Count of Spychow...
summons Danusia to come to him for he wants to see her again before darkness overwhelms him
He also humbly thanks the Duchess for raising the girl like a daughter and he promises that he would come to Ciechanow for Christmas to fall at the lady's feet and beg her favour and support for Danusia for the future
Come nearer
I do not know you.
Why hasn't Tolima come?
He was injured in a recent fight with the Germans
The Count begs for the swift return of his daughter since he may be blind soon
Gracious lady, we have to go back as soon as the horses have rested
We shall meet your neighbours, Cztan and Wolf, at Krzesnia
- Show them to me from a distance
- I will, Zbyszko
They will meet you in front of the church.
What will they do?
Attend me as best they know
They will not attend to you today, understand?
That's them
- What now?
- Well, what?
- Shall we at once...
- How can you fall on him in church?
Not in church but after Mass
That's her father.
Do you remember what he said?
If we started a fight he would banish us from Zgorzelice
If it were not for that, I would have broken your ribs long ago
Or I yours
Let's better break his together
- Let's do it
- After Mass
Hurry up
- Woe is me
- To the inn
I have to pay for the mass for my uncle's health.
I'll go back
- We'll send money from Zgorzelice
- I have to go back
Go.
God be with you
If either of you two denies that the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the world is Danusia Jurand of Spychow's daughter I will challenge him to fight on horseback or on foot, until death
What?
You dog's brother.
Jagienka is not the most beautiful
He is mocking
That's what you knights are like?
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
Where is Zbyszko?
He went back to the church.
He forgot to pay for the Mass
Daddy.
Perhaps we will send a couple of lads to Krzesnia?
- What for?
- The quarrel has broken out there
What quarrel?
Whom is he to fight with?
Cztan and Wolf, he'll fight for me
If so, let them fight
- You've done it quickly, how was it?
- I just paid for the Mass
- Haven't you been in the inn?
- I have
- Well, and what happened?
- Nothing
Now my uncle feels better, I shall go to Mazovia
- To Danusia?
- I have vowed
You vowed to get a peacock's crest
I vowed to take her for my wife.
God grant you health and all the best
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
- I am your servant, my Lord
- My servant?
Lady Jagienka of Zgorzelice gave me to you
- Go back home.
I don't want you
- I will not go back, sir
I am a prisoner of war from Boleslawice.
I was given to you
- Thus, you are mine?
- Yours, my Lord
Then, I order you to go back
Lady Jagienka sent you this too
Go away.
Do you want me to break your bones?
- What is your name?
- In Czech, Hlawa.
In Polish, Big Head
Give me the cape
Christians, save a servant of God
Whoever you are, sir, help a servant of God
Who are you?
Sanderus.
My horse ran away, I was left alone without weapons
A wild beast may appear any moment in the forest
I shall perish if you do not save me
Give him a horse
May God multiply your victories, valiant knight
Hey, innkeeper.
We want to wait until the snowstorm is over
Welcome travellers from far away
Get out of here
I am dead-cold.
Order a flask of wine for me
For two or three gulps, I shall excuse you a month in purgatory
He looks like a drunkard
Beware of everlasting damnation.
You are speaking to a man who ate hard-boiled eggs with the Holy Father last Easter
How can you write me off a month of purgatory if you are not ordained?
I have obtained permission to sell pardons and relics
- Where are you from?
- Under the Prussian lords, from Malbork
You speak our language well What do they call you?
I am a German and my name is Sanderus
I was born at Torun, where all folk speak like that
Even the brothers of the Order understand your language
Innkeeper.
Bring warm beer
- Is it long since you left Malbork?
- Long enough
I have been in the Holy Land then I returned to Malbork and now I carry the holy relics and pardons which pious Christians buy for their soul's salvation
Where have you got those holy wares from?
I have plenary pardons, pardons for 500 years, for 300 and cheaper ones, so that even poor people can buy them and thus shorten the pains of purgatory for themselves...
I have pardons for past sins and for the future ones but I don't keep the money I get for them
A piece of black bread and a drink of water is enough for me
The remainder of what I get I take to Rome to help them to collect in time for a new crusade
And these relics?
Are they important ones?
Such that it is not fitting even to talk of them without taking your hat off
I have a shoe of the ass ridden on by the Holy Family on their flight into Egypt
I have a feather from archangel Gabriel's wing which he lost during the Annunciation
I have some of the oil in which the pagans boiled St. John
I have a rung of the ladder Jacob saw in his dreams and a phial containing wind, which was blowing in the Bethlehem stable
Is the storm over?
Why, no, I suppose we will have to spend Christmas Eve here
Saddle the horses.
Let's go
It's very dangerous now, my Lord, the roads are buried in snow
I have to reach the Duke of Mazovia before Christmas Eve
They will wait, my Lord, and here we may lose our way and perish
You can stay here, you drunkard
I can't.
Who will defend my holy goods?
Don't go, my Lord
- We rode off the highway
- I warned you
- Let's go
- The horses will not go on
Everything is going wrong, my Lord.
One can't see the highway any more
There is a man under the snow
It will snow us over too, my Lord
It will snow us over too, it will snow us over
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
It will snow us over!
Some men...
light...
There are some men there
- Hey!
- You there!
Hey!
Hey!
Is anybody there?
Who are you?
The Duke of Mazovia's men.
We have been sent to help travellers
Follow me, there are some people buried there
It is Jurand
Give me a torch
Rub him with snow
Gracious Lord.
Jurand of Spychow has been found under the snow
You found him?
Bring him here
Danusia?
We tried to find her.
Have you left her back at Spychow?
I was going to her, to Ciechanow...
Why, you have sent men with a letter for her.
Wake up!
By God's mercy, where is my child?
Listen.
There came an armed troop with a letter from you saying that you were injured during a fire
Woe to me.
They have seized my child and they will destroy her
Who?
The Teutonic Knights... de Lowe Godfryd...
Rotgier...
- Was it you who dug me out?
- With the others
- Are you going to help me now?
- Your daughter saved me from death
- Do you love her?
- I belong to her forever...
Even if I have to bite Prussian castles with my teeth, I'll get her
Do you know what the vengeance of the brothers of the Order is?
And now to Spychow
My Lord.
Some monks are waiting for you here
They were bustling about Spychow.
They want to speak with you
- Who are you?
- Pilgrims
- Where from?
- From Szczytno
Where is my child?
He who sent us ordered us not to speak with you in the presence of witnesses
I have no secrets before these men
But we have.
If you bid them to stay we will have to depart
Since it has to be so, you remain alone
Your daughter was kidnapped by robbers
With crosses on their cloaks?
No.
But God blessed the brethren, they rescued her and now she is with them
Where?
Under the protection of the pious brother Szomberg
Szomberg.
The one who strangled Witold's children
He takes good care of her and she will not be harmed
What have I to do to get her back?
- Humble yourself before the Order
- Silence!
- Have you a letter?
- No
We say what we have to say
Nothing evil will happen to your daughter.
The brethren will repay you good for evil if you satisfy their just demands
- What do they want?
- Brother de Bergow released
I will release him
And all the other prisoners you still have at Spychow
I will not bargain for my child
But that is not all
To protect the good name of the Order, the brethren add another condition
You will declare to the Duke and to the whole knighthood that it was robbers who kidnapped your daughter and that you had to pay a ransom to get her back
It is true that robbers kidnapped my child and that I must pay a ransom to them to get her back
You will say that you took a ransom from de Bergow to pay the robbers
I have never taken a ransom
For it was never a question of your child
Or do something else
You may come to Szczytno yourself for your daughter
I?
To Szczytno?
For robbers may again kidnap her on the way and the suspicion will fall on the pious brethren
Who will guarantee my return from Szczytno?
The virtue of the brethren, their justice and piety
I will come to Szczytno.
But both of you will stay here until my return and then you will go with Bergow and the prisoners
You don't want to trust the monks so why should they trust you?
Whoever you are, do not test my patience
Say what you were ordered to say
The brethren told us you have to go to Szczytno without saying a word
Did they not tell you I would break you with a wheel in Spychow?
Your daughter is in the hands of the brethren
What did they want?
Tell us
Are you sick, my Lord?
What news of Danusia?
With what proposal have they come?
With a ransom.
For de Bergow
Where is Danusia?
She is not with the Teutonic Knights
Come closer
He is destined for my daughter and thus he is to be lord here after my death
You will serve him faithfully in peace and in war
Have you heard?
Dear God.
Why are you giving me Spychow already?
I am giving you Danusia
The hour of death is unknown
Where is the master?
- What are your grace's commands?
- I ask you where the master is?
- He is gone
- Where to?
I do not know.
He went heavily armed
The highway will be on the right, beyond the woods and from the knoll you'll see the castle at once
From the knoll, you say?
The castle?
You are not a German, sir, are you?
They did not pay their taxes
The brethren need a lot of money for the war with Samogitis
After the war against the Samogitians is over, they will start another one
Fishing is forbidden hunting too...
The tax on milling if very high and if they find a quern in a hut, they don't even spare children or women
- Now you will find the way yourself
- I will
- God reward you, worshipful master
- God be with you
- Who is there?
- Jurand of Spychow
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander Zygfryd de Lowe bids me to say to you that as long as you do not dismount the gates will not be opened
And your weapons are to be given up
Now, by Order of the Commander you have to put on this horse sack to hang the scabbard of your sword from your neck by a rope... and to wait in humility at the gate until the Commander orders it to be opened
My child
On your feet, dog.
The Commander orders you to appear before him
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander bade me to bring you in.
Follow me
- Have you no weapons on you?
- I gave them all up
Beware of bursting into anger.
You are under the force of the Commander
See how the power of the Order conquers malice and pride
- God grants it may always do so
- You bit the Order like a dog
God has caused you to stand before us like a dog with a rope round your neck
Do not compare me with a dog, for you deprive of honour those who have fought with me and perished by my hand
You still spit in pride
I am deprived of pride
By shaming my knighthood, you have shamed yourself
Do not complain that you have been shamed
Though you have been made a kennel man it is better to be the Order's kennel man than one of your knights
By the Passion of the Redeemer and everlasting Salvation, give me back my child as you promised
- Who promised you?
- You did
Commander
The word of a Knight of the Order is to be esteemed as the word of God
How so?
Will you not only let the girl go but also this mad dog to bite us anew?
I trusted Godfryd with this matter.
Be calm, my son
Well, you wolf.
You lapped our blood and now we pay you good for evil
I was hard on you but I was never treacherous
Here you have your child
This is not my daughter.
It is not her
It is not your daughter?
By St. Liborius of Paderborn it means it wasn't your child we rescued from the robbers for there is no other in Szczytno
There is.
I heard her sing
We are all witnesses that we are giving back the girl the robbers thought was Jurand of Spychow's daughter.
If that is not your daughter it is no fault of ours but the will of our Lord
God looks upon your treachery
By the wound of the Redeemer, by the hour of our death, ...give me back my child
If we give her back to you it will be with a bastard of mine
Spare him!
- On what are we taking counsel?
- On our defeat
On what the Grand Master and the Chapter will say and on the means of preventing our actions from harming our Order
- It still smells of blood here
- I ordered the floor to be washed
Where is brother Godfryd's body?
In the chapel.
The brethren are chanting litanies
- Where are the other corpses?
- In the snow to get them stiffened
- Is Jurand alive?
- He is alive
The soldiers wanted to finish him off but the Chaplain did not let them
It was a fatal idea to kidnap Jurand's daughter
Nobody will accuse us if the girl disappears
Pure reason speaks through brother Rotgier's mouth
Then even the Pope or the Roman emperor can take us to court
- What shall we do with the girl?
- Give her to me
No, my son.
When the Order is in question, renounce pleasure
Harden your hearts
Godfryd was reached by the hand of God for he desired not only to avenge the wrongs of the Order, but also to satisfy his own lust
The time is near when the Order will be put to severe test
That is an evil night
You, brother de Bergow, will go to the Grand Master of Malbork
You have groaned in captivity with Jurand so they will more readily believe you
Say that before we entangled this madman in a net he managed to kill nine men and among them brother Godfryd
- God grant him everlasting rest
- Amen
And tell him that although we wanted to subdue an enemy of the Order yet none here was the first to draw sword against Jurand
I shall tell everything my eyes have seen
Are you quite certain Rotgier that nobody will learn the truth about Jurand's daughter?
Besides Godfryd, the both of us and the woman servant who watches her nobody knows we have her here
Godfryd ordered the men who brought her here to be hanged
Good
What will you do with Jurand's daughter?
I shall do whatever the good of the Order may require
Have you courage in your heart, my son?
Can you doubt it?
I do not doubt it
For your valiancy, I love you more than anyone in the world
Go then to Duke of Mazovia's court and tell him what happened here as we agreed between us
That's dangerous
It's for the good of the Order
But what if Jurand survives and regains his freedom?
Even though he regains his freedom he will never utter a word of complaint against the Order
Mindful of the Divine command we did not want to slay him although he slew many of our men, first of all brother Godfryd
At last we had to entangle him in a net then he raised the weapon and injured himself terribly
That night people in Szczytno heard laughter and voices calling in the air the enemy of the Cross, the shedder of innocent blood, our Jurand
You say you summoned Jurand to Szczytno?
Yes, gracious lady, when we rescued the crippled girl from the robbers we thought it was Jurand's daughter
How could you think that when you had seen Jurand's real daughter with me in Cracow?
We monks do not raise our eyes to women
Also, there were many maids with the gracious Duchess in Cracow
How did you know about the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
The audacity and godlessness of this deed made it known also among us
It is strange you would take the idiot-girl for Jurand's daughter
Perhaps Satan changed her
But robbers could not imitate Jurand's seal or the writing of his priest.
Who could do that?
An evil spirit.
These questions are like swords in my breast for suspicion is concealed behind them
I ask you, did Jurand himself accuse us of this deed?
His letter is available
That is true, there is Jurand's letter concerning robbers
See how the light of truth vanquishes darkness
Reward our losses and our blood, my Lord.
He was your subject
What do you want?
Jurand attacked you in madness.
Have I to be responsible for it?
My Lord, his land and fort in which he imprisoned servants of the Order, lie in your duchy
Let at least that become, henceforth, the Order's property
That payment will not bring our dead brothers to life but perhaps it will appease the divine anger and wipe out the disgrace
Haven't you got enough?
All these countries Eastern Pommerania, Prussia, the Chelmno county which belonged to us and are yours today
Jurand's daughter is still alive
For no-one has told us of her death and you want to rob her dowry
Jurand shed the blood of the brethren of the Order
You admitted the wrong, my Lord
So recompense us as your ducal conscience and your spirit of justice bids you
I come here as the Knight of the Most Holy Virgin ready to defend the honour of the Order with my own blood
If there is anyone, despite what Jurand said who dares to suspect the Order of kidnapping his daughter let him take up this knightly gage and venture on the wager of God's judgement
Is there anyone who will pick up that glove?
I will
Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
I take God as my witness, you, my distinguished Lord and the whole knighthood of this land that I am innocent of this blood that will be shed
They were men in combat according to law and custom in a knightly and proper manner
- Is he back?
- Not yet
But don't trouble yourself, commander for it is a judgement of God
- Judgement of God?
- Brother Rotgier is a famous knight
- But he should already be here
- He will return covered in new glory
Go and see who that is
Take the body to the chapel
Thus, they have sent him back
Is brother Rotgier already in the chapel?
Yes
Tell Diederich to come here with the keys and the lantern...
My coat
Let him also bring a brazier with charcoal
Dear son...
And you wrote to me that he was almost a child...
The whole arm
Many times you raised it for the Order's glory and now a Polish axe has hewn it off
The Lord did not bless you
Perhaps he does not care anymore for our Order
He has abandoned me also, although I have served Him my whole life
No, no, this is not possible, for we are in the right
Ours is the just cause
I do love you my son, and you will never speak again
Wait.
I will make you happy
Ready?
Once you told what brother Godfryd had ordered you to do and you lost your tongue
So, I tell you, that if with a single movement you show what you have done by my order, I will have you hanged
Do you understand?
Go on
On your knees, you dog
Get out
Light
You were promised that you would go free but the tongue with which you blasphemed will be torn out
Brother Rotgier is waiting.
I promised him to lay your right hand in his coffin
You still have one eye left
I only had you and now I have no-one
Listen, dear son, I vow to you I will lay the hand which slew you on your grave or perish myself
But before I get him I will make him suffer worse
He will not see that girl again
Who is there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Once I knelt under the headman's axe for I raised my sword against the Knights of the Order
Let the headsman cut off my head because I am going to raise it again
The Knights of the Order kidnapped Danusia
They drew Jurand into a trap
I will go alone and perish under their walls
Let the world know about the wrongs done by them
Order my head cut off but defend them, intercede for them with the Grand Master
Stop it.
Have you proved Jurand and his daughter were lured into a trap?
- Who else could have done it, my lord?
- Have you any witnesses?
Gracious lord, I have been informed that in the woods in Carpathia in a hut belonging to simple charcoal-burners Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine was lying wounded
I sincerely apologise, worshipful king, I am not able to make due homage
They stabbed me in my back and the wound has not healed
What has this to do with kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
I testify, gracious lord, that the monks from Szczytno discussed the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter
They stabbed me on the road like a wild boar because I wanted to prevent that mean trick
Will you repeat it in the presence of the Grand Master?
I witnessed here in Cracow against Jurand and now when the justice demands it I will witness against the monks from Szczytno...
Gracious lord...
Sir, accept my homage and my deep gratitude
Are you Zbyszko of Bogdaniec?
The most humble homage to the knight of the most beautiful girl in the world
If you deny it I will have to challenge you to combat on foot or on horse
Duchess Anna Danuta
Who is she, that most beautiful lady in the world?
Jagienka.
I can hardly believe my own eyes you look so beautiful.
How come you are in court?
My father has died.
The duchess agreed most kindly to protect me but I am always longing for Zgorzelice
Uncle, you are also here?
I have always told you, young boar, that she is like a deer, haven't I?
Noble Lord, the king asks you to come
Excuse me, sir
I have one more piece of bad news for you, my Lords
The Knights of the Teutonic Order robbed the ships loaded with grain which we sent to Lithuania
They spread rumours we supplied the Samogitians with arms
What does Jungingen want?
To sell our grain to the Lithuanians or start the war?
Is war inevitable?
Can we let them conquer Samogitia, Lithuania?
Will they stop after that?
The Order is an unconquered power
True, we will perish if we allow them to surprise us in a single battle
In alliance with Lithuania, Ruthenia and other peoples, we will win
Gracious Lord have I to speak truly or beautifully?
Do tell the truth, Castellan
Do you bid us, my king, to enter into an alliance with pagans and eastern schismatics against the Order?
Such plans do not correspond with a Christian leader
To weaken the Order means to weaken Christianity
You were to tell the truth, Castellan.
Do I want war?
Who blocks the way to overseas countries for our grain?
Who annexed Eastern Pommeranie?
If war breaks out, it will be a most cruel one and that is why we already think about the necessary preparations
But first we shall try to mitigate the matter
Castellans, Gracious Lords we shall summon the Order to give us back the ships with grain
Our envoys shall go to Malbork
How you have changed...
Sieur de Lorche would like to ask you, sir, whether that young lady is a mortal being or is she perhaps and angel?
Tell Sieur de Lorche it is an angel who chose a devilishly beautiful bodily cover for the time it stay among the mortals
Please, don't Zbyszko
What about Danusia?
Are there any news?
I do not know...
We are going to Malbork
The Gracious Lord agreed that you join us
Thank you, sir
- Uncle
- Yes...
- Jurand burdened me with Spychow
- Yes
In case I did not come back from Malbork please go to Spychow and defend the castle...
And who will dwell in Bogdaniec?
Just look at him.
He has a girl, who would crush all the nuts spread on the bench if she sat on them!
And he goes away into the world!
I beg you to do me this favour
If I am not back soon, go to Spychow
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Welcome Polish Knights
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Brother, lead the noble Polish lords and conceal nothing
Are these prisoners of war?
These are wretched rebels, heretics and pagans
They work here for the glory of God
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
My heart is full of joy, Gracious Lords that we sit together at one table, as it is fitting for good Christians...
Let us not allow the Samogitians to incite war between the Order and your king...
There is proof of all sorts of cruel outrages done by the brethren of the Order in Samogitia
I have already said in Cracow, the imperial privileges are not outrages
The charter says The Order of the Blessed Virgin is granted Lithuania, Prussia, Ruthenia and, in general all lands of the schismatics, which it can reach with its flags
That emperor was very generous indeed where the property of others was involved
May God forgive you this mockery
The emperor on earth is God's deputy where secular power is involved
His concern is to widen the areas of Christianity
We pray for the soul and eternal peace for your queen Jadwiga.
As long as she was alive there was harmony between us
The laws of the Holy Father were recognised and those of the emperors and their faithful servant, the Order, as well
Let us pray for peace for those living on earth
We are aware you prepare yourselves for war against the Order
We know your king ordered big hunting to take place further, that salted meat in barrels be prepared for the army
We ask you frankly, which side will you take when we proceed to Lithuania to defend our affairs to punish Samogitia for the godless rebellions
It is the Order that is a menace to Samogitia and Lithuania
Will you enter into an alliance with pagans?
Pax, pax among Christians
You are our guests
We have good will to listen to your complaints and to consider them
And it is our desire to entertain you with due respect
We want to entertain you as neighbours and friends
We have two infallible means to meet our enemies with a tower full of gold upstairs and iron which is forged downstairs
Just look...
The iron is excellent indeed...
But you do a lot of harm with this iron
- The Order is pious and just
- You said just, right?
And what fate met Jurand's daughter and that young knight?
What about the outrage done to Sieur de Lorche?
Does the Order have means to prevent it?
Sir, proceed to the Grand Master and lodge your complaint
And you also, sir
Welcome, Sieur de Lorche
How is that possible that we see you alive?
We have been told by the Commander of Szczytno that you have been attacked on the way to Cracow and killed
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd attacked me because I wanted to warn the Duke of Mazovia and this knight of Bogdaniec that they were going to kidnap the daughter of Jurand of Spychow
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd are dead
If they have done this crime against a guest of the Order Heaven has punished them justly
But neither the maid nor her father have been found
Jurand shed the knights' blood in Szczytno
He must suffer the punishment he deserves
Defenceless, he rushed upon people who kidnapped his daughter just as they once killed his wife
Your people deprived him of everything dearest to him
Various and wrong things happen on the borders
There is plenty of wickedness on both sides
I cannot believe that brothers from Szczytno acted in a way that did not conform to the vocation of monks and with the honour of German knights
This matter has to be thoroughly investigated
What about the annexation of ships for Lithuania.
You can't believe it either?
These vessels shipped arms for Witold.
Weapons against the Order
- There were no arms there
- There were.
You can see it
One weapon is like another
You say the Order is lying?
And do you believe your own words?
We shall return to this problem tomorrow
Concerning this girl, I shall give you a safe conduct letter to Szczytno and a monastery clerk, to accompany you
Thank you, sir
- What is the matter with you, sir?
- I can't breathe
I'm suffocating.
Take me out of here
Have you heard the complaint of this young knight and Sieur de Lorche's testimony?
Why do those who are posted on the border commanderies bring only shame upon the Order?
Jagiello requests the return of the ships and the exchange of prisoners
Jagiello enters into an alliance with the pagans
Whoever raises to destroy the Poles, deserves salvation
Christ, our Lord converted with words and not with swords
I warn you, brethren, the Order proceeds in an unjust manner far too often
There are rumours that the Prussians are rebelling
German towns are rising against us
Are we to wait till paganism and heresy absorb Christianity?
Idleness means perdition
Sometimes I think that war means perdition
Because you are ill and weak, Gracious Brother
We shall summon the most distinguished knights from all over Europe
We shall make known that those who will destroy the Poles and their king will deserve eternal life
What do you want?
In God's name, war!
- War!
- War!
War!
I tell you once more in the last hour of my life if the good of the Order is the concern of yours, be patient
Do not make war now
Poland, Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia will overthrow us
Give them back the ships...
What does that mean?
Sanderus
What are you doing here?
Be quiet, Gracious Lord.
The brethren should not learn we know each other
I've been to Szczytno.
Your damsel is there
How do you know?
From the chaplain, who is an honest man
She is watched now by Commander Zygfryd de Love
He did her no harm, for once.
When he wanted to do her wrong something pushed him down the staircase, he fainted and almost died
And now he is afraid of her
Do you hear, my Lord, the Grand Master died
What did you say?
The Grand Master died?
Yes, sir.
People say that now they will elect Ulrich the late Master's brother, God grant him everlasting rest
Thus, war is inevitable
I wish you, my Lord, that you may rule with justice, reason and in peace
We are here not for peace's sake but to fight for the faith against pagans and heathens
You have none to fight with, Gracious Lord for you are surrounded by Christian peoples only
True Christians do not support the faithless
What answer have we to take back to our king?
Will the ships with grain be given back to us?
Ships with weapons will become our legal booty
May I remind you, Gracious Lord about the promise made by your late brother and ask you for the safe-conduct letter to Szczytno?
The crew of Szczytno, with de Love set out to fight the rebellious Samogitia
You will find nobody there.
Wait until quieter times
Are you leaving, sir?
Perhaps it is better this way, for I can smell war here
That's true.
Zygfryd de Love and his crew set out for Samogitia
- I will search for him there
- You, for him, and I, for your damsel
He certainly hid her somewhere, to leave no trace
Give me, sir, one purse more and I will proceed from castle to castle and although this is dangerous, maybe I will learn something
Take it and go
It is time for us to bid farewell, sir
I wish you success in your noble search
If you have no objections, sir I would like to announce that Jagienka of Zgorzelice is the fairest and most virtuous lady in the world
Announce it wherever you wish, my Lord.
Perhaps it is even true
Jagienka
Back from Cracow already?
Have you heard something about Zbyszko?
I feel so restless.
The king's deputies came back without him from Malbork
- We were among the Teutonic Knights
- To look for something he'll never find
I have hardly begun to administer here and now I have to go
Among these scoundrels, the fate of Jurand or Danusia may befall him
- Take me with you.
I will help you
- You will help me indeed
You think when you cast off your skirt you will grow wiser
Wisdom is in the head.
Do you want Cztan or Wolf to take me?
They will not take you.
I made them both swear it Cztan, that he will defend you against Wolf and Wolf, that he will not give you to Cztan
Lord Jesus did not spare your cunningness
Everything will always be as you wish
If it were so, you would have long since been mistress of Bogdaniec
Why do you kiss me?
I am only saying goodnight.
We must start at dawn tomorrow
- Are you not afraid to go there?
- I am not.
I want to be near Zbyszko
If Danusia is lost, Zbyszko will be so grieved that he will not look at you
I do not want him to look at me.
I only want to be near him
Look at this giant
- That is no knight for he is going on foot
- He must be blind
He does not even have a dog.
We cannot leave him without help
Do you understand Christian language, old man?
- Get up
- What is the matter with you?
Can you speak?
He is trying to show that they have torn his tongue out
Who did that to you?
The Knights of the Teutonic Order
Are you from here?
From Mazovia?
What were you doing among the Teutonic Knights?
Do you come from Szczytno?
Were you not seeking your child there?
Then, you are Jurand of Spychow
The lord?
Teutonic Knights?
Let's go against the dog's brothers!
Will you fight against the peasants?
They are not the guilty ones
The Knights sit in their fortalices now
We will catch the Germans and throw them at our lord's feet
I am the uncle of Zbyszko of Bogdaniec and until he returns I give the orders here
- The lord went away two days ago
- Where to?
To the Samogitian frontier to search for the young lady
- The war is raging there.
- Then we missed one another
Hlawa?
Where is the lord?
- He keeps on discussing...
- Good...
Uncle.
What are you doing here?
I have been looking for you all over the world and at last I've found you
You thought I will sit in Bogdaniec till the end of my days
Jurand is in Spychow
The Teutonic Knights blinded him, tore out his tongue and cut off his right hand
Dreadful
And you?
Did you accomplish anything?
Have you found Danusia?
- No
- No?
This is my uncle, a knight from Bogdaniec
He has no equal on the battlefield
- Welcome, sir, be seated...
- Welcome
We want to attack the Germans
Two days ago we were near the castle at Nowe Kowno and they defeated us
- Defeated?
- Defeated...
We consider if it would be better to wait near Nowe Kowno, or go to Regneta
- Where is Nowe Kowno?
- About two miles from here
- And Regneta?
- Far northwards
It is good that it is far.
The Germans are not expecting us there
He is right
Exactly.
In the vicinity of Nowe Kowno they already defeated us
Because of that, they do not expect any attack
But Regneta is certainly less well-guarded
- He is right
- Where shall we make the ambush?
Here, near Nowe Kowno
You shall take position in the thickets above the highway and wait for the reinforcements on their way to the castle
200 people will not take part in the battle.
They will retreat
- I will attack from behind
- Cunning
The Teutonic Knights march and hide in a column
You can't destroy the columns with your bellies, can you?
You are wrong, uncle
It is the most courageous nation in the world
They are joyful, the accursed dogs
- At them!
- Attack!
Bind him.
Bind him
It's an important knight...
De Lorche
I recognised you
By the holy bones of St. Laurence.
I implore you, where is de Love?
- He escaped
- Is Jurand's daughter with him?
Jurand's daughter?
There is only an idiot-girl they had shown Jurand in Szczytno
How do you know it is an idiot-girl?
I heard her only, for she is ill and does not leave her wicker litter
Zygfryd had nothing to do with the kidnapping
- Right, yes!
- He is a faithful servant of the Order
And he was not aware of Rotgier and Godfryd's crimes
- Where have they escaped to?
- I do not know
It was agreed, in case we were attacked by somebody Zygfryd and his men will withdraw into a safe place till the battle ends
- Hear this?
- My Lord!
My Lord and defender, save me
But for you, the wolves would have devoured me or I would have fallen into the hands of those sons of Satan
My Lord, tell them to give me something to drink else you will be burdened with my innocent soul
Here, you drunkard
- Christ, our Lord, that is but mare's milk
- Then don't drink it
Thank you for taking me under your protection
You never refuse me any money or drink better than this mare's milk, which disgusts me but of which I will drink some more just to show that a pious pilgrim drinks from no mortification
Stop fooling around and tell me, do you know about Danusia?
Just a moment...
I have come to love you, Lord
When misfortune came upon you, I told myself I have to help you
Suffice to say that I found her and from that moment I have stuck to commander Zygfryd de Love as a bur sticks to a dog's tail...
- Is Danusia still alive?
- She is
He carries her in a wicker litter, fastened between two horses
That's the idiot-girl.
I told you de Love became odd after his son's death
What idiot-girl?
You told yourself, my Lord that your damsel has a lute
- Where are they?
- Certainly somewhere in the vicinity
De Love led the reinforcements which were marching towards Nowe Kowno
When he saw he fell into an ambush, he ordered a withdrawal
- Where could they find shelter?
- I do not know...
Perhaps by the potter deep in the woods, where we recently stopped
- To horses!
- Wait!
Wait!
Give me a horse I will ride ahead and will tell them I escaped from captivity
It will be safer this way.
I might be of some use to your damsel when you will attack Zygfryd de Love's men
Sir, don't believe that drunkard
Give him a horse.
He didn't betray me before, he will not betray me now
Sanderus
He purposely took their swords and cuirasses
- You take Zygfryd, he must be in the hut
- Good
- And I'll take that knight
- Yes
Hlawa...
You watch Danusia
- Forward
- Help
Bind him!
Bind him!
- What is the matter with you?
- Help me to my feet
Hold this
Danusia.
Danusia
- I am afraid
- Danusia.
It is me, Zbyszko
- I am afraid
- Danusia
It is me, Zbyszko.
Danusia
Danusia.
Danusia.
Danusia...
Let go of me.
I'll kill him like a dog
Scoundrel.
Would you stab a bound captive?
Danusia.
Do you recognise me?
Danusia
I am frightened
Listen, bitch, you'll dress the lady in clean garments and you will dress yourself in the rags which you have made her wear hitherto
Then we will choose a branch for you
- Danusia!
Defend me, help me!
- Get out!
Leave her alone!
They brought her to this state by torment
There you have the nobility of your Zygfryd
Let Jagienka know Danusia is ill and we have to ride slowly.
Go on
True, my Lord, your life in Poland is more difficult and complicated than I imagined living in Lorraine
Oh, yes.
You'll have to make the choice, my Lord
We can give you a guide to Cracow if you want to stay with us if not, the way to Malbork stays open
Farewell, my Lord, God willing, I will see you sometime again
Hey!
Take him
I was asked, Gracious Lord, to bring you Zygfryd de Love
Before you, my Lord, stands that hellhound, that Teutonic werewolf who tortured you and destroyed your child
Let me know what I am to do with him and how I am to punish him
To your knees, dog
What are you doing, sir?
You will not let this Beelzebub go, sir?
Do you want to give the captive his freedom?
Do you want him to go without vengeance and punishment?
For this purpose we chased him all over the world
He belongs to him.
He can do with him whatever he wants
Lord, if your will is to be fulfilled the captive must be conducted to the border
Here is our border and it is not far to yours
If the divine thunderbolt does not choke and blast you there is no danger to you from men
Go free
Stop!
- The flowers smell sweet
- Danusia
- Where am I?
- Near Spychow
Danusia, wait.
Oh merciful Jesus, wait, wait!
Danusia!
I sought her until I found her and rescued her but she preferred to go to God rather than to Spychow
War!
War!
The dawn is not far off
The battle is about to begin
Repeat once more my orders!
You, Grand Duke!
The Lithuanian forces are on the right wing near Stebark
You, brother Ligngwan
The Smolensk companies are to be situated near the Polish wing the Mscislaw one in the middle of the Lithuanian forces and the Nowogrod regiment stays with me
And your men, Khan Dzelal-Eddin?
My men will go together with the Lithuanians
What about you, Jan of Lamberk?
The Czech companies will proceed with the Smolensk ones the rest of them together with Poles
And you, Lord Marshall?
According to your orders, Gracious King 60 men form your guard
The Cracow company will go in the middle of the left wing near Lodwigowe followed by companies from Sieradz and Poznan
I ordered to dig loop holes in front of our lines and to conceal them thoroughly
When the Polish heavy cavalry falls into these holes then our archers and our cannons will easily hit them for the bodies will make an excellent mark
Further, the knights' cavalry will attack from both sides
And what if the Poles will not advance first?
Jagiello is a reasonable leader
Jagiello and Witold are cunning and shrewd
But they are totally lacking the European knightly arts and customs
Their people lack the soldiers discipline they get excited easily, they will certainly first attack us
No.
The heavy armed knights will enter the battle at last
As first the Tartars and the light Lithuanian cavalry will proceed
The Lithuanians and Tartars, with their skins and wooden shields will not resist the pressure of the Teutonic Knight clad in steel armour
But the Lithuanians and Tartars will make a reconnaissance to check if no ambush was prepared.
I know this is dangerous
We conquered in all battles using our stratagem
We shall crush them at once with our heavy horses and equipment
We shall take every precaution
First the loop holes, then cannons and archers and at the end, I shall lead 16 squadrons myself
I shall fight together with you
As it is fitting for a true knight
The leader should not go into the fighting crowd because he will not be able to command
According to eastern customs, the leader commands on a hill in order to see the whole battlefield
Right you are, Grand Duke
True, in the East they use to fight like this
The sun is already up...
It's time to take our positions.
Lead out the men-at-arms
No.
They will wait in the woods.
Do not hurry
It will be easier to form the rank and bear the heavy armour in the shadow
You want us to hide in the bushes
We want to fight openly, as it befits true knights
- I will not stop my warriors
- You will wait!
Even you will not stop them, Gracious Lord.
What do you bid us to do?
You will obey my orders.
Wait!
Let Father Bartosz prepare for Mass.
Two Masses
And you will wait in the woods!
Let us greet the sun
How many of the pagans are hiding in the woods?
I suppose about one hundred thousand
Thus, it will be the biggest battle of our times
We do not know how big their forces are
But they had never before brought together such power
Perhaps about one hundred thousand
What is the name of the village in front of the camp of the Teutonic Knights?
Grunwald...
Before these barbarians form ranks, we will occupy the best positions
And there look there, brethren, the guests of the Order occupy their positions
The flower of the European knighthood
The rest is in God's hands
He will support His faithful servants
The rest is in God's hands.
He will support His faithful servants
Gracious Lord, the Germans are marching
To arms, brethren!
The task will be bloody but we will secure the rule of Christianity in the East for a millennium
The Grand Master of the Order
My Lords, let us go to Mass
Gracious Lord.
With the Knights of the Teutonic Order
The knights from Bavaria, Swabia and France
Cancel the Mass.
Give me a horse
My king, the knights from Rhineland, from Frisian England
They hide in the woods
They are better at handling spoons than swords...
You do not know them.
The Poles do not lack courage but their king is hoping to receive the offer of peace at the last minute
Shame.
The whole power of the Order is afraid of the Poles
I prefer death and so I will be quite alone
I will charge the Polish army with these swords
This is contrary to discipline
Advise me how to draw the enemy out of the woods
King.
The heralds of the Teutonic Order are riding towards our camp
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold, to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
Grand Master Ulrich bids us also to inform you that if the field of battle seems too small for you he will withdraw his armies somewhat so that you need not loiter in the thickets
We have enough swords, but we will take these as an omen of victory
Couriers...
Withdraw the heavy squadrons, they are not the first to enter.
Stop!
Stop!
It is the king's order, turn back
Stop!
You do not enter first.
Stop!
Turn back!
It is the king's order.
Turn back, turn back!
Couriers to Duke Witold, to Dzebal Eddin
Lithuania!
Lucifer swallow them, they managed to get out
It's Witold's light cavalry...
Wallendrod!
Now begin, in God's name
We will trample our archers!
Begin
- Our knights will trample us down!
- They will trample us down!
King.
Come to the rescue.
Save our army
Lichtenstein...
Attack!
Attack!
The Kalisz and Sieradz companies, proceed to support the right wing
Proceed immediately to support Mazovia
The company is in peril
Powala, three companies proceed around through Ludwikowo and attack
Turn back and follow me
We will make a circuit and charge in a flank
Zyndram, let the infantry attack
- At them!
Attack!
- At the enemy!
- Forward!
- At them!
Kuno Lichtenstein, do you recognise me?
Yes, I do
I vowed that I would find you and meet you
Stand!
- To the death, with no quarter
- Stand!
Take off the helmet
Stand your ground, you dog!
That is he, who this very morning thought himself superior to all the powers of the earth
Jagna?
Jagna!
Jagna
THE END
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage, which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER
- Whom are you carrying with you?
- Who are you?
Out of the way!
Lower your lance, knave
- This is Count Jurand of Spychow
- Save us, oh Lord
We are merchants from Plock.
We carried grain from the mill
They broke the Order's laws
Traffic is allowed here only upon the consent of Commander Zygfryd de Lowe
I am the master here.
Let them go
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pious Commander.
We detained the Polish carts loaded with grain
But we were attacked later on
- By whom?
- By Jurand of Spychow
Father, give us your permission
Danusia.
Danusia
Danusia!
Close the gates.
The gates
It's raining.
It's raining
Thank you, oh Lord, for saving us
Open the gates
Teutonic Knights
- Are you Jurand's woman?
- I am master of Spychow's wife
Mother.
O, my mother
Mother!
I will take vengeance over you, my wife.
I will
- You there, innkeeper
- Yes, sir?
Clear the tables and bring in the candles Duchess Anna Danuta is stopping here for a rest
Magda, Magda, clear the tables.
Out with you, beggars.
Go away!
This company is too distinguished for us
Let us go
Be seated, young boar
It is not too distinguished for us.
We are gentle-folk
Hey, Danusia rejoice our hearts with the same song you sang at Zator
- Who is that?
- A maiden from the duchess' court
I thought she was an angel.
What do they call her?
Danusia.
Her father is Jurand of Spychow.
She is an orphan
Why, Jurand is still alive
The Knights of the Teutonic Order killed her mother
Jurand was out hunting when they came to Spychow
A German with a peacock feather on his helmet tied her to his saddle
She turned pale and died on the rope
There is Danusia's knight
Thank you
Worshipful lady, I wish to make my vow to that maiden
Do you wish her to be your lady?
But who are you?
That is my nephew, worshipful lady, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
- And you, sir?
- I am Macko of Bogdaniec
We were in Lithuania, fighting under the command of your brother, Duke Witold
- Were you wounded?
- No.
But we took splendid booty
Are you not boasting by any chance?
Let us see that booty
Fighting the knights from the Frisian country we made an agreement
Whoever wins should take the wagons and cuirass of the defeated there were few suits of armour and costly garments for my nephew
Do you want him to be your knight, Danusia?
I do
I vow to tear some peacocks crests from the German helmets like those of the knight who killed your mother had, and lay them at your feet
- Foolish you are, young boar
- I have vowed
The only way to get booty is to fight under Duke Witold against the Tartars
I have to get German crests.
Where shall I find them among the Tartars?
You will find captives there
Who will cultivate the land in Bogdaniec?
- I have vowed
- Because you are stupid
Duchess Ryngalla poisoned the duke and she was absolved
- We have enough money
- I have vowed
Where will you find the German crests?
Where?
Lower your lance...
Madman.
It is Grand Master's envoy to our majesty the king
- Who are you?
- I am Powala of Taczewo, you fool
You insulted our king.
You'll pay for that with your head
I welcome thee, dear Duke and Duchess of Mazovia
I welcome thee, dear brother Lingwen, Duke of Mscislaw and Nowogrod
I welcome thee, noble envoys of the Grand Master
I welcome thee gracious fathers and all the guests at our court in Cracow the Ruthenian boyars and the Polish Knights
Try to win the king's heart.
It is up to him to pardon you or cut your head off
That wild Lithuanian drinks only mare's milk
- Don't you drink, Gracious Lord?
- No.
Springwater only
Thus, you give a good example, Gracious Lord
A still better one is given by those who act nobly
That is you, Gracious Lord
His most worshipful Majesty, the Grand Master of the Blessed Virgin order aimed to let Your Majesty know gracious King, with all due respect and esteem that not only the Lithuanians but also many Poles help the rebelling pagans in Samogitia
Our people and the people from Ruthenia...
We have privileges from the Holy Father
His Holiness Urban IV gave his consent to the Order of the Blessed Virgin to sell agricultural products, but not for profit
We vowed poverty as monks but our Order is compelled to fight with pagans
The Order builds castles, mills
Who can say there is no order and fear of God in the lands belonging to us?
Order and fear of God?
And on the border, steady confusion and fires
But in our land we hold Christian laws in esteem.
We do not insult the envoys
Whom are you referring to, noble knight?
Has somebody insulted you in Poland?
I did, Gracious Lord
If the Teutonic Knight demands punishment, let there be punishment
But Zbyszko is the last in our line.
If he is no more, we shall be no more
Allow me, sir, to give my head for his
Law crushes the guilty, but it is not a dragon which laps the blood of a man without looking whose it is
What about the Teutonic Knights' justice?
Samogitia.
Swords, robbery
- They have privileges granted
- Let's fight them!
It is the booty you are after
We will not expose Poland to a conflict with the Order of the Blessed Virgin
Thus you will cut off my nephews' head?
We will.
We shall act according to the law
Ask Lichtenstein for mercy.
Only he can withdraw his complaint
That is true.
I was wearing my suit of armour
Thus, you could have defended yourself, sir
It is a suit of armour one wears only when paying solemn visits
Piercing this metal plate with a blade would surely deprive one of his life
Was it your intention to kill Squire von Lichtenstein?
It was.
As long as he was alive I could not get the crest
But I called to him from a distance to lower his lance
If he had called that he was an envoy, I would have left him in peace
True.
Why did he not call out?
Can you swear on the Passion of our Lord that you did not see his cloak and the cross?
I cannot.
I should certainly not have attacked our knight
I knew it was a Knight of the Teutonic Order
How could there be any other Teutonic Knight in the vicinity of Cracow, except for an envoy or one of his colour?
Commander von Lichtenstein
- Pardon him
- I do pardon him
From the bottom of my heart, as a servant of Christ and a monk
- Praise be to him
- But I am here as an envoy
So he who has wronged an envoy, has insulted the Order and insulted Christ Himself
And such a wrongdoing I cannot forgive
Kneel down
God... be merciful to me
The noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec is condemned by the Castellan's sentence to be beheaded with the sword
- Danusia
- Don't be mournful.
The Castellan agreed to postpone the execution
- What good will it do?
- Isn't it hard for you?
One week sooner, one later...
- What is the weather like outside?
- The sun is shining
Almighty God!
If I could mount a horse and ride through the vast fields!
It is hard for you...
Sing me a song
If I could be saved, my maiden...
We have to go, my lady
The duchess wrote a letter to the Grand Master
The king will pardon you if the Grand Master intercedes in your favour
Macko went to Malbork with the letter.
May he only arrive in time
Stop.
It is not a Saracen.
Are you a Christian?
I am.
Honestly like a knight and you are like a robber
I am Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine and I joined the Order to fight the Saracens
I thought there are no fools in Lorraine.
Saracens here?
You stupid man.
We have been Christians for ages
What about the Mazurians?
Don't make a fool out of me
I have been shown wooden Mazurian idols in Malbork
Let me give him the last blow.
He is a Mazurian
To arms!
Jurand!
Kill them
Help me.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, please help me
- Spare him.
He's not a Teutonic Knight
- He fought against us
Who are you?
Macko of Bogdaniec.
Whom have I to thank for the rescue?
I am Jurand of Spychow
Jesus...
- Who are you?
- De Bergow.
You must know about me
The pious Commander of Szczytno will offer a ransom for me
- We are in Spychow
- You are Jurand
I don't take ransoms
No Teutonic Knight will leave this place on his own feet
Bind him in chains and put him in the dungeon
- And what about him, sir?
- I am Count de Lorche
He is not a Teutonic Knight.
He is a knight from Lorraine
They came here to fight Saracens.
You offered him to me, sir
What will you do with him?
My nephew's life is in the hands of the Grand Master
I was on my way to Malbork with a letter from the Duchess of Mazovia and he wounded me
Let him pay for it now
A splinter is sticking between your ribs.
There's not much time left for you
I cannot help it...
I must go to Cracow
Now I shall not escape death.
They'll cut off my head
Most certainly.
But don't be mournful
I will have such an oak coffin made for you that even the lords of the crown have no better
I won't even allow them to behead you on the same cloth they use for the townsfolk
I have already agreed with the merchant Amyley to give you a quite new one, scarlet good enough for the king to use to line his fur coat with
And I won't grudge you masses.
Never fear
God reward you, uncle
- Uncle?
- Yes, Zbyszko?
- I want you to make me a promise
- A promise?
When they cut my head off, take a mighty woman for yourself
What?
Are you mad?
You said it yourself.
Our line must not die out
- Look.
Do you see?
- Do you spit blood like that all the time?
A splinter two inches long is sticking between my ribs
I am going to die before winter comes
- Only you yourself can save your life
- What?
Have you heard about Duke Witold?
How he was imprisoned in Krewa and escaped disguised in women's clothes?
Now, take my leather jacket, take my hood and go, understand?
Here you have the ransom the Teutons paid for this de Lorche from Lorraine...
Then they'll cut off your head instead of mine
Good for them.
I'll die anyway in two or three weeks' time
- Take it
- I won't do that
I wish you had never been born
Listen it was not a shame for Duke Witold to escape in that way it will not be a shame for you
Duke Witold is a grand duke
He has received a crown from the king's hands, he has wealth and lordship
And I, poor nobleman, have nothing but my honour
Don't you understand that I love you and won't give your head for mine?
May the cross-wolves perish if children are to be executed through them
Shame, shame...
Stop!
Stop!
He doesn't belong to the headman.
He's mine, he's mine
She threw her veil over him.
It's an old custom.
He is hers
Let's go to the castle.
To the Castellan
Pagan country, pagan customs
It is true.
Such ancient customs exist
But it is more suited to the robbers of the Carpathian foothills and to the simple folk
Ask Father Stanislaw, he knows everything about laws and customs
One should have asked the Grand Master
It was his envoy who was insulted
The ancient, folk customs became law
Gracious Duchess.
The betrothal must take place at once if I am to honour this custom
Gracious Duke, we offer these humble gifts to you, the truly Christian lord and our Order's friend
Don't bear a grudge because of the petty conflicts and quarrels and the inconsiderate and passionate deeds committed by youngsters
You may assure the Grand Master we are his true friends and defenders of our common faith
The pious Grand Commander Zygfryd de Lowe of Szczytno wants to lodge a complaint to be considered by your Serene Highness not because of "youngsters"
Jurand of Spychow, your Serene Highness, attacked our people
He slaughtered and wounded many.
He took brother de Bergow captive
We have here the noble witness, Lord Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine who is the Order's guest
He has also been cruelly injured by Jurand...
Who is this most beautiful maiden in the world?
Fascinating indeed
She is the daughter of Jurand, the man who aimed to kill you
Hot paternal blood
Against a girl like that I'll fight most gladly
Border disputes... the pious knight de Love accuses the Count of Spychow while the noble Jurand accuses the Grand Commander of Szczytno
It is not only this complaint we ask you to consider, your Serene Highness
The Grand Master would like to get acquainted with your opinion concerning the alliance of King Jagiello with the heathens
And with the schismatics from Ruthenia as well
The Grand Master sends you this holy relic the same the gracious Duchess asked for the forefinger of St. Onufry who died a glorious death, killed by the pagans
I told you to go with this mission to Cracow and to negotiate there
- The Duke of Mazovia is benevolent
- But he will not give us Jurand
- Jurand will beg at our gates, my father
- What have you said, my son?
I said, my father, Jurand will come to us on his knees to get his daughter back
- I do not understand
- Do you want to kidnap his daughter?
She is the daughter of the most rancorous enemy of the Order
You barely escaped him with your own life
It does not agree with the knightly gospel and honour
We are destined to live on the borders, in forests
Doomed is the one who is not able to repay a blow with a blow
Listen.
She is still a child.
Don't force me to warn them
- You will not do it, sir
- I will, so help me God...
You won't...
Give him the last blow...
It is not necessary after I worked upon him
Proceed, sir, I will join you
Forgive him, Lord Jesus, his sins and grant him everlasting rest
Why, oh Lord, to spread Thy rule to defend Thy home, we have to make so much injustice
You will certainly not bring me alive to Bogda...
- Water...
- Stampeding horses!
To the woods!
To the woods!
You intruded unnecessarily, I would have managed
- Hlawa.
Take the horse
- Zych
Zych...
At last...
Good gracious
Thus, you returned to your Bogdaniec
- I did, didn't I, just to die here
- What is wrong?
Jagna, it's our neighbour Macko of Bogdaniec
Come here
- Who is that?
- Did you not recognise Zbyszko?
Zbyszko?
Jagna, come here
Quickly.
Give him a kiss, for old times' sake
Am I already at death's door, Father?
I tried to pull out the splinter, but I failed
- He failed.
Zych?
- Yes, brother?
Do you have much land of your own?
Thanks to good husbandry three malets and about 50 men
And Jagna?
Jagna, how old is she?
She is now so attracted to boys that when she sees them she rubs one knee against the other
Zych, you lied, you have 70 men
- What is that to you?
- If Zbyszko takes your Jagna...
Well, well.
Let me hear your confession, it may be too late later
Tell me the truth, as in the face of God.
How many men have you?
- Will he live, sir?
- God willing
But the priest advised to try to heal him with bear's fat
Hlawa.
Have you brought bear's fat?
- No, my lady.
The dogs ate it all up
- I will look for some in the tree-hives
I've been told I could easily find one there
It's dangerous.
Take our Hlawa with you
To frighten the bear away?
No
God have mercy...
Use your axe
- Who are you?
- Jagienka
I don't know what would have happened if it was not for you
Leave me alone.
Will you?
A lad of ours also went with a fork and an axe and the bear tore him to pieces
Thus, I went after you
- Then it was you there under the pines?
- Yes
There cannot be another girl like you in the world
- You ought to go to the war
- Don't laugh at me
Wait.
We'd better get a beaver at once because when the wound opens you have to stop it with beaver's fat and the sickness will leave him
- Where are the beaver's lodges?
- Come
Did you heard me sing, when you laid in wait for the bear?
- It was you?
- Yes
These woods belong to Cztan of Rogow
- The man who would like to marry you?
- If only I would let him!
I've been told that Cztan grinds his teeth at Wolf your other neighbour who would like to marry you too
Oh, yes
- Foolish lads
- Why?
When your father was away one of them should have taken you from Zgorzelice
What if your father had come back and found you with a child?
Let them try.
You think I don't know how to grasp a spear or a crossbow?
I would have driven each of them home again and raided their villages
If I were Cztan or Wolf, I would not be afraid of your father or you
- But I would have taken you
- You would have?
Why should a girl fight with lads when she ought to marry
Don't be stupid.
Be quiet
There are the beavers, in the warm spring
- I've got it, I've got it
- I am going for it
Don't.
The mud is deep.
Anyone unfamiliar with it will certainly drown
- Then how will you get it?
- Don't worry about it.
Let's go
I've left my arrows in the willow.
Wait
- Hey, what a cunning girl you are
- Oh, go away
Squeeze out the water from my plait
- And I was waiting for you like a fool
- Was I to undress in front of you?
- That would be something to marvel at
- Be quiet.
Take the beaver
Give it
- Zbyszko
- Yes?
I will marry neither Cztan nor Wolf
God will give you the best man possible.
You will be worthy of him
In a couple of weeks, Macko will be able to mount a horse
I am waiting for that as for salvation.
It is hard for me to stay here
- Why?
- Were you told about Danusia?
I heard something.
I know she covered you with a veil
I know every knight vows some deed, even the married ones
- But this Danusia, who is she?
- I will tell you, as I would my own sister
For her sake I would cross the ninth river and the ninth sea
I will fulfil what I have vowed to her, unless I die first
- Is it true?
- It is
I did not realise that.
Hlawa...
May God reward you for everything, my girl
Hlawa will help you to get the beavers.
I am going back home
What the deuce!
Who has killed him?
Wait...
He is still breathing.
- It's not worth it.
He'll die in no time
- Let's help him
Leave him.
If he recovers, it will bring us trouble
And so his purse and sword...
He'll reward us happily with the purse when he recovers, and besides we gain merit in heaven for rescuing a Christian.
Let's take him
You fool.
It's a mere loss of time
Go on.
Take him
Perhaps he'll survive
An urgent message for the gracious Duchess from the Count of Spychow
Perhaps he announces he'll come for Christmas
Nothing but bad news.
A part of the fortalice had been burned in Spychow
Jesus
Father Kaleb writes, the Count of Spychow may recover but the sparks and coals so burned his only eye that little light was left in it and he is threatened with blindness
That is why the Count of Spychow...
summons Danusia to come to him for he wants to see her again before darkness overwhelms him
He also humbly thanks the Duchess for raising the girl like a daughter and he promises that he would come to Ciechanow for Christmas to fall at the lady's feet and beg her favour and support for Danusia for the future
Come nearer
I do not know you.
Why hasn't Tolima come?
He was injured in a recent fight with the Germans
The Count begs for the swift return of his daughter since he may be blind soon
Gracious lady, we have to go back as soon as the horses have rested
We shall meet your neighbours, Cztan and Wolf, at Krzesnia
- Show them to me from a distance
- I will, Zbyszko
They will meet you in front of the church.
What will they do?
Attend me as best they know
They will not attend to you today, understand?
That's them
- What now?
- Well, what?
- Shall we at once...
- How can you fall on him in church?
Not in church but after Mass
That's her father.
Do you remember what he said?
If we started a fight he would banish us from Zgorzelice
If it were not for that, I would have broken your ribs long ago
Or I yours
Let's better break his together
- Let's do it
- After Mass
Hurry up
- Woe is me
- To the inn
I have to pay for the mass for my uncle's health.
I'll go back
- We'll send money from Zgorzelice
- I have to go back
Go.
God be with you
If either of you two denies that the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the world is Danusia Jurand of Spychow's daughter I will challenge him to fight on horseback or on foot, until death
What?
You dog's brother.
Jagienka is not the most beautiful
He is mocking
That's what you knights are like?
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
Where is Zbyszko?
He went back to the church.
He forgot to pay for the Mass
Daddy.
Perhaps we will send a couple of lads to Krzesnia?
- What for?
- The quarrel has broken out there
What quarrel?
Whom is he to fight with?
Cztan and Wolf, he'll fight for me
If so, let them fight
- You've done it quickly, how was it?
- I just paid for the Mass
- Haven't you been in the inn?
- I have
- Well, and what happened?
- Nothing
Now my uncle feels better, I shall go to Mazovia
- To Danusia?
- I have vowed
You vowed to get a peacock's crest
I vowed to take her for my wife.
God grant you health and all the best
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
- I am your servant, my Lord
- My servant?
Lady Jagienka of Zgorzelice gave me to you
- Go back home.
I don't want you
- I will not go back, sir
I am a prisoner of war from Boleslawice.
I was given to you
- Thus, you are mine?
- Yours, my Lord
Then, I order you to go back
Lady Jagienka sent you this too
Go away.
Do you want me to break your bones?
- What is your name?
- In Czech, Hlawa.
In Polish, Big Head
Give me the cape
Christians, save a servant of God
Whoever you are, sir, help a servant of God
Who are you?
Sanderus.
My horse ran away, I was left alone without weapons
A wild beast may appear any moment in the forest
I shall perish if you do not save me
Give him a horse
May God multiply your victories, valiant knight
Hey, innkeeper.
We want to wait until the snowstorm is over
Welcome travellers from far away
Get out of here
I am dead-cold.
Order a flask of wine for me
For two or three gulps, I shall excuse you a month in purgatory
He looks like a drunkard
Beware of everlasting damnation.
You are speaking to a man who ate hard-boiled eggs with the Holy Father last Easter
How can you write me off a month of purgatory if you are not ordained?
I have obtained permission to sell pardons and relics
- Where are you from?
- Under the Prussian lords, from Malbork
You speak our language well What do they call you?
I am a German and my name is Sanderus
I was born at Torun, where all folk speak like that
Even the brothers of the Order understand your language
Innkeeper.
Bring warm beer
- Is it long since you left Malbork?
- Long enough
I have been in the Holy Land then I returned to Malbork and now I carry the holy relics and pardons which pious Christians buy for their soul's salvation
Where have you got those holy wares from?
I have plenary pardons, pardons for 500 years, for 300 and cheaper ones, so that even poor people can buy them and thus shorten the pains of purgatory for themselves...
I have pardons for past sins and for the future ones but I don't keep the money I get for them
A piece of black bread and a drink of water is enough for me
The remainder of what I get I take to Rome to help them to collect in time for a new crusade
And these relics?
Are they important ones?
Such that it is not fitting even to talk of them without taking your hat off
I have a shoe of the ass ridden on by the Holy Family on their flight into Egypt
I have a feather from archangel Gabriel's wing which he lost during the Annunciation
I have some of the oil in which the pagans boiled St. John
I have a rung of the ladder Jacob saw in his dreams and a phial containing wind, which was blowing in the Bethlehem stable
Is the storm over?
Why, no, I suppose we will have to spend Christmas Eve here
Saddle the horses.
Let's go
It's very dangerous now, my Lord, the roads are buried in snow
I have to reach the Duke of Mazovia before Christmas Eve
They will wait, my Lord, and here we may lose our way and perish
You can stay here, you drunkard
I can't.
Who will defend my holy goods?
Don't go, my Lord
- We rode off the highway
- I warned you
- Let's go
- The horses will not go on
Everything is going wrong, my Lord.
One can't see the highway any more
There is a man under the snow
It will snow us over too, my Lord
It will snow us over too, it will snow us over
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
It will snow us over!
Some men...
light...
There are some men there
- Hey!
- You there!
Hey!
Hey!
Is anybody there?
Who are you?
The Duke of Mazovia's men.
We have been sent to help travellers
Follow me, there are some people buried there
It is Jurand
Give me a torch
Rub him with snow
Gracious Lord.
Jurand of Spychow has been found under the snow
You found him?
Bring him here
Danusia?
We tried to find her.
Have you left her back at Spychow?
I was going to her, to Ciechanow...
Why, you have sent men with a letter for her.
Wake up!
By God's mercy, where is my child?
Listen.
There came an armed troop with a letter from you saying that you were injured during a fire
Woe to me.
They have seized my child and they will destroy her
Who?
The Teutonic Knights... de Lowe Godfryd...
Rotgier...
- Was it you who dug me out?
- With the others
- Are you going to help me now?
- Your daughter saved me from death
- Do you love her?
- I belong to her forever...
Even if I have to bite Prussian castles with my teeth, I'll get her
Do you know what the vengeance of the brothers of the Order is?
And now to Spychow
My Lord.
Some monks are waiting for you here
They were bustling about Spychow.
They want to speak with you
- Who are you?
- Pilgrims
- Where from?
- From Szczytno
Where is my child?
He who sent us ordered us not to speak with you in the presence of witnesses
I have no secrets before these men
But we have.
If you bid them to stay we will have to depart
Since it has to be so, you remain alone
Your daughter was kidnapped by robbers
With crosses on their cloaks?
No.
But God blessed the brethren, they rescued her and now she is with them
Where?
Under the protection of the pious brother Szomberg
Szomberg.
The one who strangled Witold's children
He takes good care of her and she will not be harmed
What have I to do to get her back?
- Humble yourself before the Order
- Silence!
- Have you a letter?
- No
We say what we have to say
Nothing evil will happen to your daughter.
The brethren will repay you good for evil if you satisfy their just demands
- What do they want?
- Brother de Bergow released
I will release him
And all the other prisoners you still have at Spychow
I will not bargain for my child
But that is not all
To protect the good name of the Order, the brethren add another condition
You will declare to the Duke and to the whole knighthood that it was robbers who kidnapped your daughter and that you had to pay a ransom to get her back
It is true that robbers kidnapped my child and that I must pay a ransom to them to get her back
You will say that you took a ransom from de Bergow to pay the robbers
I have never taken a ransom
For it was never a question of your child
Or do something else
You may come to Szczytno yourself for your daughter
I?
To Szczytno?
For robbers may again kidnap her on the way and the suspicion will fall on the pious brethren
Who will guarantee my return from Szczytno?
The virtue of the brethren, their justice and piety
I will come to Szczytno.
But both of you will stay here until my return and then you will go with Bergow and the prisoners
You don't want to trust the monks so why should they trust you?
Whoever you are, do not test my patience
Say what you were ordered to say
The brethren told us you have to go to Szczytno without saying a word
Did they not tell you I would break you with a wheel in Spychow?
Your daughter is in the hands of the brethren
What did they want?
Tell us
Are you sick, my Lord?
What news of Danusia?
With what proposal have they come?
With a ransom.
For de Bergow
Where is Danusia?
She is not with the Teutonic Knights
Come closer
He is destined for my daughter and thus he is to be lord here after my death
You will serve him faithfully in peace and in war
Have you heard?
Dear God.
Why are you giving me Spychow already?
I am giving you Danusia
The hour of death is unknown
Where is the master?
- What are your grace's commands?
- I ask you where the master is?
- He is gone
- Where to?
I do not know.
He went heavily armed
The highway will be on the right, beyond the woods and from the knoll you'll see the castle at once
From the knoll, you say?
The castle?
You are not a German, sir, are you?
They did not pay their taxes
The brethren need a lot of money for the war with Samogitis
After the war against the Samogitians is over, they will start another one
Fishing is forbidden hunting too...
The tax on milling if very high and if they find a quern in a hut, they don't even spare children or women
- Now you will find the way yourself
- I will
- God reward you, worshipful master
- God be with you
- Who is there?
- Jurand of Spychow
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander Zygfryd de Lowe bids me to say to you that as long as you do not dismount the gates will not be opened
And your weapons are to be given up
Now, by Order of the Commander you have to put on this horse sack to hang the scabbard of your sword from your neck by a rope... and to wait in humility at the gate until the Commander orders it to be opened
My child
On your feet, dog.
The Commander orders you to appear before him
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander bade me to bring you in.
Follow me
- Have you no weapons on you?
- I gave them all up
Beware of bursting into anger.
You are under the force of the Commander
See how the power of the Order conquers malice and pride
- God grants it may always do so
- You bit the Order like a dog
God has caused you to stand before us like a dog with a rope round your neck
Do not compare me with a dog, for you deprive of honour those who have fought with me and perished by my hand
You still spit in pride
I am deprived of pride
By shaming my knighthood, you have shamed yourself
Do not complain that you have been shamed
Though you have been made a kennel man it is better to be the Order's kennel man than one of your knights
By the Passion of the Redeemer and everlasting Salvation, give me back my child as you promised
- Who promised you?
- You did
Commander
The word of a Knight of the Order is to be esteemed as the word of God
How so?
Will you not only let the girl go but also this mad dog to bite us anew?
I trusted Godfryd with this matter.
Be calm, my son
Well, you wolf.
You lapped our blood and now we pay you good for evil
I was hard on you but I was never treacherous
Here you have your child
This is not my daughter.
It is not her
It is not your daughter?
By St. Liborius of Paderborn it means it wasn't your child we rescued from the robbers for there is no other in Szczytno
There is.
I heard her sing
We are all witnesses that we are giving back the girl the robbers thought was Jurand of Spychow's daughter.
If that is not your daughter it is no fault of ours but the will of our Lord
God looks upon your treachery
By the wound of the Redeemer, by the hour of our death, ...give me back my child
If we give her back to you it will be with a bastard of mine
Spare him!
- On what are we taking counsel?
- On our defeat
On what the Grand Master and the Chapter will say and on the means of preventing our actions from harming our Order
- It still smells of blood here
- I ordered the floor to be washed
Where is brother Godfryd's body?
In the chapel.
The brethren are chanting litanies
- Where are the other corpses?
- In the snow to get them stiffened
- Is Jurand alive?
- He is alive
The soldiers wanted to finish him off but the Chaplain did not let them
It was a fatal idea to kidnap Jurand's daughter
Nobody will accuse us if the girl disappears
Pure reason speaks through brother Rotgier's mouth
Then even the Pope or the Roman emperor can take us to court
- What shall we do with the girl?
- Give her to me
No, my son.
When the Order is in question, renounce pleasure
Harden your hearts
Godfryd was reached by the hand of God for he desired not only to avenge the wrongs of the Order but also to satisfy his own lust
The time is near when the Order will be put to severe test
That is an evil night
You, brother de Bergow, will go to the Grand Master of Malbork
You have groaned in captivity with Jurand so they will more readily believe you
Say that before we entangled this madman in a net he managed to kill nine men and among them brother Godfryd
- God grant him everlasting rest
- Amen
And tell him that although we wanted to subdue an enemy of the Order yet none here was the first to draw sword against Jurand
I shall tell everything my eyes have seen
Are you quite certain Rotgier that nobody will learn the truth about Jurand's daughter?
Besides Godfryd, the both of us and the woman servant who watches her nobody knows we have her here
Godfryd ordered the men who brought her here to be hanged
Good
What will you do with Jurand's daughter?
I shall do whatever the good of the Order may require
Have you courage in your heart, my son?
Can you doubt it?
I do not doubt it
For your valiancy, I love you more than anyone in the world
Go then to Duke of Mazovia's court and tell him what happened here as we agreed between us
That's dangerous
It's for the good of the Order
But what if Jurand survives and regains his freedom?
Even though he regains his freedom he will never utter a word of complaint against the Order
Mindful of the Divine command we did not want to slay him although he slew many of our men, first of all brother Godfryd
At last we had to entangle him in a net then he raised the weapon and injured himself terribly
That night people in Szczytno heard laughter and voices calling in the air the enemy of the Cross, the shedder of innocent blood, our Jurand
You say you summoned Jurand to Szczytno?
Yes, gracious lady, when we rescued the crippled girl from the robbers we thought it was Jurand's daughter
How could you think that when you had seen Jurand's real daughter with me in Cracow?
We monks do not raise our eyes to women
Also, there were many maids with the gracious Duchess in Cracow
How did you know about the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
The audacity and godlessness of this deed made it known also among us
It is strange you would take the idiot-girl for Jurand's daughter
Perhaps Satan changed her
But robbers could not imitate Jurand's seal or the writing of his priest.
Who could do that?
An evil spirit.
These questions are like swords in my breast for suspicion is concealed behind them
I ask you, did Jurand himself accuse us of this deed?
His letter is available
That is true, there is Jurand's letter concerning robbers
See how the light of truth vanquishes darkness
Reward our losses and our blood, my Lord.
He was your subject
What do you want?
Jurand attacked you in madness.
Have I to be responsible for it?
My Lord, his land and fort in which he imprisoned servants of the Order, lie in your duchy
Let at least that become, henceforth, the Order's property
That payment will not bring our dead brothers to life but perhaps it will appease the divine anger and wipe out the disgrace
Haven't you got enough?
All these countries Eastern Pommerania, Prussia, the Chelmno county which belonged to us and are yours today
Jurand's daughter is still alive
For no-one has told us of her death and you want to rob her dowry
Jurand shed the blood of the brethren of the Order
You admitted the wrong, my Lord
So recompense us as your ducal conscience and your spirit of justice bids you
I come here as the Knight of the Most Holy Virgin ready to defend the honour of the Order with my own blood
If there is anyone, despite what Jurand said who dares to suspect the Order of kidnapping his daughter let him take up this knightly gage and venture on the wager of God's judgement
Is there anyone who will pick up that glove?
I will
Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
I take God as my witness, you, my distinguished Lord and the whole knighthood of this land that I am innocent of this blood that will be shed
They were men in combat according to law and custom in a knightly and proper manner
- Is he back?
- Not yet
But don't trouble yourself, commander for it is a judgement of God
- Judgement of God?
- Brother Rotgier is a famous knight
- But he should already be here
- He will return covered in new glory
Go and see who that is
Take the body to the chapel
Thus, they have sent him back
Is brother Rotgier already in the chapel?
Yes
Tell Diederich to come here with the keys and the lantern...
My coat
Let him also bring a brazier with charcoal
Dear son...
And you wrote to me that he was almost a child...
The whole arm
Many times you raised it for the Order's glory and now a Polish axe has hewn it off
The Lord did not bless you
Perhaps he does not care anymore for our Order
He has abandoned me also, although I have served Him my whole life
No, no, this is not possible, for we are in the right
Ours is the just cause
I do love you my son, and you will never speak again
Wait.
I will make you happy
Ready?
Once you told what brother Godfryd had ordered you to do and you lost your tongue
So, I tell you, that if with a single movement you show what you have done by my order, I will have you hanged
Do you understand?
Go on
On your knees, you dog
Get out
Light
You were promised that you would go free but the tongue with which you blasphemed will be torn out
Brother Rotgier is waiting.
I promised him to lay your right hand in his coffin
You still have one eye left
I only had you and now I have no-one
Listen, dear son, I vow to you I will lay the hand which slew you on your grave or perish myself
But before I get him I will make him suffer worse
He will not see that girl again
Who is there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Once I knelt under the headman's axe for I raised my sword against the Knights of the Order
Let the headsman cut off my head because I am going to raise it again
The Knights of the Order kidnapped Danusia
They drew Jurand into a trap
I will go alone and perish under their walls
Let the world know about the wrongs done by them
Order my head cut off but defend them, intercede for them with the Grand Master
Stop it.
Have you proved Jurand and his daughter were lured into a trap?
- Who else could have done it, my lord?
- Have you any witnesses?
Gracious lord, I have been informed that in the woods in Carpathia in a hut belonging to simple charcoal-burners Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine was lying wounded
I sincerely apologise, worshipful king, I am not able to make due homage
They stabbed me in my back and the wound has not healed
What has this to do with kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
I testify, gracious lord, that the monks from Szczytno discussed the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter
They stabbed me on the road like a wild boar because I wanted to prevent that mean trick
Will you repeat it in the presence of the Grand Master?
I witnessed here in Cracow against Jurand and now when the justice demands it I will witness against the monks from Szczytno...
Gracious lord...
Sir, accept my homage and my deep gratitude
Are you Zbyszko of Bogdaniec?
The most humble homage to the knight of the most beautiful girl in the world
If you deny it I will have to challenge you to combat on foot or on horse
Duchess Anna Danuta
Who is she, that most beautiful lady in the world?
Jagienka.
I can hardly believe my own eyes you look so beautiful.
How come you are in court?
My father has died.
The duchess agreed most kindly to protect me but I am always longing for Zgorzelice
Uncle, you are also here?
I have always told you, young boar, that she is like a deer, haven't I?
Noble Lord, the king asks you to come
Excuse me, sir
I have one more piece of bad news for you, my Lords
The Knights of the Teutonic Order robbed the ships loaded with grain which we sent to Lithuania
They spread rumours we supplied the Samogitians with arms
What does Jungingen want?
To sell our grain to the Lithuanians or start the war?
Is war inevitable?
Can we let them conquer Samogitia, Lithuania?
Will they stop after that?
The Order is an unconquered power
True, we will perish if we allow them to surprise us in a single battle
In alliance with Lithuania, Ruthenia and other peoples, we will win
Gracious Lord have I to speak truly or beautifully?
Do tell the truth, Castellan
Do you bid us, my king, to enter into an alliance with pagans and eastern schismatics against the Order?
Such plans do not correspond with a Christian leader
To weaken the Order means to weaken Christianity
You were to tell the truth, Castellan.
Do I want war?
Who blocks the way to overseas countries for our grain?
Who annexed Eastern Pommeranie?
If war breaks out, it will be a most cruel one and that is why we already think about the necessary preparations
But first we shall try to mitigate the matter
Castellans, Gracious Lords we shall summon the Order to give us back the ships with grain
Our envoys shall go to Malbork
How you have changed...
Sieur de Lorche would like to ask you, sir, whether that young lady is a mortal being or is she perhaps and angel?
Tell Sieur de Lorche it is an angel who chose a devilishly beautiful bodily cover for the time it stay among the mortals
Please, don't Zbyszko
What about Danusia?
Are there any news?
I do not know...
We are going to Malbork
The Gracious Lord agreed that you join us
Thank you, sir
- Uncle
- Yes...
- Jurand burdened me with Spychow
- Yes
In case I did not come back from Malbork please go to Spychow and defend the castle...
And who will dwell in Bogdaniec?
Just look at him.
He has a girl, who would crush all the nuts spread on the bench if she sat on them!
And he goes away into the world!
I beg you to do me this favour
If I am not back soon, go to Spychow
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Welcome Polish Knights
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Brother, lead the noble Polish lords and conceal nothing
Are these prisoners of war?
These are wretched rebels, heretics and pagans
They work here for the glory of God
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
My heart is full of joy, Gracious Lords that we sit together at one table, as it is fitting for good Christians...
Let us not allow the Samogitians to incite war between the Order and your king...
There is proof of all sorts of cruel outrages done by the brethren of the Order in Samogitia
I have already said in Cracow, the imperial privileges are not outrages
The charter says The Order of the Blessed Virgin is granted Lithuania, Prussia, Ruthenia and, in general all lands of the schismatics, which it can reach with its flags
That emperor was very generous indeed where the property of others was involved
May God forgive you this mockery
The emperor on earth is God's deputy where secular power is involved
His concern is to widen the areas of Christianity
We pray for the soul and eternal peace for your queen Jadwiga.
As long as she was alive there was harmony between us
The laws of the Holy Father were recognised and those of the emperors and their faithful servant, the Order, as well
Let us pray for peace for those living on earth
We are aware you prepare yourselves for war against the Order
We know your king ordered big hunting to take place further, that salted meat in barrels be prepared for the army
We ask you frankly, which side will you take when we proceed to Lithuania to defend our affairs to punish Samogitia for the godless rebellions
It is the Order that is a menace to Samogitia and Lithuania
Will you enter into an alliance with pagans?
Pax, pax among Christians
You are our guests
We have good will to listen to your complaints and to consider them
And it is our desire to entertain you with due respect
We want to entertain you as neighbours and friends
We have two infallible means to meet our enemies with a tower full of gold upstairs and iron which is forged downstairs
Just look...
The iron is excellent indeed...
But you do a lot of harm with this iron
- The Order is pious and just
- You said just, right?
And what fate met Jurand's daughter and that young knight?
What about the outrage done to Sieur de Lorche?
Does the Order have means to prevent it?
Sir, proceed to the Grand Master and lodge your complaint
And you also, sir
Welcome, Sieur de Lorche
How is that possible that we see you alive?
We have been told by the Commander of Szczytno that you have been attacked on the way to Cracow and killed
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd attacked me because I wanted to warn the Duke of Mazovia and this knight of Bogdaniec that they were going to kidnap the daughter of Jurand of Spychow
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd are dead
If they have done this crime against a guest of the Order Heaven has punished them justly
But neither the maid nor her father have been found
Jurand shed the knights' blood in Szczytno
He must suffer the punishment he deserves
Defenceless, he rushed upon people who kidnapped his daughter just as they once killed his wife
Your people deprived him of everything dearest to him
Various and wrong things happen on the borders
There is plenty of wickedness on both sides
I cannot believe that brothers from Szczytno acted in a way that did not conform to the vocation of monks and with the honour of German knights
This matter has to be thoroughly investigated
What about the annexation of ships for Lithuania.
You can't believe it either?
These vessels shipped arms for Witold.
Weapons against the Order
- There were no arms there
- There were.
You can see it
One weapon is like another
You say the Order is lying?
And do you believe your own words?
We shall return to this problem tomorrow
Concerning this girl, I shall give you a safe conduct letter to Szczytno and a monastery clerk, to accompany you
Thank you, sir
- What is the matter with you, sir?
- I can't breathe
I'm suffocating.
Take me out of here
Have you heard the complaint of this young knight and Sieur de Lorche's testimony?
Why do those who are posted on the border commanderies bring only shame upon the Order?
Jagiello requests the return of the ships and the exchange of prisoners
Jagiello enters into an alliance with the pagans
Whoever raises to destroy the Poles, deserves salvation
Christ, our Lord converted with words and not with swords
I warn you, brethren, the Order proceeds in an unjust manner far too often
There are rumours that the Prussians are rebelling
German towns are rising against us
Are we to wait till paganism and heresy absorb Christianity?
Idleness means perdition
Sometimes I think that war means perdition
Because you are ill and weak, Gracious Brother
We shall summon the most distinguished knights from all over Europe
We shall make known that those who will destroy the Poles and their king will deserve eternal life
What do you want?
In God's name, war!
- War!
- War!
War!
I tell you once more in the last hour of my life if the good of the Order is the concern of yours, be patient
Do not make war now
Poland, Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia will overthrow us
Give them back the ships...
What does that mean?
Sanderus
What are you doing here?
Be quiet, Gracious Lord.
The brethren should not learn we know each other
I've been to Szczytno.
Your damsel is there
How do you know?
From the chaplain, who is an honest man
She is watched now by Commander Zygfryd de Love
He did her no harm, for once.
When he wanted to do her wrong something pushed him down the staircase, he fainted and almost died
And now he is afraid of her
Do you hear, my Lord, the Grand Master died
What did you say?
The Grand Master died?
Yes, sir.
People say that now they will elect Ulrich the late Master's brother, God grant him everlasting rest
Thus, war is inevitable
I wish you, my Lord, that you may rule with justice, reason and in peace
We are here not for peace's sake but to fight for the faith against pagans and heathens
You have none to fight with, Gracious Lord for you are surrounded by Christian peoples only
True Christians do not support the faithless
What answer have we to take back to our king?
Will the ships with grain be given back to us?
Ships with weapons will become our legal booty
May I remind you, Gracious Lord about the promise made by your late brother and ask you for the safe-conduct letter to Szczytno?
The crew of Szczytno, with de Love set out to fight the rebellious Samogitia
You will find nobody there.
Wait until quieter times
Are you leaving, sir?
Perhaps it is better this way, for I can smell war here
That's true.
Zygfryd de Love and his crew set out for Samogitia
- I will search for him there
- You, for him, and I, for your damsel
He certainly hid her somewhere, to leave no trace
Give me, sir, one purse more and I will proceed from castle to castle and although this is dangerous, maybe I will learn something
Take it and go
It is time for us to bid farewell, sir
I wish you success in your noble search
If you have no objections, sir I would like to announce that Jagienka of Zgorzelice is the fairest and most virtuous lady in the world
Announce it wherever you wish, my Lord.
Perhaps it is even true
Jagienka
Back from Cracow already?
Have you heard something about Zbyszko?
I feel so restless.
The king's deputies came back without him from Malbork
- We were among the Teutonic Knights
- To look for something he'll never find
I have hardly begun to administer here and now I have to go
Among these scoundrels, the fate of Jurand or Danusia may befall him
- Take me with you.
I will help you
- You will help me indeed
You think when you cast off your skirt you will grow wiser
Wisdom is in the head.
Do you want Cztan or Wolf to take me?
They will not take you.
I made them both swear it Cztan, that he will defend you against Wolf and Wolf, that he will not give you to Cztan
Lord Jesus did not spare your cunningness
Everything will always be as you wish
If it were so, you would have long since been mistress of Bogdaniec
Why do you kiss me?
I am only saying goodnight.
We must start at dawn tomorrow
- Are you not afraid to go there?
- I am not.
I want to be near Zbyszko
If Danusia is lost, Zbyszko will be so grieved that he will not look at you
I do not want him to look at me.
I only want to be near him
Look at this giant
- That is no knight for he is going on foot
- He must be blind
He does not even have a dog.
We cannot leave him without help
Do you understand Christian language, old man?
- Get up
- What is the matter with you?
Can you speak?
He is trying to show that they have torn his tongue out
Who did that to you?
The Knights of the Teutonic Order
Are you from here?
From Mazovia?
What were you doing among the Teutonic Knights?
Do you come from Szczytno?
Were you not seeking your child there?
Then, you are Jurand of Spychow
The lord?
Teutonic Knights?
Let's go against the dog's brothers!
Will you fight against the peasants?
They are not the guilty ones
The Knights sit in their fortalices now
We will catch the Germans and throw them at our lord's feet
I am the uncle of Zbyszko of Bogdaniec and until he returns I give the orders here
- The lord went away two days ago
- Where to?
To the Samogitian frontier to search for the young lady
- The war is raging there.
- Then we missed one another
Hlawa?
Where is the lord?
- He keeps on discussing...
- Good...
Uncle.
What are you doing here?
I have been looking for you all over the world and at last I've found you
You thought I will sit in Bogdaniec till the end of my days
Jurand is in Spychow
The Teutonic Knights blinded him, tore out his tongue and cut off his right hand
Dreadful
And you?
Did you accomplish anything?
Have you found Danusia?
- No
- No?
This is my uncle, a knight from Bogdaniec
He has no equal on the battlefield
- Welcome, sir, be seated...
- Welcome
We want to attack the Germans
Two days ago we were near the castle at Nowe Kowno and they defeated us
- Defeated?
- Defeated...
We consider if it would be better to wait near Nowe Kowno, or go to Regneta
- Where is Nowe Kowno?
- About two miles from here
- And Regneta?
- Far northwards
It is good that it is far.
The Germans are not expecting us there
He is right
Exactly.
In the vicinity of Nowe Kowno they already defeated us
Because of that, they do not expect any attack
But Regneta is certainly less well-guarded
- He is right
- Where shall we make the ambush?
Here, near Nowe Kowno
You shall take position in the thickets above the highway and wait for the reinforcements on their way to the castle
200 people will not take part in the battle.
They will retreat
- I will attack from behind
- Cunning
The Teutonic Knights march and hide in a column
You can't destroy the columns with your bellies, can you?
You are wrong, uncle
It is the most courageous nation in the world
They are joyful, the accursed dogs
- At them!
- Attack!
Bind him.
Bind him
It's an important knight...
De Lorche
I recognised you
By the holy bones of St. Laurence.
I implore you, where is de Love?
- He escaped
- Is Jurand's daughter with him?
Jurand's daughter?
There is only an idiot-girl they had shown Jurand in Szczytno
How do you know it is an idiot-girl?
I heard her only, for she is ill and does not leave her wicker litter
Zygfryd had nothing to do with the kidnapping
- Right, yes!
- He is a faithful servant of the Order
And he was not aware of Rotgier and Godfryd's crimes
- Where have they escaped to?
- I do not know
It was agreed, in case we were attacked by somebody Zygfryd and his men will withdraw into a safe place till the battle ends
- Hear this?
- My Lord!
My Lord and defender, save me
But for you, the wolves would have devoured me or I would have fallen into the hands of those sons of Satan
My Lord, tell them to give me something to drink else you will be burdened with my innocent soul
Here, you drunkard
- Christ, our Lord, that is but mare's milk
- Then don't drink it
Thank you for taking me under your protection
You never refuse me any money or drink better than this mare's milk, which disgusts me but of which I will drink some more just to show that a pious pilgrim drinks from no mortification
Stop fooling around and tell me, do you know about Danusia?
Just a moment...
I have come to love you, Lord
When misfortune came upon you, I told myself I have to help you
Suffice to say that I found her and from that moment I have stuck to commander Zygfryd de Love as a bur sticks to a dog's tail...
- Is Danusia still alive?
- She is
He carries her in a wicker litter, fastened between two horses
That's the idiot-girl.
I told you de Love became odd after his son's death
What idiot-girl?
You told yourself, my Lord that your damsel has a lute
- Where are they?
- Certainly somewhere in the vicinity
De Love led the reinforcements which were marching towards Nowe Kowno
When he saw he fell into an ambush, he ordered a withdrawal
- Where could they find shelter?
- I do not know...
Perhaps by the potter deep in the woods, where we recently stopped
- To horses!
- Wait!
Wait!
Give me a horse I will ride ahead and will tell them I escaped from captivity
It will be safer this way.
I might be of some use to your damsel when you will attack Zygfryd de Love's men
Sir, don't believe that drunkard
Give him a horse.
He didn't betray me before, he will not betray me now
Sanderus
He purposely took their swords and cuirasses
- You take Zygfryd, he must be in the hut
- Good
- And I'll take that knight
- Yes
Hlawa...
You watch Danusia
- Forward
- Help
Bind him!
Bind him!
- What is the matter with you?
- Help me to my feet
Hold this
Danusia.
Danusia
- I am afraid
- Danusia.
It is me, Zbyszko
- I am afraid
- Danusia
It is me, Zbyszko.
Danusia
Danusia.
Danusia.
Danusia...
Let go of me.
I'll kill him like a dog
Scoundrel.
Would you stab a bound captive?
Danusia.
Do you recognise me?
Danusia
I am frightened
Listen, bitch, you'll dress the lady in clean garments and you will dress yourself in the rags which you have made her wear hitherto
Then we will choose a branch for you
- Danusia!
Defend me, help me!
- Get out!
Leave her alone!
They brought her to this state by torment
There you have the nobility of your Zygfryd
Let Jagienka know Danusia is ill and we have to ride slowly.
Go on
True, my Lord, your life in Poland is more difficult and complicated than I imagined living in Lorraine
Oh, yes.
You'll have to make the choice, my Lord
We can give you a guide to Cracow if you want to stay with us if not, the way to Malbork stays open
Farewell, my Lord, God willing, I will see you sometime again
Hey!
Take him
I was asked, Gracious Lord, to bring you Zygfryd de Love
Before you, my Lord, stands that hellhound, that Teutonic werewolf who tortured you and destroyed your child
Let me know what I am to do with him and how I am to punish him
To your knees, dog
What are you doing, sir?
You will not let this Beelzebub go, sir?
Do you want to give the captive his freedom?
Do you want him to go without vengeance and punishment?
For this purpose we chased him all over the world
He belongs to him.
He can do with him whatever he wants
Lord, if your will is to be fulfilled the captive must be conducted to the border
Here is our border and it is not far to yours
If the divine thunderbolt does not choke and blast you there is no danger to you from men
Go free
Stop!
- The flowers smell sweet
- Danusia
- Where am I?
- Near Spychow
Danusia, wait.
Oh merciful Jesus, wait, wait!
Danusia!
I sought her until I found her and rescued her but she preferred to go to God rather than to Spychow
So young, and death has mown her down
War!
War!
The dawn is not far off
The battle is about to begin
Repeat once more my orders!
You, Grand Duke!
The Lithuanian forces are on the right wing near Stebark
You, brother Ligngwan
The Smolensk companies are to be situated near the Polish wing the Mscislaw one in the middle of the Lithuanian forces and the Nowogrod regiment stays with me
And your men, Khan Dzelal-Eddin?
My men will go together with the Lithuanians
What about you, Jan of Lamberk?
The Czech companies will proceed with the Smolensk ones the rest of them together with Poles
And you, Lord Marshall?
According to your orders, Gracious King 60 men form your guard
The Cracow company will go in the middle of the left wing near Lodwigowe followed by companies from Sieradz and Poznan
I ordered to dig loop holes in front of our lines and to conceal them thoroughly
When the Polish heavy cavalry falls into these holes then our archers and our cannons will easily hit them for the bodies will make an excellent mark
Further, the knights' cavalry will attack from both sides
And what if the Poles will not advance first?
Jagiello is a reasonable leader
Jagiello and Witold are cunning and shrewd
But they are totally lacking the European knightly arts and customs
Their people lack the soldiers discipline they get excited easily, they will certainly first attack us
No.
The heavy armed knights will enter the battle at last
As first the Tartars and the light Lithuanian cavalry will proceed
The Lithuanians and Tartars, with their skins and wooden shields will not resist the pressure of the Teutonic Knight clad in steel armour
But the Lithuanians and Tartars will make a reconnaissance to check if no ambush was prepared.
I know this is dangerous
We conquered in all battles using our stratagem
We shall crush them at once with our heavy horses and equipment
We shall take every precaution
First the loop holes, then cannons and archers and at the end, I shall lead 16 squadrons myself
I shall fight together with you
As it is fitting for a true knight
The leader should not go into the fighting crowd because he will not be able to command
According to eastern customs, the leader commands on a hill in order to see the whole battlefield
Right you are, Grand Duke
True, in the East they use to fight like this
The sun is already up...
It's time to take our positions.
Lead out the men-at-arms
No.
They will wait in the woods.
Do not hurry
It will be easier to form the rank and bear the heavy armour in the shadow
You want us to hide in the bushes
We want to fight openly, as it befits true knights
- I will not stop my warriors
- You will wait!
Even you will not stop them, Gracious Lord.
What do you bid us to do?
You will obey my orders.
Wait!
Let Father Bartosz prepare for Mass.
Two Masses
And you will wait in the woods!
Let us greet the sun
How many of the pagans are hiding in the woods?
I suppose about one hundred thousand
Thus, it will be the biggest battle of our times
We do not know how big their forces are
But they had never before brought together such power
Perhaps about one hundred thousand
What is the name of the village in front of the camp of the Teutonic Knights?
Grunwald...
Before these barbarians form ranks, we will occupy the best positions
And there look there, brethren, the guests of the Order occupy their positions
The flower of the European knighthood
The rest is in God's hands
He will support His faithful servants
The rest is in God's hands.
He will support His faithful servants
Gracious Lord, the Germans are marching
To arms, brethren!
The task will be bloody but we will secure the rule of Christianity in the East for a millennium
The Grand Master of the Order
My Lords, let us go to Mass
Gracious Lord.
With the Knights of the Teutonic Order
The knights from Bavaria, Swabia and France
Cancel the Mass.
Give me a horse
My king, the knights from Rhineland, from Frisian England
They hide in the woods
They are better at handling spoons than swords...
You do not know them.
The Poles do not lack courage but their king is hoping to receive the offer of peace at the last minute
Shame.
The whole power of the Order is afraid of the Poles
I prefer death and so I will be quite alone
I will charge the Polish army with these swords
This is contrary to discipline
Advise me how to draw the enemy out of the woods
King.
The heralds of the Teutonic Order are riding towards our camp
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold, to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
Grand Master Ulrich bids us also to inform you that if the field of battle seems too small for you he will withdraw his armies somewhat so that you need not loiter in the thickets
We have enough swords, but we will take these as an omen of victory
Couriers...
Withdraw the heavy squadrons, they are not the first to enter.
Stop!
Stop!
It is the king's order, turn back
Stop!
You do not enter first.
Stop!
Turn back!
It is the king's order.
Turn back, turn back!
Couriers to Duke Witold, to Dzebal Eddin
Lithuania!
Lucifer swallow them, they managed to get out
It's Witold's light cavalry...
Wallendrod!
Now begin, in God's name
We will trample our archers!
Begin
- Our knights will trample us down!
- They will trample us down!
King.
Come to the rescue.
Save our army
Lichtenstein...
Attack!
Attack!
The Kalisz and Sieradz companies, proceed to support the right wing
Proceed immediately to support Mazovia
The company is in peril
Powala, three companies proceed around through Ludwikowo and attack
Turn back and follow me
We will make a circuit and charge in a flank
Zyndram, let the infantry attack
- At them!
Attack!
- At the enemy!
- Forward!
- At them!
Kuno Lichtenstein, do you recognise me?
Yes, I do
I vowed that I would find you and meet you
Stand!
- To the death, with no quarter
- Stand!
Take off the helmet
Stand your ground, you dog!
That is he, who this very morning thought himself superior to all the powers of the earth
Jagna?
Jagna!
Jagna
THE END
- Is he back?
- Not yet
But don't trouble yourself, commander for it is a judgement of God
- Judgement of God?
- Brother Rotgier is a famous knight
- But he should already be here
- He will return covered in new glory
Go and see who that is
Take the body to the chapel
Thus, they have sent him back
Is brother Rotgier already in the chapel?
Yes
Tell Diederich to come here with the keys and the lantern...
My coat
Let him also bring a brazier with charcoal
Dear son...
And you wrote to me that he was almost a child...
The whole arm
Many times you raised it for the Order's glory and now a Polish axe has hewn it off
The Lord did not bless you
Perhaps he does not care anymore for our Order
He has abandoned me also, although I have served Him my whole life
No, no, this is not possible, for we are in the right
Ours is the just cause
I do love you my son, and you will never speak again
Wait.
I will make you happy
Ready?
Once you told what brother Godfryd had ordered you to do and you lost your tongue
So, I tell you, that if with a single movement you show what you have done by my order, I will have you hanged
Do you understand?
Go on
On your knees, you dog
Get out
Light
You were promised that you would go free but the tongue with which you blasphemed will be torn out
Brother Rotgier is waiting.
I promised him to lay your right hand in his coffin
You still have one eye left
I only had you and now I have no-one
Listen, dear son, I vow to you I will lay the hand which slew you on your grave or perish myself
But before I get him I will make him suffer worse
He will not see that girl again
Who is there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Once I knelt under the headman's axe for I raised my sword against the Knights of the Order
Let the headsman cut off my head because I am going to raise it again
The Knights of the Order kidnapped Danusia
They drew Jurand into a trap
I will go alone and perish under their walls
Let the world know about the wrongs done by them
Order my head cut off but defend them, intercede for them with the Grand Master
Stop it.
Have you proved Jurand and his daughter were lured into a trap?
- Who else could have done it, my lord?
- Have you any witnesses?
Gracious lord, I have been informed that in the woods in Carpathia in a hut belonging to simple charcoal-burners Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine was lying wounded
I sincerely apologise, worshipful king, I am not able to make due homage
They stabbed me in my back and the wound has not healed
What has this to do with kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
I testify, gracious lord, that the monks from Szczytno discussed the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter
They stabbed me on the road like a wild boar because I wanted to prevent that mean trick
Will you repeat it in the presence of the Grand Master?
I witnessed here in Cracow against Jurand and now when the justice demands it I will witness against the monks from Szczytno...
Gracious lord...
Sir, accept my homage and my deep gratitude
Are you Zbyszko of Bogdaniec?
The most humble homage to the knight of the most beautiful girl in the world
If you deny it I will have to challenge you to combat on foot or on horse
Duchess Anna Danuta
Who is she, that most beautiful lady in the world?
Jagienka.
I can hardly believe my own eyes you look so beautiful.
How come you are in court?
My father has died.
The duchess agreed most kindly to protect me but I am always longing for Zgorzelice
Uncle, you are also here?
I have always told you, young boar, that she is like a deer, haven't I?
Noble Lord, the king asks you to come
Excuse me, sir
I have one more piece of bad news for you, my Lords
The Knights of the Teutonic Order robbed the ships loaded with grain which we sent to Lithuania
They spread rumours we supplied the Samogitians with arms
What does Jungingen want?
To sell our grain to the Lithuanians or start the war?
Is war inevitable?
Can we let them conquer Samogitia, Lithuania?
Will they stop after that?
The Order is an unconquered power
True, we will perish if we allow them to surprise us in a single battle
In alliance with Lithuania, Ruthenia and other peoples, we will win
Gracious Lord have I to speak truly or beautifully?
Do tell the truth, Castellan
Do you bid us, my king, to enter into an alliance with pagans and eastern schismatics against the Order?
Such plans do not correspond with a Christian leader
To weaken the Order means to weaken Christianity
You were to tell the truth, Castellan.
Do I want war?
Who blocks the way to overseas countries for our grain?
Who annexed Eastern Pommeranie?
If war breaks out, it will be a most cruel one and that is why we already think about the necessary preparations
But first we shall try to mitigate the matter
Castellans, Gracious Lords we shall summon the Order to give us back the ships with grain
Our envoys shall go to Malbork
How you have changed...
Sieur de Lorche would like to ask you, sir, whether that young lady is a mortal being or is she perhaps and angel?
Tell Sieur de Lorche it is an angel who chose a devilishly beautiful bodily cover for the time it stay among the mortals
Please, don't Zbyszko
What about Danusia?
Are there any news?
I do not know...
We are going to Malbork
The Gracious Lord agreed that you join us
Thank you, sir
- Uncle
- Yes...
- Jurand burdened me with Spychow
- Yes
In case I did not come back from Malbork please go to Spychow and defend the castle...
And who will dwell in Bogdaniec?
Just look at him.
He has a girl, who would crush all the nuts spread on the bench if she sat on them!
And he goes away into the world!
I beg you to do me this favour
If I am not back soon, go to Spychow
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Welcome Polish Knights
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Brother, lead the noble Polish lords and conceal nothing
Are these prisoners of war?
These are wretched rebels, heretics and pagans
They work here for the glory of God
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
My heart is full of joy, Gracious Lords that we sit together at one table, as it is fitting for good Christians...
Let us not allow the Samogitians to incite war between the Order and your king...
There is proof of all sorts of cruel outrages done by the brethren of the Order in Samogitia
I have already said in Cracow, the imperial privileges are not outrages
The charter says The Order of the Blessed Virgin is granted Lithuania, Prussia, Ruthenia and, in general all lands of the schismatics, which it can reach with its flags
That emperor was very generous indeed where the property of others was involved
May God forgive you this mockery
The emperor on earth is God's deputy where secular power is involved
His concern is to widen the areas of Christianity
We pray for the soul and eternal peace for your queen Jadwiga.
As long as she was alive there was harmony between us
The laws of the Holy Father were recognised and those of the emperors and their faithful servant, the Order, as well
Let us pray for peace for those living on earth
We are aware you prepare yourselves for war against the Order
We know your king ordered big hunting to take place further, that salted meat in barrels be prepared for the army
We ask you frankly, which side will you take when we proceed to Lithuania to defend our affairs to punish Samogitia for the godless rebellions
It is the Order that is a menace to Samogitia and Lithuania
Will you enter into an alliance with pagans?
Pax, pax among Christians
You are our guests
We have good will to listen to your complaints and to consider them
And it is our desire to entertain you with due respect
We want to entertain you as neighbours and friends
We have two infallible means to meet our enemies with a tower full of gold upstairs and iron which is forged downstairs
Just look...
The iron is excellent indeed...
But you do a lot of harm with this iron
- The Order is pious and just
- You said just, right?
And what fate met Jurand's daughter and that young knight?
What about the outrage done to Sieur de Lorche?
Does the Order have means to prevent it?
Sir, proceed to the Grand Master and lodge your complaint
And you also, sir
Welcome, Sieur de Lorche
How is that possible that we see you alive?
We have been told by the Commander of Szczytno that you have been attacked on the way to Cracow and killed
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd attacked me because I wanted to warn the Duke of Mazovia and this knight of Bogdaniec that they were going to kidnap the daughter of Jurand of Spychow
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd are dead
If they have done this crime against a guest of the Order Heaven has punished them justly
But neither the maid nor her father have been found
Jurand shed the knights' blood in Szczytno
He must suffer the punishment he deserves
Defenceless, he rushed upon people who kidnapped his daughter just as they once killed his wife
Your people deprived him of everything dearest to him
Various and wrong things happen on the borders
There is plenty of wickedness on both sides
I cannot believe that brothers from Szczytno acted in a way that did not conform to the vocation of monks and with the honour of German knights
This matter has to be thoroughly investigated
What about the annexation of ships for Lithuania.
You can't believe it either?
These vessels shipped arms for Witold.
Weapons against the Order
- There were no arms there
- There were.
You can see it
One weapon is like another
You say the Order is lying?
And do you believe your own words?
We shall return to this problem tomorrow
Concerning this girl, I shall give you a safe conduct letter to Szczytno and a monastery clerk, to accompany you
Thank you, sir
- What is the matter with you, sir?
- I can't breathe
I'm suffocating.
Take me out of here
Have you heard the complaint of this young knight and Sieur de Lorche's testimony?
Why do those who are posted on the border commanderies bring only shame upon the Order?
Jagiello requests the return of the ships and the exchange of prisoners
Jagiello enters into an alliance with the pagans
Whoever raises to destroy the Poles, deserves salvation
Christ, our Lord converted with words and not with swords
I warn you, brethren, the Order proceeds in an unjust manner far too often
There are rumours that the Prussians are rebelling
German towns are rising against us
Are we to wait till paganism and heresy absorb Christianity?
Idleness means perdition
Sometimes I think that war means perdition
Because you are ill and weak, Gracious Brother
We shall summon the most distinguished knights from all over Europe
We shall make known that those who will destroy the Poles and their king will deserve eternal life
What do you want?
In God's name, war!
- War!
- War!
War!
I tell you once more in the last hour of my life if the good of the Order is the concern of yours, be patient
Do not make war now
Poland, Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia will overthrow us
Give them back the ships...
What does that mean?
Sanderus
What are you doing here?
Be quiet, Gracious Lord.
The brethren should not learn we know each other
I've been to Szczytno.
Your damsel is there
How do you know?
From the chaplain, who is an honest man
She is watched now by Commander Zygfryd de Love
He did her no harm, for once.
When he wanted to do her wrong something pushed him down the staircase, he fainted and almost died
And now he is afraid of her
Do you hear, my Lord, the Grand Master died
What did you say?
The Grand Master died?
Yes, sir.
People say that now they will elect Ulrich the late Master's brother, God grant him everlasting rest
Thus, war is inevitable
I wish you, my Lord, that you may rule with justice, reason and in peace
We are here not for peace's sake but to fight for the faith against pagans and heathens
You have none to fight with, Gracious Lord for you are surrounded by Christian peoples only
True Christians do not support the faithless
What answer have we to take back to our king?
Will the ships with grain be given back to us?
Ships with weapons will become our legal booty
May I remind you, Gracious Lord about the promise made by your late brother and ask you for the safe-conduct letter to Szczytno?
The crew of Szczytno, with de Love set out to fight the rebellious Samogitia
You will find nobody there.
Wait until quieter times
Are you leaving, sir?
Perhaps it is better this way, for I can smell war here
That's true.
Zygfryd de Love and his crew set out for Samogitia
- I will search for him there
- You, for him, and I, for your damsel
He certainly hid her somewhere, to leave no trace
Give me, sir, one purse more and I will proceed from castle to castle and although this is dangerous, maybe I will learn something
Take it and go
It is time for us to bid farewell, sir
I wish you success in your noble search
If you have no objections, sir I would like to announce that Jagienka of Zgorzelice is the fairest and most virtuous lady in the world
Announce it wherever you wish, my Lord.
Perhaps it is even true
Jagienka
Back from Cracow already?
Have you heard something about Zbyszko?
I feel so restless.
The king's deputies came back without him from Malbork
- We were among the Teutonic Knights
- To look for something he'll never find
I have hardly begun to administer here and now I have to go
Among these scoundrels, the fate of Jurand or Danusia may befall him
- Take me with you.
I will help you
- You will help me indeed
You think when you cast off your skirt you will grow wiser
Wisdom is in the head.
Do you want Cztan or Wolf to take me?
They will not take you.
I made them both swear it Cztan, that he will defend you against Wolf and Wolf, that he will not give you to Cztan
Lord Jesus did not spare your cunningness
Everything will always be as you wish
If it were so, you would have long since been mistress of Bogdaniec
Why do you kiss me?
I am only saying goodnight.
We must start at dawn tomorrow
- Are you not afraid to go there?
- I am not.
I want to be near Zbyszko
If Danusia is lost, Zbyszko will be so grieved that he will not look at you
I do not want him to look at me.
I only want to be near him
Look at this giant
- That is no knight for he is going on foot
- He must be blind
He does not even have a dog.
We cannot leave him without help
Do you understand Christian language, old man?
- Get up
- What is the matter with you?
Can you speak?
He is trying to show that they have torn his tongue out
Who did that to you?
The Knights of the Teutonic Order
Are you from here?
From Mazovia?
What were you doing among the Teutonic Knights?
Do you come from Szczytno?
Were you not seeking your child there?
Then, you are Jurand of Spychow
The lord?
Teutonic Knights?
Let's go against the dog's brothers!
Will you fight against the peasants?
They are not the guilty ones
The Knights sit in their fortalices now
We will catch the Germans and throw them at our lord's feet
I am the uncle of Zbyszko of Bogdaniec and until he returns I give the orders here
- The lord went away two days ago
- Where to?
To the Samogitian frontier to search for the young lady
- The war is raging there.
- Then we missed one another
Hlawa?
Where is the lord?
- He keeps on discussing...
- Good...
Uncle.
What are you doing here?
I have been looking for you all over the world and at last I've found you
You thought I will sit in Bogdaniec till the end of my days
Jurand is in Spychow
The Teutonic Knights blinded him, tore out his tongue and cut off his right hand
Dreadful
And you?
Did you accomplish anything?
Have you found Danusia?
- No
- No?
This is my uncle, a knight from Bogdaniec
He has no equal on the battlefield
- Welcome, sir, be seated...
- Welcome
We want to attack the Germans
Two days ago we were near the castle at Nowe Kowno and they defeated us
- Defeated?
- Defeated...
We consider if it would be better to wait near Nowe Kowno, or go to Regneta
- Where is Nowe Kowno?
- About two miles from here
- And Regneta?
- Far northwards
It is good that it is far.
The Germans are not expecting us there
He is right
Exactly.
In the vicinity of Nowe Kowno they already defeated us
Because of that, they do not expect any attack
But Regneta is certainly less well-guarded
- He is right
- Where shall we make the ambush?
Here, near Nowe Kowno
You shall take position in the thickets above the highway and wait for the reinforcements on their way to the castle
200 people will not take part in the battle.
They will retreat
- I will attack from behind
- Cunning
The Teutonic Knights march and hide in a column
You can't destroy the columns with your bellies, can you?
You are wrong, uncle
It is the most courageous nation in the world
They are joyful, the accursed dogs
- At them!
- Attack!
Bind him.
Bind him
It's an important knight...
De Lorche
I recognised you
By the holy bones of St. Laurence.
I implore you, where is de Love?
- He escaped
- Is Jurand's daughter with him?
Jurand's daughter?
There is only an idiot-girl they had shown Jurand in Szczytno
How do you know it is an idiot-girl?
I heard her only, for she is ill and does not leave her wicker litter
Zygfryd had nothing to do with the kidnapping
- Right, yes!
- He is a faithful servant of the Order
And he was not aware of Rotgier and Godfryd's crimes
- Where have they escaped to?
- I do not know
It was agreed, in case we were attacked by somebody Zygfryd and his men will withdraw into a safe place till the battle ends
- Hear this?
- My Lord!
My Lord and defender, save me
But for you, the wolves would have devoured me or I would have fallen into the hands of those sons of Satan
My Lord, tell them to give me something to drink else you will be burdened with my innocent soul
Here, you drunkard
- Christ, our Lord, that is but mare's milk
- Then don't drink it
Thank you for taking me under your protection
You never refuse me any money or drink better than this mare's milk, which disgusts me but of which I will drink some more just to show that a pious pilgrim drinks from no mortification
Stop fooling around and tell me, do you know about Danusia?
Just a moment...
I have come to love you, Lord
When misfortune came upon you, I told myself I have to help you
Suffice to say that I found her and from that moment I have stuck to commander Zygfryd de Love as a bur sticks to a dog's tail...
- Is Danusia still alive?
- She is
He carries her in a wicker litter, fastened between two horses
That's the idiot-girl.
I told you de Love became odd after his son's death
What idiot-girl?
You told yourself, my Lord that your damsel has a lute
- Where are they?
- Certainly somewhere in the vicinity
De Love led the reinforcements which were marching towards Nowe Kowno
When he saw he fell into an ambush, he ordered a withdrawal
- Where could they find shelter?
- I do not know...
Perhaps by the potter deep in the woods, where we recently stopped
- To horses!
- Wait!
Wait!
Give me a horse I will ride ahead and will tell them I escaped from captivity
It will be safer this way.
I might be of some use to your damsel when you will attack Zygfryd de Love's men
Sir, don't believe that drunkard
Give him a horse.
He didn't betray me before, he will not betray me now
Sanderus
He purposely took their swords and cuirasses
- You take Zygfryd, he must be in the hut
- Good
- And I'll take that knight
- Yes
Hlawa...
You watch Danusia
- Forward
- Help
Bind him!
Bind him!
- What is the matter with you?
- Help me to my feet
Hold this
Danusia.
Danusia
- I am afraid
- Danusia.
It is me, Zbyszko
- I am afraid
- Danusia
It is me, Zbyszko.
Danusia
Danusia.
Danusia.
Danusia...
Let go of me.
I'll kill him like a dog
Scoundrel.
Would you stab a bound captive?
Danusia.
Do you recognise me?
Danusia
I am frightened
Listen, bitch, you'll dress the lady in clean garments and you will dress yourself in the rags which you have made her wear hitherto
Then we will choose a branch for you
- Danusia!
Defend me, help me!
- Get out!
Leave her alone!
They brought her to this state by torment
There you have the nobility of your Zygfryd
Let Jagienka know Danusia is ill and we have to ride slowly.
Go on
True, my Lord, your life in Poland is more difficult and complicated than I imagined living in Lorraine
Oh, yes.
You'll have to make the choice, my Lord
We can give you a guide to Cracow if you want to stay with us if not, the way to Malbork stays open
Farewell, my Lord, God willing, I will see you sometime again
Hey!
Take him
I was asked, Gracious Lord, to bring you Zygfryd de Love
Before you, my Lord, stands that hellhound, that Teutonic werewolf who tortured you and destroyed your child
Let me know what I am to do with him and how I am to punish him
To your knees, dog
What are you doing, sir?
You will not let this Beelzebub go, sir?
Do you want to give the captive his freedom?
Do you want him to go without vengeance and punishment?
For this purpose we chased him all over the world
He belongs to him.
He can do with him whatever he wants
Lord, if your will is to be fulfilled the captive must be conducted to the border
Here is our border and it is not far to yours
If the divine thunderbolt does not choke and blast you there is no danger to you from men
Go free
Stop!
- The flowers smell sweet
- Danusia
- Where am I?
- Near Spychow
Danusia, wait.
Oh merciful Jesus, wait, wait!
Danusia!
I sought her until I found her and rescued her but she preferred to go to God rather than to Spychow
War!
War!
The dawn is not far off
The battle is about to begin
Repeat once more my orders!
You, Grand Duke!
The Lithuanian forces are on the right wing near Stebark
You, brother Ligngwan
The Smolensk companies are to be situated near the Polish wing the Mscislaw one in the middle of the Lithuanian forces and the Nowogrod regiment stays with me
And your men, Khan Dzelal-Eddin?
My men will go together with the Lithuanians
What about you, Jan of Lamberk?
The Czech companies will proceed with the Smolensk ones the rest of them together with Poles
And you, Lord Marshall?
According to your orders, Gracious King 60 men form your guard
The Cracow company will go in the middle of the left wing near Lodwigowe followed by companies from Sieradz and Poznan
I ordered to dig loop holes in front of our lines and to conceal them thoroughly
When the Polish heavy cavalry falls into these holes then our archers and our cannons will easily hit them for the bodies will make an excellent mark
Further, the knights' cavalry will attack from both sides
And what if the Poles will not advance first?
Jagiello is a reasonable leader
Jagiello and Witold are cunning and shrewd
But they are totally lacking the European knightly arts and customs
Their people lack the soldiers discipline they get excited easily, they will certainly first attack us
No.
The heavy armed knights will enter the battle at last
As first the Tartars and the light Lithuanian cavalry will proceed
The Lithuanians and Tartars, with their skins and wooden shields will not resist the pressure of the Teutonic Knight clad in steel armour
But the Lithuanians and Tartars will make a reconnaissance to check if no ambush was prepared.
I know this is dangerous
We conquered in all battles using our stratagem
We shall crush them at once with our heavy horses and equipment
We shall take every precaution
First the loop holes, then cannons and archers and at the end, I shall lead 16 squadrons myself
I shall fight together with you
As it is fitting for a true knight
The leader should not go into the fighting crowd because he will not be able to command
According to eastern customs, the leader commands on a hill in order to see the whole battlefield
Right you are, Grand Duke
True, in the East they use to fight like this
The sun is already up...
It's time to take our positions.
Lead out the men-at-arms
No.
They will wait in the woods.
Do not hurry
It will be easier to form the rank and bear the heavy armour in the shadow
You want us to hide in the bushes
We want to fight openly, as it befits true knights
- I will not stop my warriors
- You will wait!
Even you will not stop them, Gracious Lord.
What do you bid us to do?
You will obey my orders.
Wait!
Let Father Bartosz prepare for Mass.
Two Masses
And you will wait in the woods!
Let us greet the sun
How many of the pagans are hiding in the woods?
I suppose about one hundred thousand
Thus, it will be the biggest battle of our times
We do not know how big their forces are
But they had never before brought together such power
Perhaps about one hundred thousand
What is the name of the village in front of the camp of the Teutonic Knights?
Grunwald...
Before these barbarians form ranks, we will occupy the best positions
And there look there, brethren, the guests of the Order occupy their positions
The flower of the European knighthood
The rest is in God's hands
He will support His faithful servants
The rest is in God's hands.
He will support His faithful servants
Gracious Lord, the Germans are marching
To arms, brethren!
The task will be bloody but we will secure the rule of Christianity in the East for a millennium
The Grand Master of the Order
My Lords, let us go to Mass
Gracious Lord.
With the Knights of the Teutonic Order
The knights from Bavaria, Swabia and France
Cancel the Mass.
Give me a horse
My king, the knights from Rhineland, from Frisian England
They hide in the woods
They are better at handling spoons than swords...
You do not know them.
The Poles do not lack courage but their king is hoping to receive the offer of peace at the last minute
Shame.
The whole power of the Order is afraid of the Poles
I prefer death and so I will be quite alone
I will charge the Polish army with these swords
This is contrary to discipline
Advise me how to draw the enemy out of the woods
King.
The heralds of the Teutonic Order are riding towards our camp
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold, to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
Grand Master Ulrich bids us also to inform you that if the field of battle seems too small for you he will withdraw his armies somewhat so that you need not loiter in the thickets
We have enough swords, but we will take these as an omen of victory
Couriers...
Withdraw the heavy squadrons, they are not the first to enter.
Stop!
Stop!
It is the king's order, turn back
Stop!
You do not enter first.
Stop!
Turn back!
It is the king's order.
Turn back, turn back!
Couriers to Duke Witold, to Dzebal Eddin
Lithuania!
Lucifer swallow them, they managed to get out
It's Witold's light cavalry...
Wallendrod!
Now begin, in God's name
We will trample our archers!
Begin
- Our knights will trample us down!
- They will trample us down!
King.
Come to the rescue.
Save our army
Lichtenstein...
Attack!
Attack!
The Kalisz and Sieradz companies, proceed to support the right wing
Proceed immediately to support Mazovia
The company is in peril
Powala, three companies proceed around through Ludwikowo and attack
Turn back and follow me
We will make a circuit and charge in a flank
Zyndram, let the infantry attack
- At them!
Attack!
- At the enemy!
- Forward!
- At them!
Kuno Lichtenstein, do you recognise me?
Yes, I do
I vowed that I would find you and meet you
Stand!
- To the death, with no quarter
- Stand!
Take off the helmet
Stand your ground, you dog!
That is he, who this very morning thought himself superior to all the powers of the earth
Jagna?
Jagna!
Jagna
THE END
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage, which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER
- Whom are you carrying with you?
- Who are you?
Out of the way!
Lower your lance, knave
- This is Count Jurand of Spychow
- Save us, oh Lord
We are merchants from Plock.
We carried grain from the mill
They broke the Order's laws
Traffic is allowed here only upon the consent of Commander Zygfryd de Lowe
I am the master here.
Let them go
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pious Commander.
We detained the Polish carts loaded with grain
But we were attacked later on
- By whom?
- By Jurand of Spychow
Father, give us your permission
Danusia.
Danusia
Danusia!
Close the gates.
The gates
It's raining.
It's raining
Thank you, oh Lord, for saving us
Open the gates
Teutonic Knights
- Are you Jurand's woman?
- I am master of Spychow's wife
Mother.
O, my mother
Mother!
I will take vengeance over you, my wife.
I will
- You there, innkeeper
- Yes, sir?
Clear the tables and bring in the candles Duchess Anna Danuta is stopping here for a rest
Magda, Magda, clear the tables.
Out with you, beggars.
Go away!
This company is too distinguished for us
Let us go
Be seated, young boar
It is not too distinguished for us.
We are gentle-folk
Hey, Danusia rejoice our hearts with the same song you sang at Zator
- Who is that?
- A maiden from the duchess' court
I thought she was an angel.
What do they call her?
Danusia.
Her father is Jurand of Spychow.
She is an orphan
Why, Jurand is still alive
The Knights of the Teutonic Order killed her mother
Jurand was out hunting when they came to Spychow
A German with a peacock feather on his helmet tied her to his saddle
She turned pale and died on the rope
There is Danusia's knight
Thank you
Worshipful lady, I wish to make my vow to that maiden
Do you wish her to be your lady?
But who are you?
That is my nephew, worshipful lady, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
- And you, sir?
- I am Macko of Bogdaniec
We were in Lithuania, fighting under the command of your brother, Duke Witold
- Were you wounded?
- No.
But we took splendid booty
Are you not boasting by any chance?
Let us see that booty
Fighting the knights from the Frisian country we made an agreement
Whoever wins should take the wagons and cuirass of the defeated there were few suits of armour and costly garments for my nephew
Do you want him to be your knight, Danusia?
I do
I vow to tear some peacocks crests from the German helmets like those of the knight who killed your mother had, and lay them at your feet
- Foolish you are, young boar
- I have vowed
The only way to get booty is to fight under Duke Witold against the Tartars
I have to get German crests.
Where shall I find them among the Tartars?
You will find captives there
Who will cultivate the land in Bogdaniec?
- I have vowed
- Because you are stupid
Duchess Ryngalla poisoned the duke and she was absolved
- We have enough money
- I have vowed
Where will you find the German crests?
Where?
Lower your lance...
Madman.
It is Grand Master's envoy to our majesty the king
- Who are you?
- I am Powala of Taczewo, you fool
You insulted our king.
You'll pay for that with your head
I welcome thee, dear Duke and Duchess of Mazovia
I welcome thee, dear brother Lingwen, Duke of Mscislaw and Nowogrod
I welcome thee, noble envoys of the Grand Master
I welcome thee gracious fathers and all the guests at our court in Cracow the Ruthenian boyars and the Polish Knights
Try to win the king's heart.
It is up to him to pardon you or cut your head off
That wild Lithuanian drinks only mare's milk
- Don't you drink, Gracious Lord?
- No.
Springwater only
Thus, you give a good example, Gracious Lord
A still better one is given by those who act nobly
That is you, Gracious Lord
His most worshipful Majesty, the Grand Master of the Blessed Virgin order aimed to let Your Majesty know gracious King, with all due respect and esteem that not only the Lithuanians but also many Poles help the rebelling pagans in Samogitia
Our people and the people from Ruthenia...
We have privileges from the Holy Father
His Holiness Urban IV gave his consent to the Order of the Blessed Virgin to sell agricultural products, but not for profit
We vowed poverty as monks but our Order is compelled to fight with pagans
The Order builds castles, mills
Who can say there is no order and fear of God in the lands belonging to us?
Order and fear of God?
And on the border, steady confusion and fires
But in our land we hold Christian laws in esteem.
We do not insult the envoys
Whom are you referring to, noble knight?
Has somebody insulted you in Poland?
I did, Gracious Lord
If the Teutonic Knight demands punishment, let there be punishment
But Zbyszko is the last in our line.
If he is no more, we shall be no more
Allow me, sir, to give my head for his
Law crushes the guilty, but it is not a dragon which laps the blood of a man without looking whose it is
What about the Teutonic Knights' justice?
Samogitia.
Swords, robbery
- They have privileges granted
- Let's fight them!
It is the booty you are after
We will not expose Poland to a conflict with the Order of the Blessed Virgin
Thus you will cut off my nephews' head?
We will.
We shall act according to the law
Ask Lichtenstein for mercy.
Only he can withdraw his complaint
That is true.
I was wearing my suit of armour
Thus, you could have defended yourself, sir
It is a suit of armour one wears only when paying solemn visits
Piercing this metal plate with a blade would surely deprive one of his life
Was it your intention to kill Squire von Lichtenstein?
It was.
As long as he was alive I could not get the crest
But I called to him from a distance to lower his lance
If he had called that he was an envoy, I would have left him in peace
True.
Why did he not call out?
Can you swear on the Passion of our Lord that you did not see his cloak and the cross?
I cannot.
I should certainly not have attacked our knight
I knew it was a Knight of the Teutonic Order
How could there be any other Teutonic Knight in the vicinity of Cracow, except for an envoy or one of his colour?
Commander von Lichtenstein
- Pardon him
- I do pardon him
From the bottom of my heart, as a servant of Christ and a monk
- Praise be to him
- But I am here as an envoy
So he who has wronged an envoy, has insulted the Order and insulted Christ Himself
And such a wrongdoing I cannot forgive
Kneel down
God... be merciful to me
The noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec is condemned by the Castellan's sentence to be beheaded with the sword
- Danusia
- Don't be mournful.
The Castellan agreed to postpone the execution
- What good will it do?
- Isn't it hard for you?
One week sooner, one later...
- What is the weather like outside?
- The sun is shining
Almighty God!
If I could mount a horse and ride through the vast fields!
It is hard for you...
Sing me a song
If I could be saved, my maiden...
We have to go, my lady
The duchess wrote a letter to the Grand Master
The king will pardon you if the Grand Master intercedes in your favour
Macko went to Malbork with the letter.
May he only arrive in time
Stop.
It is not a Saracen.
Are you a Christian?
I am.
Honestly like a knight and you are like a robber
I am Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine and I joined the Order to fight the Saracens
I thought there are no fools in Lorraine.
Saracens here?
You stupid man.
We have been Christians for ages
What about the Mazurians?
Don't make a fool out of me
I have been shown wooden Mazurian idols in Malbork
Let me give him the last blow.
He is a Mazurian
To arms!
Jurand!
Kill them
Help me.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, please help me
- Spare him.
He's not a Teutonic Knight
- He fought against us
Who are you?
Macko of Bogdaniec.
Whom have I to thank for the rescue?
I am Jurand of Spychow
Jesus...
- Who are you?
- De Bergow.
You must know about me
The pious Commander of Szczytno will offer a ransom for me
- We are in Spychow
- You are Jurand
I don't take ransoms
No Teutonic Knight will leave this place on his own feet
Bind him in chains and put him in the dungeon
- And what about him, sir?
- I am Count de Lorche
He is not a Teutonic Knight.
He is a knight from Lorraine
They came here to fight Saracens.
You offered him to me, sir
What will you do with him?
My nephew's life is in the hands of the Grand Master
I was on my way to Malbork with a letter from the Duchess of Mazovia and he wounded me
Let him pay for it now
A splinter is sticking between your ribs.
There's not much time left for you
I cannot help it...
I must go to Cracow
Now I shall not escape death.
They'll cut off my head
Most certainly.
But don't be mournful
I will have such an oak coffin made for you that even the lords of the crown have no better
I won't even allow them to behead you on the same cloth they use for the townsfolk
I have already agreed with the merchant Amyley to give you a quite new one, scarlet good enough for the king to use to line his fur coat with
And I won't grudge you masses.
Never fear
God reward you, uncle
- Uncle?
- Yes, Zbyszko?
- I want you to make me a promise
- A promise?
When they cut my head off, take a mighty woman for yourself
What?
Are you mad?
You said it yourself.
Our line must not die out
- Look.
Do you see?
- Do you spit blood like that all the time?
A splinter two inches long is sticking between my ribs
I am going to die before winter comes
- Only you yourself can save your life
- What?
Have you heard about Duke Witold?
How he was imprisoned in Krewa and escaped disguised in women's clothes?
Now, take my leather jacket, take my hood and go, understand?
Here you have the ransom the Teutons paid for this de Lorche from Lorraine...
Then they'll cut off your head instead of mine
Good for them.
I'll die anyway in two or three weeks' time
- Take it
- I won't do that
I wish you had never been born
Listen it was not a shame for Duke Witold to escape in that way it will not be a shame for you
Duke Witold is a grand duke
He has received a crown from the king's hands, he has wealth and lordship
And I, poor nobleman, have nothing but my honour
Don't you understand that I love you and won't give your head for mine?
May the cross-wolves perish if children are to be executed through them
Shame, shame...
Stop!
Stop!
He doesn't belong to the headman.
He's mine, he's mine
She threw her veil over him.
It's an old custom.
He is hers
Let's go to the castle.
To the Castellan
Pagan country, pagan customs
It is true.
Such ancient customs exist
But it is more suited to the robbers of the Carpathian foothills and to the simple folk
Ask Father Stanislaw, he knows everything about laws and customs
One should have asked the Grand Master
It was his envoy who was insulted
The ancient, folk customs became law
Gracious Duchess.
The betrothal must take place at once if I am to honour this custom
Gracious Duke, we offer these humble gifts to you, the truly Christian lord and our Order's friend
Don't bear a grudge because of the petty conflicts and quarrels and the inconsiderate and passionate deeds committed by youngsters
You may assure the Grand Master we are his true friends and defenders of our common faith
The pious Grand Commander Zygfryd de Lowe of Szczytno wants to lodge a complaint to be considered by your Serene Highness not because of "youngsters"
Jurand of Spychow, your Serene Highness, attacked our people
He slaughtered and wounded many.
He took brother de Bergow captive
We have here the noble witness, Lord Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine who is the Order's guest
He has also been cruelly injured by Jurand...
Who is this most beautiful maiden in the world?
Fascinating indeed
She is the daughter of Jurand, the man who aimed to kill you
Hot paternal blood
Against a girl like that I'll fight most gladly
Border disputes... the pious knight de Love accuses the Count of Spychow while the noble Jurand accuses the Grand Commander of Szczytno
It is not only this complaint we ask you to consider, your Serene Highness
The Grand Master would like to get acquainted with your opinion concerning the alliance of King Jagiello with the heathens
And with the schismatics from Ruthenia as well
The Grand Master sends you this holy relic the same the gracious Duchess asked for the forefinger of St. Onufry who died a glorious death, killed by the pagans
I told you to go with this mission to Cracow and to negotiate there
- The Duke of Mazovia is benevolent
- But he will not give us Jurand
- Jurand will beg at our gates, my father
- What have you said, my son?
I said, my father, Jurand will come to us on his knees to get his daughter back
- I do not understand
- Do you want to kidnap his daughter?
She is the daughter of the most rancorous enemy of the Order
You barely escaped him with your own life
It does not agree with the knightly gospel and honour
We are destined to live on the borders, in forests
Doomed is the one who is not able to repay a blow with a blow
Listen.
She is still a child.
Don't force me to warn them
- You will not do it, sir
- I will, so help me God...
You won't...
Give him the last blow...
It is not necessary after I worked upon him
Proceed, sir, I will join you
Forgive him, Lord Jesus, his sins and grant him everlasting rest
Why, oh Lord, to spread Thy rule to defend Thy home, we have to make so much injustice
You will certainly not bring me alive to Bogda...
- Water...
- Stampeding horses!
To the woods!
To the woods!
You intruded unnecessarily, I would have managed
- Hlawa.
Take the horse
- Zych
Zych...
At last...
Good gracious
Thus, you returned to your Bogdaniec
- I did, didn't I, just to die here
- What is wrong?
Jagna, it's our neighbour Macko of Bogdaniec
Come here
- Who is that?
- Did you not recognise Zbyszko?
Zbyszko?
Jagna, come here
Quickly.
Give him a kiss, for old times' sake
Am I already at death's door, Father?
I tried to pull out the splinter, but I failed
- He failed.
Zych?
- Yes, brother?
Do you have much land of your own?
Thanks to good husbandry three malets and about 50 men
And Jagna?
Jagna, how old is she?
She is now so attracted to boys that when she sees them she rubs one knee against the other
Zych, you lied, you have 70 men
- What is that to you?
- If Zbyszko takes your Jagna...
Well, well.
Let me hear your confession, it may be too late later
Tell me the truth, as in the face of God.
How many men have you?
- Will he live, sir?
- God willing
But the priest advised to try to heal him with bear's fat
Hlawa.
Have you brought bear's fat?
- No, my lady.
The dogs ate it all up
- I will look for some in the tree-hives
I've been told I could easily find one there
It's dangerous.
Take our Hlawa with you
To frighten the bear away?
No
God have mercy...
Use your axe
- Who are you?
- Jagienka
I don't know what would have happened if it was not for you
Leave me alone.
Will you?
A lad of ours also went with a fork and an axe and the bear tore him to pieces
Thus, I went after you
- Then it was you there under the pines?
- Yes
There cannot be another girl like you in the world
- You ought to go to the war
- Don't laugh at me
Wait.
We'd better get a beaver at once because when the wound opens you have to stop it with beaver's fat and the sickness will leave him
- Where are the beaver's lodges?
- Come
Did you heard me sing, when you laid in wait for the bear?
- It was you?
- Yes
These woods belong to Cztan of Rogow
- The man who would like to marry you?
- If only I would let him!
I've been told that Cztan grinds his teeth at Wolf your other neighbour who would like to marry you too
Oh, yes
- Foolish lads
- Why?
When your father was away one of them should have taken you from Zgorzelice
What if your father had come back and found you with a child?
Let them try.
You think I don't know how to grasp a spear or a crossbow?
I would have driven each of them home again and raided their villages
If I were Cztan or Wolf, I would not be afraid of your father or you
- But I would have taken you
- You would have?
Why should a girl fight with lads when she ought to marry
Don't be stupid.
Be quiet
There are the beavers, in the warm spring
- I've got it, I've got it
- I am going for it
Don't.
The mud is deep.
Anyone unfamiliar with it will certainly drown
- Then how will you get it?
- Don't worry about it.
Let's go
I've left my arrows in the willow.
Wait
- Hey, what a cunning girl you are
- Oh, go away
Squeeze out the water from my plait
- And I was waiting for you like a fool
- Was I to undress in front of you?
- That would be something to marvel at
- Be quiet.
Take the beaver
Give it
- Zbyszko
- Yes?
I will marry neither Cztan nor Wolf
God will give you the best man possible.
You will be worthy of him
In a couple of weeks, Macko will be able to mount a horse
I am waiting for that as for salvation.
It is hard for me to stay here
- Why?
- Were you told about Danusia?
I heard something.
I know she covered you with a veil
I know every knight vows some deed, even the married ones
- But this Danusia, who is she?
- I will tell you, as I would my own sister
For her sake I would cross the ninth river and the ninth sea
I will fulfil what I have vowed to her, unless I die first
- Is it true?
- It is
I did not realise that.
Hlawa...
May God reward you for everything, my girl
Hlawa will help you to get the beavers.
I am going back home
What the deuce!
Who has killed him?
Wait...
He is still breathing.
- It's not worth it.
He'll die in no time
- Let's help him
Leave him.
If he recovers, it will bring us trouble
And so his purse and sword...
He'll reward us happily with the purse when he recovers, and besides we gain merit in heaven for rescuing a Christian.
Let's take him
You fool.
It's a mere loss of time
Go on.
Take him
Perhaps he'll survive
An urgent message for the gracious Duchess from the Count of Spychow
Nothing but bad news.
A part of the fortalice had been burned in Spychow
Jesus
Father Kaleb writes, the Count of Spychow may recover but the sparks and coals so burned his only eye that little light was left in it and he is threatened with blindness
That is why the Count of Spychow...
summons Danusia to come to him for he wants to see her again before darkness overwhelms him
He also humbly thanks the Duchess for raising the girl like a daughter and he promises that he would come to Ciechanow for Christmas to fall at the lady's feet and beg her favour and support for Danusia for the future
Come nearer
I do not know you.
Why hasn't Tolima come?
He was injured in a recent fight with the Germans
The Count begs for the swift return of his daughter since he may be blind soon
Gracious lady, we have to go back as soon as the horses have rested
We shall meet your neighbours, Cztan and Wolf, at Krzesnia
- Show them to me from a distance
- I will, Zbyszko
They will meet you in front of the church.
What will they do?
Attend me as best they know
They will not attend to you today, understand?
That's them
- What now?
- Well, what?
- Shall we at once...
- How can you fall on him in church?
Not in church but after Mass
That's her father.
Do you remember what he said?
If we started a fight he would banish us from Zgorzelice
If it were not for that, I would have broken your ribs long ago
Or I yours
Let's better break his together
- Let's do it
- After Mass
Hurry up
- Woe is me
- To the inn
I have to pay for the mass for my uncle's health.
I'll go back
- We'll send money from Zgorzelice
- I have to go back
Go.
God be with you
If either of you two denies that the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the world is Danusia Jurand of Spychow's daughter I will challenge him to fight on horseback or on foot, until death
What?
You dog's brother.
Jagienka is not the most beautiful
He is mocking
That's what you knights are like?
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
Where is Zbyszko?
He went back to the church.
He forgot to pay for the Mass
Daddy.
Perhaps we will send a couple of lads to Krzesnia?
- What for?
- The quarrel has broken out there
What quarrel?
Whom is he to fight with?
Cztan and Wolf, he'll fight for me
If so, let them fight
- You've done it quickly, how was it?
- I just paid for the Mass
- Haven't you been in the inn?
- I have
- Well, and what happened?
- Nothing
Now my uncle feels better, I shall go to Mazovia
- To Danusia?
- I have vowed
You vowed to get a peacock's crest
I vowed to take her for my wife.
God grant you health and all the best
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
- I am your servant, my Lord
- My servant?
Lady Jagienka of Zgorzelice gave me to you
- Go back home.
I don't want you
- I will not go back, sir
I am a prisoner of war from Boleslawice.
I was given to you
- Thus, you are mine?
- Yours, my Lord
Then, I order you to go back
Lady Jagienka sent you this too
Go away.
Do you want me to break your bones?
- What is your name?
- In Czech, Hlawa.
In Polish, Big Head
Give me the cape
Christians, save a servant of God
Whoever you are, sir, help a servant of God
Who are you?
Sanderus.
My horse ran away, I was left alone without weapons
A wild beast may appear any moment in the forest
I shall perish if you do not save me
Give him a horse
May God multiply your victories, valiant knight
Hey, innkeeper.
We want to wait until the snowstorm is over
Welcome travellers from far away
Get out of here
I am dead-cold.
Order a flask of wine for me
For two or three gulps, I shall excuse you a month in purgatory
He looks like a drunkard
Beware of everlasting damnation.
You are speaking to a man who ate hard-boiled eggs with the Holy Father last Easter
How can you write me off a month of purgatory if you are not ordained?
I have obtained permission to sell pardons and relics
- Where are you from?
- Under the Prussian lords, from Malbork
You speak our language well What do they call you?
I am a German and my name is Sanderus
I was born at Torun, where all folk speak like that
Even the brothers of the Order understand your language
Innkeeper.
Bring warm beer
- Is it long since you left Malbork?
- Long enough
I have been in the Holy Land then I returned to Malbork and now I carry the holy relics and pardons which pious Christians buy for their soul's salvation
Where have you got those holy wares from?
I have plenary pardons, pardons for 500 years, for 300 and cheaper ones, so that even poor people can buy them and thus shorten the pains of purgatory for themselves...
I have pardons for past sins and for the future ones but I don't keep the money I get for them
A piece of black bread and a drink of water is enough for me
The remainder of what I get I take to Rome to help them to collect in time for a new crusade
And these relics?
Are they important ones?
Such that it is not fitting even to talk of them without taking your hat off
I have a shoe of the ass ridden on by the Holy Family on their flight into Egypt
I have a feather from archangel Gabriel's wing which he lost during the Annunciation
I have some of the oil in which the pagans boiled St. John
I have a rung of the ladder Jacob saw in his dreams and a phial containing wind, which was blowing in the Bethlehem stable
Is the storm over?
Why, no, I suppose we will have to spend Christmas Eve here
Saddle the horses.
Let's go
It's very dangerous now, my Lord, the roads are buried in snow
I have to reach the Duke of Mazovia before Christmas Eve
They will wait, my Lord, and here we may lose our way and perish
You can stay here, you drunkard
I can't.
Who will defend my holy goods?
Don't go, my Lord
- We rode off the highway
- I warned you
- Let's go
- The horses will not go on
Everything is going wrong, my Lord.
One can't see the highway any more
There is a man under the snow
It will snow us over too, my Lord
It will snow us over too, it will snow us over
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
It will snow us over!
Some men...
light...
There are some men there
- Hey!
- You there!
Hey!
Hey!
Is anybody there?
Who are you?
The Duke of Mazovia's men.
We have been sent to help travellers
Follow me, there are some people buried there
It is Jurand
Give me a torch
Rub him with snow
Gracious Lord.
Jurand of Spychow has been found under the snow
You found him?
Bring him here
Danusia?
We tried to find her.
Have you left her back at Spychow?
I was going to her, to Ciechanow...
Why, you have sent men with a letter for her.
Wake up!
By God's mercy, where is my child?
Listen.
There came an armed troop with a letter from you saying that you were injured during a fire
Woe to me.
They have seized my child and they will destroy her
Who?
The Teutonic Knights... de Lowe Godfryd...
Rotgier...
- Was it you who dug me out?
- With the others
- Are you going to help me now?
- Your daughter saved me from death
- Do you love her?
- I belong to her forever...
Even if I have to bite Prussian castles with my teeth, I'll get her
Do you know what the vengeance of the brothers of the Order is?
And now to Spychow
My Lord.
Some monks are waiting for you here
They were bustling about Spychow.
They want to speak with you
- Who are you?
- Pilgrims
- Where from?
- From Szczytno
Where is my child?
He who sent us ordered us not to speak with you in the presence of witnesses
I have no secrets before these men
But we have.
If you bid them to stay we will have to depart
Since it has to be so, you remain alone
Your daughter was kidnapped by robbers
With crosses on their cloaks?
No.
But God blessed the brethren, they rescued her and now she is with them
Where?
Under the protection of the pious brother Szomberg
Szomberg.
The one who strangled Witold's children
He takes good care of her and she will not be harmed
What have I to do to get her back?
- Humble yourself before the Order
- Silence!
- Have you a letter?
- No
We say what we have to say
Nothing evil will happen to your daughter.
The brethren will repay you good for evil if you satisfy their just demands
- What do they want?
- Brother de Bergow released
I will release him
And all the other prisoners you still have at Spychow
I will not bargain for my child
But that is not all
To protect the good name of the Order, the brethren add another condition
You will declare to the Duke and to the whole knighthood that it was robbers who kidnapped your daughter and that you had to pay a ransom to get her back
It is true that robbers kidnapped my child and that I must pay a ransom to them to get her back
You will say that you took a ransom from de Bergow to pay the robbers
I have never taken a ransom
For it was never a question of your child
Or do something else
You may come to Szczytno yourself for your daughter
I?
To Szczytno?
For robbers may again kidnap her on the way and the suspicion will fall on the pious brethren
Who will guarantee my return from Szczytno?
The virtue of the brethren, their justice and piety
I will come to Szczytno.
But both of you will stay here until my return and then you will go with Bergow and the prisoners
You don't want to trust the monks so why should they trust you?
Whoever you are, do not test my patience
Say what you were ordered to say
The brethren told us you have to go to Szczytno without saying a word
Did they not tell you I would break you with a wheel in Spychow?
Your daughter is in the hands of the brethren
What did they want?
Tell us
Are you sick, my Lord?
What news of Danusia?
With what proposal have they come?
With a ransom.
For de Bergow
Where is Danusia?
She is not with the Teutonic Knights
Come closer
He is destined for my daughter and thus he is to be lord here after my death
You will serve him faithfully in peace and in war
Have you heard?
Dear God.
Why are you giving me Spychow already?
I am giving you Danusia
The hour of death is unknown
Where is the master?
- What are your grace's commands?
- I ask you where the master is?
- He is gone
- Where to?
I do not know.
He went heavily armed
The highway will be on the right, beyond the woods and from the knoll you'll see the castle at once
From the knoll, you say?
The castle?
You are not a German, sir, are you?
They did not pay their taxes
The brethren need a lot of money for the war with Samogitis
After the war against the Samogitians is over, they will start another one
Fishing is forbidden hunting too...
The tax on milling if very high and if they find a quern in a hut, they don't even spare children or women
- Now you will find the way yourself
- I will
- God reward you, worshipful master
- God be with you
- Who is there?
- Jurand of Spychow
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander Zygfryd de Lowe bids me to say to you that as long as you do not dismount the gates will not be opened
And your weapons are to be given up
Now, by Order of the Commander you have to put on this horse sack to hang the scabbard of your sword from your neck by a rope... and to wait in humility at the gate until the Commander orders it to be opened
My child
On your feet, dog.
The Commander orders you to appear before him
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander bade me to bring you in.
Follow me
- Have you no weapons on you?
- I gave them all up
Beware of bursting into anger.
You are under the force of the Commander
See how the power of the Order conquers malice and pride
- God grants it may always do so
- You bit the Order like a dog
God has caused you to stand before us like a dog with a rope round your neck
Do not compare me with a dog, for you deprive of honour those who have fought with me and perished by my hand
You still spit in pride
I am deprived of pride
By shaming my knighthood, you have shamed yourself
Do not complain that you have been shamed
Though you have been made a kennel man it is better to be the Order's kennel man than one of your knights
By the Passion of the Redeemer and everlasting Salvation, give me back my child as you promised
- Who promised you?
- You did
Commander
The word of a Knight of the Order is to be esteemed as the word of God
How so?
Will you not only let the girl go but also this mad dog to bite us anew?
I trusted Godfryd with this matter.
Be calm, my son
Well, you wolf.
You lapped our blood and now we pay you good for evil
I was hard on you but I was never treacherous
Here you have your child
This is not my daughter.
It is not her
It is not your daughter?
By St. Liborius of Paderborn it means it wasn't your child we rescued from the robbers for there is no other in Szczytno
There is.
I heard her sing
We are all witnesses that we are giving back the girl the robbers thought was Jurand of Spychow's daughter.
If that is not your daughter it is no fault of ours but the will of our Lord
God looks upon your treachery
By the wound of the Redeemer, by the hour of our death, ...give me back my child
If we give her back to you it will be with a bastard of mine
Spare him!
- On what are we taking counsel?
- On our defeat
On what the Grand Master and the Chapter will say and on the means of preventing our actions from harming our Order
- It still smells of blood here
- I ordered the floor to be washed
Where is brother Godfryd's body?
In the chapel.
The brethren are chanting litanies
- Where are the other corpses?
- In the snow to get them stiffened
- Is Jurand alive?
- He is alive
The soldiers wanted to finish him off but the Chaplain did not let them
It was a fatal idea to kidnap Jurand's daughter
Nobody will accuse us if the girl disappears
Pure reason speaks through brother Rotgier's mouth
Then even the Pope or the Roman emperor can take us to court
- What shall we do with the girl?
- Give her to me
No, my son.
When the Order is in question, renounce pleasure
Harden your hearts
Godfryd was reached by the hand of God for he desired not only to avenge the wrongs of the Order, but also to satisfy his own lust
The time is near when the Order will be put to severe test
That is an evil night
You, brother de Bergow, will go to the Grand Master of Malbork
You have groaned in captivity with Jurand so they will more readily believe you
Say that before we entangled this madman in a net he managed to kill nine men and among them brother Godfryd
- God grant him everlasting rest
- Amen
And tell him that although we wanted to subdue an enemy of the Order yet none here was the first to draw sword against Jurand
I shall tell everything my eyes have seen
Are you quite certain Rotgier that nobody will learn the truth about Jurand's daughter?
Besides Godfryd, the both of us and the woman servant who watches her nobody knows we have her here
Godfryd ordered the men who brought her here to be hanged
Good
What will you do with Jurand's daughter?
I shall do whatever the good of the Order may require
Have you courage in your heart, my son?
Can you doubt it?
I do not doubt it
For your valiancy, I love you more than anyone in the world
Go then to Duke of Mazovia's court and tell him what happened here as we agreed between us
That's dangerous
It's for the good of the Order
But what if Jurand survives and regains his freedom?
Even though he regains his freedom he will never utter a word of complaint against the Order
Mindful of the Divine command we did not want to slay him although he slew many of our men, first of all brother Godfryd
At last we had to entangle him in a net then he raised the weapon and injured himself terribly
That night people in Szczytno heard laughter and voices calling in the air the enemy of the Cross, the shedder of innocent blood, our Jurand
You say you summoned Jurand to Szczytno?
Yes, gracious lady, when we rescued the crippled girl from the robbers we thought it was Jurand's daughter
How could you think that when you had seen Jurand's real daughter with me in Cracow?
We monks do not raise our eyes to women
Also, there were many maids with the gracious Duchess in Cracow
How did you know about the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
The audacity and godlessness of this deed made it known also among us
It is strange you would take the idiot-girl for Jurand's daughter
Perhaps Satan changed her
But robbers could not imitate Jurand's seal or the writing of his priest.
Who could do that?
An evil spirit.
These questions are like swords in my breast for suspicion is concealed behind them
I ask you, did Jurand himself accuse us of this deed?
His letter is available
That is true, there is Jurand's letter concerning robbers
See how the light of truth vanquishes darkness
Reward our losses and our blood, my Lord.
He was your subject
What do you want?
Jurand attacked you in madness.
Have I to be responsible for it?
My Lord, his land and fort in which he imprisoned servants of the Order, lie in your duchy
Let at least that become, henceforth, the Order's property
That payment will not bring our dead brothers to life but perhaps it will appease the divine anger and wipe out the disgrace
Haven't you got enough?
All these countries Eastern Pommerania, Prussia, the Chelmno county which belonged to us and are yours today
Jurand's daughter is still alive
For no-one has told us of her death and you want to rob her dowry
Jurand shed the blood of the brethren of the Order
You admitted the wrong, my Lord
So recompense us as your ducal conscience and your spirit of justice bids you
I come here as the Knight of the Most Holy Virgin ready to defend the honour of the Order with my own blood
If there is anyone, despite what Jurand said who dares to suspect the Order of kidnapping his daughter let him take up this knightly gage and venture on the wager of God's judgement
Is there anyone who will pick up that glove?
I will
Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
I take God as my witness, you, my distinguished Lord and the whole knighthood of this land that I am innocent of this blood that will be shed
They were men in combat according to law and custom in a knightly and proper manner
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage, which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER
- Whom are you carrying with you?
- Who are you?
Out of the way!
Lower your lance, knave
- This is Count Jurand of Spychow
- Save us, oh Lord
We are merchants from Plock.
We carried grain from the mill
They broke the Order's laws
Traffic is allowed here only upon the consent of Commander Zygfryd de Lowe
I am the master here.
Let them go
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pious Commander.
We detained the Polish carts loaded with grain
But we were attacked later on
- By whom?
- By Jurand of Spychow
Father, give us your permission
Danusia.
Danusia
Danusia!
Close the gates.
The gates
It's raining.
It's raining
Thank you, oh Lord, for saving us
Open the gates
Teutonic Knights
- Are you Jurand's woman?
- I am master of Spychow's wife
Mother.
O, my mother
Mother!
I will take vengeance over you, my wife.
I will
- You there, innkeeper
- Yes, sir?
Clear the tables and bring in the candles Duchess Anna Danuta is stopping here for a rest
Magda, Magda, clear the tables.
Out with you, beggars.
Go away!
This company is too distinguished for us
Let us go
Be seated, young boar
It is not too distinguished for us.
We are gentle-folk
Hey, Danusia rejoice our hearts with the same song you sang at Zator
- Who is that?
- A maiden from the duchess' court
I thought she was an angel.
What do they call her?
Danusia.
Her father is Jurand of Spychow.
She is an orphan
Why, Jurand is still alive
The Knights of the Teutonic Order killed her mother
Jurand was out hunting when they came to Spychow
A German with a peacock feather on his helmet tied her to his saddle
She turned pale and died on the rope
There is Danusia's knight
Thank you
Worshipful lady, I wish to make my vow to that maiden
Do you wish her to be your lady?
But who are you?
That is my nephew, worshipful lady, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
- And you, sir?
- I am Macko of Bogdaniec
We were in Lithuania, fighting under the command of your brother, Duke Witold
- Were you wounded?
- No.
But we took splendid booty
Are you not boasting by any chance?
Let us see that booty
Fighting the knights from the Frisian country we made an agreement
Whoever wins should take the wagons and cuirass of the defeated there were few suits of armour and costly garments for my nephew
Do you want him to be your knight, Danusia?
I do
I vow to tear some peacocks crests from the German helmets like those of the knight who killed your mother had, and lay them at your feet
- Foolish you are, young boar
- I have vowed
The only way to get booty is to fight under Duke Witold against the Tartars
I have to get German crests.
Where shall I find them among the Tartars?
You will find captives there
Who will cultivate the land in Bogdaniec?
- I have vowed
- Because you are stupid
Duchess Ryngalla poisoned the duke and she was absolved
- We have enough money
- I have vowed
Where will you find the German crests?
Where?
Lower your lance...
Madman.
It is Grand Master's envoy to our majesty the king
- Who are you?
- I am Powala of Taczewo, you fool
You insulted our king.
You'll pay for that with your head
I welcome thee, dear Duke and Duchess of Mazovia
I welcome thee, dear brother Lingwen, Duke of Mscislaw and Nowogrod
I welcome thee, noble envoys of the Grand Master
I welcome thee gracious fathers and all the guests at our court in Cracow the Ruthenian boyars and the Polish Knights
Try to win the king's heart.
It is up to him to pardon you or cut your head off
That wild Lithuanian drinks only mare's milk
- Don't you drink, Gracious Lord?
- No.
Springwater only
Thus, you give a good example, Gracious Lord
A still better one is given by those who act nobly
That is you, Gracious Lord
His most worshipful Majesty, the Grand Master of the Blessed Virgin order aimed to let Your Majesty know gracious King, with all due respect and esteem that not only the Lithuanians but also many Poles help the rebelling pagans in Samogitia
Our people and the people from Ruthenia...
We have privileges from the Holy Father
His Holiness Urban IV gave his consent to the Order of the Blessed Virgin to sell agricultural products, but not for profit
We vowed poverty as monks but our Order is compelled to fight with pagans
The Order builds castles, mills
Who can say there is no order and fear of God in the lands belonging to us?
Order and fear of God?
And on the border, steady confusion and fires
But in our land we hold Christian laws in esteem.
We do not insult the envoys
Whom are you referring to, noble knight?
Has somebody insulted you in Poland?
I did, Gracious Lord
If the Teutonic Knight demands punishment, let there be punishment
But Zbyszko is the last in our line.
If he is no more, we shall be no more
Allow me, sir, to give my head for his
Law crushes the guilty, but it is not a dragon which laps the blood of a man without looking whose it is
What about the Teutonic Knights' justice?
Samogitia.
Swords, robbery
- They have privileges granted
- Let's fight them!
It is the booty you are after
We will not expose Poland to a conflict with the Order of the Blessed Virgin
Thus you will cut off my nephews' head?
We will.
We shall act according to the law
Ask Lichtenstein for mercy.
Only he can withdraw his complaint
That is true.
I was wearing my suit of armour
Thus, you could have defended yourself, sir
It is a suit of armour one wears only when paying solemn visits
Piercing this metal plate with a blade would surely deprive one of his life
Was it your intention to kill Squire von Lichtenstein?
It was.
As long as he was alive I could not get the crest
But I called to him from a distance to lower his lance
If he had called that he was an envoy, I would have left him in peace
True.
Why did he not call out?
Can you swear on the Passion of our Lord that you did not see his cloak and the cross?
I cannot.
I should certainly not have attacked our knight
I knew it was a Knight of the Teutonic Order
How could there be any other Teutonic Knight in the vicinity of Cracow, except for an envoy or one of his colour?
Commander von Lichtenstein
- Pardon him
- I do pardon him
From the bottom of my heart, as a servant of Christ and a monk
- Praise be to him
- But I am here as an envoy
So he who has wronged an envoy, has insulted the Order and insulted Christ Himself
And such a wrongdoing I cannot forgive
Kneel down
God... be merciful to me
The noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec is condemned by the Castellan's sentence to be beheaded with the sword
- Danusia
- Don't be mournful.
The Castellan agreed to postpone the execution
- What good will it do?
- Isn't it hard for you?
One week sooner, one later...
- What is the weather like outside?
- The sun is shining
Almighty God!
If I could mount a horse and ride through the vast fields!
It is hard for you...
Sing me a song
If I could be saved, my maiden...
We have to go, my lady
The duchess wrote a letter to the Grand Master
The king will pardon you if the Grand Master intercedes in your favour
Macko went to Malbork with the letter.
May he only arrive in time
Stop.
It is not a Saracen.
Are you a Christian?
I am.
Honestly like a knight and you are like a robber
I am Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine and I joined the Order to fight the Saracens
I thought there are no fools in Lorraine.
Saracens here?
You stupid man.
We have been Christians for ages
What about the Mazurians?
Don't make a fool out of me
I have been shown wooden Mazurian idols in Malbork
Let me give him the last blow.
He is a Mazurian
To arms!
Jurand!
Kill them
Help me.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, please help me
- Spare him.
He's not a Teutonic Knight
- He fought against us
Who are you?
Macko of Bogdaniec.
Whom have I to thank for the rescue?
I am Jurand of Spychow
Jesus...
- Who are you?
- De Bergow.
You must know about me
The pious Commander of Szczytno will offer a ransom for me
- We are in Spychow
- You are Jurand
I don't take ransoms
No Teutonic Knight will leave this place on his own feet
Bind him in chains and put him in the dungeon
- And what about him, sir?
- I am Count de Lorche
He is not a Teutonic Knight.
He is a knight from Lorraine
They came here to fight Saracens.
You offered him to me, sir
What will you do with him?
My nephew's life is in the hands of the Grand Master
I was on my way to Malbork with a letter from the Duchess of Mazovia and he wounded me
Let him pay for it now
A splinter is sticking between your ribs.
There's not much time left for you
I cannot help it...
I must go to Cracow
Now I shall not escape death.
They'll cut off my head
Most certainly.
But don't be mournful
I will have such an oak coffin made for you that even the lords of the crown have no better
I won't even allow them to behead you on the same cloth they use for the townsfolk
I have already agreed with the merchant Amyley to give you a quite new one, scarlet good enough for the king to use to line his fur coat with
And I won't grudge you masses.
Never fear
God reward you, uncle
- Uncle?
- Yes, Zbyszko?
- I want you to make me a promise
- A promise?
When they cut my head off, take a mighty woman for yourself
What?
Are you mad?
You said it yourself.
Our line must not die out
- Look.
Do you see?
- Do you spit blood like that all the time?
A splinter two inches long is sticking between my ribs
I am going to die before winter comes
- Only you yourself can save your life
- What?
Have you heard about Duke Witold?
How he was imprisoned in Krewa and escaped disguised in women's clothes?
Now, take my leather jacket, take my hood and go, understand?
Here you have the ransom the Teutons paid for this de Lorche from Lorraine...
Then they'll cut off your head instead of mine
Good for them.
I'll die anyway in two or three weeks' time
- Take it
- I won't do that
I wish you had never been born
Listen it was not a shame for Duke Witold to escape in that way it will not be a shame for you
Duke Witold is a grand duke
He has received a crown from the king's hands, he has wealth and lordship
And I, poor nobleman, have nothing but my honour
Don't you understand that I love you and won't give your head for mine?
May the cross-wolves perish if children are to be executed through them
Shame, shame...
Stop!
Stop!
He doesn't belong to the headman.
He's mine, he's mine
She threw her veil over him.
It's an old custom.
He is hers
Let's go to the castle.
To the Castellan
Pagan country, pagan customs
It is true.
Such ancient customs exist
But it is more suited to the robbers of the Carpathian foothills and to the simple folk
Ask Father Stanislaw, he knows everything about laws and customs
One should have asked the Grand Master
It was his envoy who was insulted
The ancient, folk customs became law
Gracious Duchess.
The betrothal must take place at once if I am to honour this custom
Gracious Duke, we offer these humble gifts to you, the truly Christian lord and our Order's friend
Don't bear a grudge because of the petty conflicts and quarrels and the inconsiderate and passionate deeds committed by youngsters
You may assure the Grand Master we are his true friends and defenders of our common faith
The pious Grand Commander Zygfryd de Lowe of Szczytno wants to lodge a complaint to be considered by your Serene Highness not because of "youngsters"
Jurand of Spychow, your Serene Highness, attacked our people
He slaughtered and wounded many.
He took brother de Bergow captive
We have here the noble witness, Lord Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine who is the Order's guest
He has also been cruelly injured by Jurand...
Who is this most beautiful maiden in the world?
Fascinating indeed
She is the daughter of Jurand, the man who aimed to kill you
Hot paternal blood
Against a girl like that I'll fight most gladly
Border disputes... the pious knight de Love accuses the Count of Spychow while the noble Jurand accuses the Grand Commander of Szczytno
It is not only this complaint we ask you to consider, your Serene Highness
The Grand Master would like to get acquainted with your opinion concerning the alliance of King Jagiello with the heathens
And with the schismatics from Ruthenia as well
The Grand Master sends you this holy relic the same the gracious Duchess asked for the forefinger of St. Onufry who died a glorious death, killed by the pagans
I told you to go with this mission to Cracow and to negotiate there
- The Duke of Mazovia is benevolent
- But he will not give us Jurand
- Jurand will beg at our gates, my father
- What have you said, my son?
I said, my father, Jurand will come to us on his knees to get his daughter back
- I do not understand
- Do you want to kidnap his daughter?
She is the daughter of the most rancorous enemy of the Order
You barely escaped him with your own life
It does not agree with the knightly gospel and honour
We are destined to live on the borders, in forests
Doomed is the one who is not able to repay a blow with a blow
Listen.
She is still a child.
Don't force me to warn them
- You will not do it, sir
- I will, so help me God...
You won't...
Give him the last blow...
It is not necessary after I worked upon him
Proceed, sir, I will join you
Forgive him, Lord Jesus, his sins and grant him everlasting rest
Why, oh Lord, to spread Thy rule to defend Thy home, we have to make so much injustice
You will certainly not bring me alive to Bogda...
- Water...
- Stampeding horses!
To the woods!
To the woods!
You intruded unnecessarily, I would have managed
- Hlawa.
Take the horse
- Zych
Zych...
At last...
Good gracious
Thus, you returned to your Bogdaniec
- I did, didn't I, just to die here
- What is wrong?
Jagna, it's our neighbour Macko of Bogdaniec
Come here
- Who is that?
- Did you not recognise Zbyszko?
Zbyszko?
Jagna, come here
Quickly.
Give him a kiss, for old times' sake
Am I already at death's door, Father?
I tried to pull out the splinter, but I failed
- He failed.
Zych?
- Yes, brother?
Do you have much land of your own?
Thanks to good husbandry three malets and about 50 men
And Jagna?
Jagna, how old is she?
She is now so attracted to boys that when she sees them she rubs one knee against the other
Zych, you lied, you have 70 men
- What is that to you?
- If Zbyszko takes your Jagna...
Well, well.
Let me hear your confession, it may be too late later
Tell me the truth, as in the face of God.
How many men have you?
- Will he live, sir?
- God willing
But the priest advised to try to heal him with bear's fat
Hlawa.
Have you brought bear's fat?
- No, my lady.
The dogs ate it all up
- I will look for some in the tree-hives
I've been told I could easily find one there
It's dangerous.
Take our Hlawa with you
To frighten the bear away?
No
God have mercy...
Use your axe
- Who are you?
- Jagienka
I don't know what would have happened if it was not for you
Leave me alone.
Will you?
A lad of ours also went with a fork and an axe and the bear tore him to pieces
Thus, I went after you
- Then it was you there under the pines?
- Yes
There cannot be another girl like you in the world
- You ought to go to the war
- Don't laugh at me
Wait.
We'd better get a beaver at once because when the wound opens you have to stop it with beaver's fat and the sickness will leave him
- Where are the beaver's lodges?
- Come
Did you heard me sing, when you laid in wait for the bear?
- It was you?
- Yes
These woods belong to Cztan of Rogow
- The man who would like to marry you?
- If only I would let him!
I've been told that Cztan grinds his teeth at Wolf your other neighbour who would like to marry you too
Oh, yes
- Foolish lads
- Why?
When your father was away one of them should have taken you from Zgorzelice
What if your father had come back and found you with a child?
Let them try.
You think I don't know how to grasp a spear or a crossbow?
I would have driven each of them home again and raided their villages
If I were Cztan or Wolf, I would not be afraid of your father or you
- But I would have taken you
- You would have?
Why should a girl fight with lads when she ought to marry
Don't be stupid.
Be quiet
There are the beavers, in the warm spring
- I've got it, I've got it
- I am going for it
Don't.
The mud is deep.
Anyone unfamiliar with it will certainly drown
- Then how will you get it?
- Don't worry about it.
Let's go
I've left my arrows in the willow.
Wait
- Hey, what a cunning girl you are
- Oh, go away
Squeeze out the water from my plait
- And I was waiting for you like a fool
- Was I to undress in front of you?
- That would be something to marvel at
- Be quiet.
Take the beaver
Give it
- Zbyszko
- Yes?
I will marry neither Cztan nor Wolf
God will give you the best man possible.
You will be worthy of him
In a couple of weeks, Macko will be able to mount a horse
I am waiting for that as for salvation.
It is hard for me to stay here
- Why?
- Were you told about Danusia?
I heard something.
I know she covered you with a veil
I know every knight vows some deed, even the married ones
- But this Danusia, who is she?
- I will tell you, as I would my own sister
For her sake I would cross the ninth river and the ninth sea
I will fulfil what I have vowed to her, unless I die first
- Is it true?
- It is
I did not realise that.
Hlawa...
May God reward you for everything, my girl
Hlawa will help you to get the beavers.
I am going back home
What the deuce!
Who has killed him?
Wait...
He is still breathing.
- It's not worth it.
He'll die in no time
- Let's help him
Leave him.
If he recovers, it will bring us trouble
And so his purse and sword...
He'll reward us happily with the purse when he recovers, and besides we gain merit in heaven for rescuing a Christian.
Let's take him
You fool.
It's a mere loss of time
Go on.
Take him
Perhaps he'll survive
An urgent message for the gracious Duchess from the Count of Spychow
Perhaps he announces he'll come for Christmas
Nothing but bad news.
A part of the fortalice had been burned in Spychow
Jesus
Father Kaleb writes, the Count of Spychow may recover but the sparks and coals so burned his only eye that little light was left in it and he is threatened with blindness
That is why the Count of Spychow...
summons Danusia to come to him for he wants to see her again before darkness overwhelms him
He also humbly thanks the Duchess for raising the girl like a daughter and he promises that he would come to Ciechanow for Christmas to fall at the lady's feet and beg her favour and support for Danusia for the future
Come nearer
I do not know you.
Why hasn't Tolima come?
He was injured in a recent fight with the Germans
The Count begs for the swift return of his daughter since he may be blind soon
Gracious lady, we have to go back as soon as the horses have rested
We shall meet your neighbours, Cztan and Wolf, at Krzesnia
- Show them to me from a distance
- I will, Zbyszko
They will meet you in front of the church.
What will they do?
Attend me as best they know
They will not attend to you today, understand?
That's them
- What now?
- Well, what?
- Shall we at once...
- How can you fall on him in church?
Not in church but after Mass
That's her father.
Do you remember what he said?
If we started a fight he would banish us from Zgorzelice
If it were not for that, I would have broken your ribs long ago
Or I yours
Let's better break his together
- Let's do it
- After Mass
Hurry up
- Woe is me
- To the inn
I have to pay for the mass for my uncle's health.
I'll go back
- We'll send money from Zgorzelice
- I have to go back
Go.
God be with you
If either of you two denies that the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the world is Danusia Jurand of Spychow's daughter I will challenge him to fight on horseback or on foot, until death
What?
You dog's brother.
Jagienka is not the most beautiful
He is mocking
That's what you knights are like?
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
Where is Zbyszko?
He went back to the church.
He forgot to pay for the Mass
Daddy.
Perhaps we will send a couple of lads to Krzesnia?
- What for?
- The quarrel has broken out there
What quarrel?
Whom is he to fight with?
Cztan and Wolf, he'll fight for me
If so, let them fight
- You've done it quickly, how was it?
- I just paid for the Mass
- Haven't you been in the inn?
- I have
- Well, and what happened?
- Nothing
Now my uncle feels better, I shall go to Mazovia
- To Danusia?
- I have vowed
You vowed to get a peacock's crest
I vowed to take her for my wife.
God grant you health and all the best
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
- I am your servant, my Lord
- My servant?
Lady Jagienka of Zgorzelice gave me to you
- Go back home.
I don't want you
- I will not go back, sir
I am a prisoner of war from Boleslawice.
I was given to you
- Thus, you are mine?
- Yours, my Lord
Then, I order you to go back
Lady Jagienka sent you this too
Go away.
Do you want me to break your bones?
- What is your name?
- In Czech, Hlawa.
In Polish, Big Head
Give me the cape
Christians, save a servant of God
Whoever you are, sir, help a servant of God
Who are you?
Sanderus.
My horse ran away, I was left alone without weapons
A wild beast may appear any moment in the forest
I shall perish if you do not save me
Give him a horse
May God multiply your victories, valiant knight
Hey, innkeeper.
We want to wait until the snowstorm is over
Welcome travellers from far away
Get out of here
I am dead-cold.
Order a flask of wine for me
For two or three gulps, I shall excuse you a month in purgatory
He looks like a drunkard
Beware of everlasting damnation.
You are speaking to a man who ate hard-boiled eggs with the Holy Father last Easter
How can you write me off a month of purgatory if you are not ordained?
I have obtained permission to sell pardons and relics
- Where are you from?
- Under the Prussian lords, from Malbork
You speak our language well What do they call you?
I am a German and my name is Sanderus
I was born at Torun, where all folk speak like that
Even the brothers of the Order understand your language
Innkeeper.
Bring warm beer
- Is it long since you left Malbork?
- Long enough
I have been in the Holy Land then I returned to Malbork and now I carry the holy relics and pardons which pious Christians buy for their soul's salvation
Where have you got those holy wares from?
I have plenary pardons, pardons for 500 years, for 300 and cheaper ones, so that even poor people can buy them and thus shorten the pains of purgatory for themselves...
I have pardons for past sins and for the future ones but I don't keep the money I get for them
A piece of black bread and a drink of water is enough for me
The remainder of what I get I take to Rome to help them to collect in time for a new crusade
And these relics?
Are they important ones?
Such that it is not fitting even to talk of them without taking your hat off
I have a shoe of the ass ridden on by the Holy Family on their flight into Egypt
I have a feather from archangel Gabriel's wing which he lost during the Annunciation
I have some of the oil in which the pagans boiled St. John
I have a rung of the ladder Jacob saw in his dreams and a phial containing wind, which was blowing in the Bethlehem stable
Is the storm over?
Why, no, I suppose we will have to spend Christmas Eve here
Saddle the horses.
Let's go
It's very dangerous now, my Lord, the roads are buried in snow
I have to reach the Duke of Mazovia before Christmas Eve
They will wait, my Lord, and here we may lose our way and perish
You can stay here, you drunkard
I can't.
Who will defend my holy goods?
Don't go, my Lord
- We rode off the highway
- I warned you
- Let's go
- The horses will not go on
Everything is going wrong, my Lord.
One can't see the highway any more
There is a man under the snow
It will snow us over too, my Lord
It will snow us over too, it will snow us over
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
It will snow us over!
Some men...
light...
There are some men there
- Hey!
- You there!
Hey!
Hey!
Is anybody there?
Who are you?
The Duke of Mazovia's men.
We have been sent to help travellers
Follow me, there are some people buried there
It is Jurand
Give me a torch
Rub him with snow
Gracious Lord.
Jurand of Spychow has been found under the snow
You found him?
Bring him here
Danusia?
We tried to find her.
Have you left her back at Spychow?
I was going to her, to Ciechanow...
Why, you have sent men with a letter for her.
Wake up!
By God's mercy, where is my child?
Listen.
There came an armed troop with a letter from you saying that you were injured during a fire
Woe to me.
They have seized my child and they will destroy her
Who?
The Teutonic Knights... de Lowe Godfryd...
Rotgier...
- Was it you who dug me out?
- With the others
- Are you going to help me now?
- Your daughter saved me from death
- Do you love her?
- I belong to her forever...
Even if I have to bite Prussian castles with my teeth, I'll get her
Do you know what the vengeance of the brothers of the Order is?
And now to Spychow
My Lord.
Some monks are waiting for you here
They were bustling about Spychow.
They want to speak with you
- Who are you?
- Pilgrims
- Where from?
- From Szczytno
Where is my child?
He who sent us ordered us not to speak with you in the presence of witnesses
I have no secrets before these men
But we have.
If you bid them to stay we will have to depart
Since it has to be so, you remain alone
Your daughter was kidnapped by robbers
With crosses on their cloaks?
No.
But God blessed the brethren, they rescued her and now she is with them
Where?
Under the protection of the pious brother Szomberg
Szomberg.
The one who strangled Witold's children
He takes good care of her and she will not be harmed
What have I to do to get her back?
- Humble yourself before the Order
- Silence!
- Have you a letter?
- No
We say what we have to say
Nothing evil will happen to your daughter.
The brethren will repay you good for evil if you satisfy their just demands
- What do they want?
- Brother de Bergow released
I will release him
And all the other prisoners you still have at Spychow
I will not bargain for my child
But that is not all
To protect the good name of the Order, the brethren add another condition
You will declare to the Duke and to the whole knighthood that it was robbers who kidnapped your daughter and that you had to pay a ransom to get her back
It is true that robbers kidnapped my child and that I must pay a ransom to them to get her back
You will say that you took a ransom from de Bergow to pay the robbers
I have never taken a ransom
For it was never a question of your child
Or do something else
You may come to Szczytno yourself for your daughter
I?
To Szczytno?
For robbers may again kidnap her on the way and the suspicion will fall on the pious brethren
Who will guarantee my return from Szczytno?
The virtue of the brethren, their justice and piety
I will come to Szczytno.
But both of you will stay here until my return and then you will go with Bergow and the prisoners
You don't want to trust the monks so why should they trust you?
Whoever you are, do not test my patience
Say what you were ordered to say
The brethren told us you have to go to Szczytno without saying a word
Did they not tell you I would break you with a wheel in Spychow?
Your daughter is in the hands of the brethren
What did they want?
Tell us
Are you sick, my Lord?
What news of Danusia?
With what proposal have they come?
With a ransom.
For de Bergow
Where is Danusia?
She is not with the Teutonic Knights
Come closer
He is destined for my daughter and thus he is to be lord here after my death
You will serve him faithfully in peace and in war
Have you heard?
Dear God.
Why are you giving me Spychow already?
I am giving you Danusia
The hour of death is unknown
Where is the master?
- What are your grace's commands?
- I ask you where the master is?
- He is gone
- Where to?
I do not know.
He went heavily armed
The highway will be on the right, beyond the woods and from the knoll you'll see the castle at once
From the knoll, you say?
The castle?
You are not a German, sir, are you?
They did not pay their taxes
The brethren need a lot of money for the war with Samogitis
After the war against the Samogitians is over, they will start another one
Fishing is forbidden hunting too...
The tax on milling is very high and if they find a quern in a hut, they don't even spare children or women
- Now you will find the way yourself
- I will
- God reward you, worshipful master
- God be with you
- Who is there?
- Jurand of Spychow
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander Zygfryd de Lowe bids me to say to you that as long as you do not dismount the gates will not be opened
And your weapons are to be given up
Now, by Order of the Commander you have to put on this horse sack to hang the scabbard of your sword from your neck by a rope... and to wait in humility at the gate until the Commander orders it to be opened
My child
On your feet, dog.
The Commander orders you to appear before him
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander bade me to bring you in.
Follow me
- Have you no weapons on you?
- I gave them all up
Beware of bursting into anger.
You are under the force of the Commander
See how the power of the Order conquers malice and pride
- God grants it may always do so
- You bit the Order like a dog
God has caused you to stand before us like a dog with a rope round your neck
Do not compare me with a dog, for you deprive of honour those who have fought with me and perished by my hand
You still spit in pride
I am deprived of pride
By shaming my knighthood, you have shamed yourself
Do not complain that you have been shamed
Though you have been made a kennel man it is better to be the Order's kennel man than one of your knights
By the Passion of the Redeemer and everlasting Salvation, give me back my child as you promised
- Who promised you?
- You did
Commander
The word of a Knight of the Order is to be esteemed as the word of God
How so?
Will you not only let the girl go but also this mad dog to bite us anew?
I trusted Godfryd with this matter.
Be calm, my son
Well, you wolf.
You lapped our blood and now we pay you good for evil
I was hard on you but I was never treacherous
Here you have your child
This is not my daughter.
It is not her
It is not your daughter?
By St. Liborius of Paderborn it means it wasn't your child we rescued from the robbers for there is no other in Szczytno
There is.
I heard her sing
We are all witnesses that we are giving back the girl the robbers thought was Jurand of Spychow's daughter.
If that is not your daughter it is no fault of ours but the will of our Lord
God looks upon your treachery
By the wound of the Redeemer, by the hour of our death, ...give me back my child
If we give her back to you it will be with a bastard of mine
Spare him!
- On what are we taking counsel?
- On our defeat
On what the Grand Master and the Chapter will say and on the means of preventing our actions from harming our Order
- It still smells of blood here
- I ordered the floor to be washed
Where is brother Godfryd's body?
In the chapel.
The brethren are chanting litanies
- Where are the other corpses?
- In the snow to get them stiffened
- Is Jurand alive?
- He is alive
The soldiers wanted to finish him off but the Chaplain did not let them
It was a fatal idea to kidnap Jurand's daughter
Nobody will accuse us if the girl disappears
Pure reason speaks through brother Rotgier's mouth
Then even the Pope or the Roman emperor can take us to court
- What shall we do with the girl?
- Give her to me
No, my son.
When the Order is in question, renounce pleasure
Harden your hearts
Godfryd was reached by the hand of God for he desired not only to avenge the wrongs of the Order but also to satisfy his own lust
The time is near when the Order will be put to severe test
That is an evil night
You, brother de Bergow, will go to the Grand Master of Malbork
You have groaned in captivity with Jurand so they will more readily believe you
Say that before we entangled this madman in a net he managed to kill nine men and among them brother Godfryd
- God grant him everlasting rest
- Amen
And tell him that although we wanted to subdue an enemy of the Order yet none here was the first to draw sword against Jurand
I shall tell everything my eyes have seen
Are you quite certain Rotgier that nobody will learn the truth about Jurand's daughter?
Besides Godfryd, the both of us and the woman servant who watches her nobody knows we have her here
Godfryd ordered the men who brought her here to be hanged
Good
What will you do with Jurand's daughter?
I shall do whatever the good of the Order may require
Have you courage in your heart, my son?
Can you doubt it?
I do not doubt it
For your valiancy, I love you more than anyone in the world
Go then to Duke of Mazovia's court and tell him what happened here as we agreed between us
That's dangerous
It's for the good of the Order
But what if Jurand survives and regains his freedom?
Even though he regains his freedom he will never utter a word of complaint against the Order
Mindful of the Divine command we did not want to slay him although he slew many of our men, first of all brother Godfryd
At last we had to entangle him in a net then he raised the weapon and injured himself terribly
That night people in Szczytno heard laughter and voices calling in the air the enemy of the Cross, the shedder of innocent blood, our Jurand
You say you summoned Jurand to Szczytno?
Yes, gracious lady, when we rescued the crippled girl from the robbers we thought it was Jurand's daughter
How could you think that when you had seen Jurand's real daughter with me in Cracow?
We monks do not raise our eyes to women
Also, there were many maids with the gracious Duchess in Cracow
How did you know about the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
The audacity and godlessness of this deed made it known also among us
It is strange you would take the idiot-girl for Jurand's daughter
Perhaps Satan changed her
But robbers could not imitate Jurand's seal or the writing of his priest.
Who could do that?
An evil spirit.
These questions are like swords in my breast for suspicion is concealed behind them
I ask you, did Jurand himself accuse us of this deed?
His letter is available
That is true, there is Jurand's letter concerning robbers
See how the light of truth vanquishes darkness
Reward our losses and our blood, my Lord.
He was your subject
What do you want?
Jurand attacked you in madness.
Have I to be responsible for it?
My Lord, his land and fort in which he imprisoned servants of the Order, lie in your duchy
Let at least that become, henceforth, the Order's property
That payment will not bring our dead brothers to life but perhaps it will appease the divine anger and wipe out the disgrace
Haven't you got enough?
All these countries Eastern Pommerania, Prussia, the Chelmno county which belonged to us and are yours today
Jurand's daughter is still alive
For no-one has told us of her death and you want to rob her dowry
Jurand shed the blood of the brethren of the Order
You admitted the wrong, my Lord
So recompense us as your ducal conscience and your spirit of justice bids you
I come here as the Knight of the Most Holy Virgin ready to defend the honour of the Order with my own blood
If there is anyone, despite what Jurand said who dares to suspect the Order of kidnapping his daughter let him take up this knightly gage and venture on the wager of God's judgement
Is there anyone who will pick up that glove?
I will
Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
I take God as my witness, you, my distinguished Lord and the whole knighthood of this land that I am innocent of this blood that will be shed
They were men in combat according to law and custom in a knightly and proper manner
- Is he back?
- Not yet
But don't trouble yourself, commander for it is a judgement of God
- Judgement of God?
- Brother Rotgier is a famous knight
- But he should already be here
- He will return covered in new glory
Go and see who that is
Take the body to the chapel
Thus, they have sent him back
Is brother Rotgier already in the chapel?
Yes
Tell Diederich to come here with the keys and the lantern...
My coat
Let him also bring a brazier with charcoal
Dear son...
And you wrote to me that he was almost a child...
The whole arm
Many times you raised it for the Order's glory and now a Polish axe has hewn it off
The Lord did not bless you
Perhaps he does not care anymore for our Order
He has abandoned me also, although I have served Him my whole life
No, no, this is not possible, for we are in the right
Ours is the just cause
I do love you my son, and you will never speak again
Wait.
I will make you happy
Ready?
Once you told what brother Godfryd had ordered you to do and you lost your tongue
So, I tell you, that if with a single movement you show what you have done by my order, I will have you hanged
Do you understand?
Go on
On your knees, you dog
Get out
Light
You were promised that you would go free but the tongue with which you blasphemed will be torn out
Brother Rotgier is waiting.
I promised him to lay your right hand in his coffin
You still have one eye left
I only had you and now I have no-one
Listen, dear son, I vow to you I will lay the hand which slew you on your grave or perish myself
But before I get him I will make him suffer worse
He will not see that girl again
Who is there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Once I knelt under the headman's axe for I raised my sword against the Knights of the Order
Let the headsman cut off my head because I am going to raise it again
The Knights of the Order kidnapped Danusia
They drew Jurand into a trap
I will go alone and perish under their walls
Let the world know about the wrongs done by them
Order my head cut off but defend them, intercede for them with the Grand Master
Stop it.
Have you proved Jurand and his daughter were lured into a trap?
- Who else could have done it, my lord?
- Have you any witnesses?
Gracious lord, I have been informed that in the woods in Carpathia in a hut belonging to simple charcoal-burners Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine was lying wounded
I sincerely apologise, worshipful king, I am not able to make due homage
They stabbed me in my back and the wound has not healed
What has this to do with kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
I testify, gracious lord, that the monks from Szczytno discussed the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter
They stabbed me on the road like a wild boar because I wanted to prevent that mean trick
Will you repeat it in the presence of the Grand Master?
I witnessed here in Cracow against Jurand and now when the justice demands it I will witness against the monks from Szczytno...
Gracious lord...
Sir, accept my homage and my deep gratitude
Are you Zbyszko of Bogdaniec?
The most humble homage to the knight of the most beautiful girl in the world
If you deny it I will have to challenge you to combat on foot or on horse
Duchess Anna Danuta
Who is she, that most beautiful lady in the world?
Jagienka.
I can hardly believe my own eyes you look so beautiful.
How come you are in court?
My father has died.
The duchess agreed most kindly to protect me but I am always longing for Zgorzelice
Uncle, you are also here?
I have always told you, young boar, that she is like a deer, haven't I?
Noble Lord, the king asks you to come
Excuse me, sir
I have one more piece of bad news for you, my Lords
The Knights of the Teutonic Order robbed the ships loaded with grain which we sent to Lithuania
They spread rumours we supplied the Samogitians with arms
What does Jungingen want?
To sell our grain to the Lithuanians or start the war?
Is war inevitable?
Can we let them conquer Samogitia, Lithuania?
Will they stop after that?
The Order is an unconquered power
True, we will perish if we allow them to surprise us in a single battle
In alliance with Lithuania, Ruthenia and other peoples, we will win
Gracious Lord have I to speak truly or beautifully?
Do tell the truth, Castellan
Do you bid us, my king, to enter into an alliance with pagans and eastern schismatics against the Order?
Such plans do not correspond with a Christian leader
To weaken the Order means to weaken Christianity
You were to tell the truth, Castellan.
Do I want war?
Who blocks the way to overseas countries for our grain?
Who annexed Eastern Pommeranie?
If war breaks out, it will be a most cruel one and that is why we already think about the necessary preparations
But first we shall try to mitigate the matter
Castellans, Gracious Lords we shall summon the Order to give us back the ships with grain
Our envoys shall go to Malbork
How you have changed...
Sieur de Lorche would like to ask you, sir, whether that young lady is a mortal being or is she perhaps and angel?
Tell Sieur de Lorche it is an angel who chose a devilishly beautiful bodily cover for the time it stay among the mortals
Please, don't Zbyszko
What about Danusia?
Are there any news?
I do not know...
We are going to Malbork
The Gracious Lord agreed that you join us
Thank you, sir
- Uncle
- Yes...
- Jurand burdened me with Spychow
- Yes
In case I did not come back from Malbork please go to Spychow and defend the castle...
And who will dwell in Bogdaniec?
Just look at him.
He has a girl, who would crush all the nuts spread on the bench if she sat on them!
And he goes away into the world!
I beg you to do me this favour
If I am not back soon, go to Spychow
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Welcome Polish Knights
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
Brother, lead the noble Polish lords and conceal nothing
Are these prisoners of war?
These are wretched rebels, heretics and pagans
They work here for the glory of God
The envoys of the Polish King to the Grand Master
My heart is full of joy, Gracious Lords that we sit together at one table, as it is fitting for good Christians...
Let us not allow the Samogitians to incite war between the Order and your king...
There is proof of all sorts of cruel outrages done by the brethren of the Order in Samogitia
I have already said in Cracow, the imperial privileges are not outrages
The charter says The Order of the Blessed Virgin is granted Lithuania, Prussia, Ruthenia and, in general all lands of the schismatics, which it can reach with its flags
That emperor was very generous indeed where the property of others was involved
May God forgive you this mockery
The emperor on earth is God's deputy where secular power is involved
His concern is to widen the areas of Christianity
We pray for the soul and eternal peace for your queen Jadwiga.
As long as she was alive there was harmony between us
The laws of the Holy Father were recognised and those of the emperors and their faithful servant, the Order, as well
Let us pray for peace for those living on earth
We are aware you prepare yourselves for war against the Order
We know your king ordered big hunting to take place further, that salted meat in barrels be prepared for the army
We ask you frankly, which side will you take when we proceed to Lithuania to defend our affairs to punish Samogitia for the godless rebellions
It is the Order that is a menace to Samogitia and Lithuania
Will you enter into an alliance with pagans?
Pax, pax among Christians
You are our guests
We have good will to listen to your complaints and to consider them
And it is our desire to entertain you with due respect
We want to entertain you as neighbours and friends
We have two infallible means to meet our enemies with a tower full of gold upstairs and iron which is forged downstairs
Just look...
The iron is excellent indeed...
But you do a lot of harm with this iron
- The Order is pious and just
- You said just, right?
And what fate met Jurand's daughter and that young knight?
What about the outrage done to Sieur de Lorche?
Does the Order have means to prevent it?
Sir, proceed to the Grand Master and lodge your complaint
And you also, sir
Welcome, Sieur de Lorche
How is that possible that we see you alive?
We have been told by the Commander of Szczytno that you have been attacked on the way to Cracow and killed
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd attacked me because I wanted to warn the Duke of Mazovia and this knight of Bogdaniec that they were going to kidnap the daughter of Jurand of Spychow
Brothers Rotgier and Godfryd are dead
If they have done this crime against a guest of the Order Heaven has punished them justly
But neither the maid nor her father have been found
Jurand shed the knights' blood in Szczytno
He must suffer the punishment he deserves
Defenceless, he rushed upon people who kidnapped his daughter just as they once killed his wife
Your people deprived him of everything dearest to him
Various and wrong things happen on the borders
There is plenty of wickedness on both sides
I cannot believe that brothers from Szczytno acted in a way that did not conform to the vocation of monks and with the honour of German knights
This matter has to be thoroughly investigated
What about the annexation of ships for Lithuania.
You can't believe it either?
These vessels shipped arms for Witold.
Weapons against the Order
- There were no arms there
- There were.
You can see it
One weapon is like another
You say the Order is lying?
And do you believe your own words?
We shall return to this problem tomorrow
Concerning this girl, I shall give you a safe conduct letter to Szczytno and a monastery clerk, to accompany you
Thank you, sir
- What is the matter with you, sir?
- I can't breathe
I'm suffocating.
Take me out of here
Have you heard the complaint of this young knight and Sieur de Lorche's testimony?
Why do those who are posted on the border commanderies bring only shame upon the Order?
Jagiello requests the return of the ships and the exchange of prisoners
Jagiello enters into an alliance with the pagans
Whoever raises to destroy the Poles, deserves salvation
Christ, our Lord converted with words and not with swords
I warn you, brethren, the Order proceeds in an unjust manner far too often
There are rumours that the Prussians are rebelling
German towns are rising against us
Are we to wait till paganism and heresy absorb Christianity?
Idleness means perdition
Sometimes I think that war means perdition
Because you are ill and weak, Gracious Brother
We shall summon the most distinguished knights from all over Europe
We shall make known that those who will destroy the Poles and their king will deserve eternal life
What do you want?
In God's name, war!
- War!
- War!
War!
I tell you once more in the last hour of my life if the good of the Order is the concern of yours, be patient
Do not make war now
Poland, Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia will overthrow us
Give them back the ships...
What does that mean?
Sanderus
What are you doing here?
Be quiet, Gracious Lord.
The brethren should not learn we know each other
I've been to Szczytno.
Your damsel is there
How do you know?
From the chaplain, who is an honest man
She is watched now by Commander Zygfryd de Love
He did her no harm, for once.
When he wanted to do her wrong something pushed him down the staircase, he fainted and almost died
And now he is afraid of her
Do you hear, my Lord, the Grand Master died
What did you say?
The Grand Master died?
Yes, sir.
People say that now they will elect Ulrich the late Master's brother, God grant him everlasting rest
Thus, war is inevitable
I wish you, my Lord, that you may rule with justice, reason and in peace
We are here not for peace's sake but to fight for the faith against pagans and heathens
You have none to fight with, Gracious Lord for you are surrounded by Christian peoples only
True Christians do not support the faithless
What answer have we to take back to our king?
Will the ships with grain be given back to us?
Ships with weapons will become our legal booty
May I remind you, Gracious Lord about the promise made by your late brother and ask you for the safe-conduct letter to Szczytno?
The crew of Szczytno, with de Love set out to fight the rebellious Samogitia
You will find nobody there.
Wait until quieter times
Are you leaving, sir?
Perhaps it is better this way, for I can smell war here
That's true.
Zygfryd de Love and his crew set out for Samogitia
- I will search for him there
- You, for him, and I, for your damsel
He certainly hid her somewhere, to leave no trace
Give me, sir, one purse more and I will proceed from castle to castle and although this is dangerous, maybe I will learn something
Take it and go
It is time for us to bid farewell, sir
I wish you success in your noble search
If you have no objections, sir I would like to announce that Jagienka of Zgorzelice is the fairest and most virtuous lady in the world
Announce it wherever you wish, my Lord.
Perhaps it is even true
Jagienka
Back from Cracow already?
Have you heard something about Zbyszko?
I feel so restless.
The king's deputies came back without him from Malbork
- We were among the Teutonic Knights
- To look for something he'll never find
I have hardly begun to administer here and now I have to go
Among these scoundrels, the fate of Jurand or Danusia may befall him
- Take me with you.
I will help you
- You will help me indeed
You think when you cast off your skirt you will grow wiser
Wisdom is in the head.
Do you want Cztan or Wolf to take me?
They will not take you.
I made them both swear it Cztan, that he will defend you against Wolf and Wolf, that he will not give you to Cztan
Lord Jesus did not spare your cunningness
Everything will always be as you wish
If it were so, you would have long since been mistress of Bogdaniec
Why do you kiss me?
I am only saying goodnight.
We must start at dawn tomorrow
- Are you not afraid to go there?
- I am not.
I want to be near Zbyszko
If Danusia is lost, Zbyszko will be so grieved that he will not look at you
I do not want him to look at me.
I only want to be near him
Look at this giant
- That is no knight for he is going on foot
- He must be blind
He does not even have a dog.
We cannot leave him without help
Do you understand Christian language, old man?
- Get up
- What is the matter with you?
Can you speak?
He is trying to show that they have torn his tongue out
Who did that to you?
The Knights of the Teutonic Order
Are you from here?
From Mazovia?
What were you doing among the Teutonic Knights?
Do you come from Szczytno?
Were you not seeking your child there?
Then, you are Jurand of Spychow
The lord?
Teutonic Knights?
Let's go against the dog's brothers!
Will you fight against the peasants?
They are not the guilty ones
The Knights sit in their fortalices now
We will catch the Germans and throw them at our lord's feet
I am the uncle of Zbyszko of Bogdaniec and until he returns I give the orders here
- The lord went away two days ago
- Where to?
To the Samogitian frontier to search for the young lady
- The war is raging there.
- Then we missed one another
Hlawa?
Where is the lord?
- He keeps on discussing...
- Good...
Uncle.
What are you doing here?
I have been looking for you all over the world and at last I've found you
You thought I will sit in Bogdaniec till the end of my days
Jurand is in Spychow
The Teutonic Knights blinded him, tore out his tongue and cut off his right hand
Dreadful
And you?
Did you accomplish anything?
Have you found Danusia?
- No
- No?
This is my uncle, a knight from Bogdaniec
He has no equal on the battlefield
- Welcome, sir, be seated...
- Welcome
We want to attack the Germans
Two days ago we were near the castle at Nowe Kowno and they defeated us
- Defeated?
- Defeated...
We consider if it would be better to wait near Nowe Kowno, or go to Regneta
- Where is Nowe Kowno?
- About two miles from here
- And Regneta?
- Far northwards
It is good that it is far.
The Germans are not expecting us there
He is right
Exactly.
In the vicinity of Nowe Kowno they already defeated us
Because of that, they do not expect any attack
But Regneta is certainly less well-guarded
- He is right
- Where shall we make the ambush?
Here, near Nowe Kowno
You shall take position in the thickets above the highway and wait for the reinforcements on their way to the castle
200 people will not take part in the battle.
They will retreat
- I will attack from behind
- Cunning
The Teutonic Knights march and hide in a column
You can't destroy the columns with your bellies, can you?
You are wrong, uncle
It is the most courageous nation in the world
They are joyful, the accursed dogs
- At them!
- Attack!
Bind him.
Bind him
It's an important knight...
De Lorche
I recognised you
By the holy bones of St. Laurence.
I implore you, where is de Love?
- He escaped
- Is Jurand's daughter with him?
Jurand's daughter?
There is only an idiot-girl they had shown Jurand in Szczytno
How do you know it is an idiot-girl?
I heard her only, for she is ill and does not leave her wicker litter
Zygfryd had nothing to do with the kidnapping
- Right, yes!
- He is a faithful servant of the Order
And he was not aware of Rotgier and Godfryd's crimes
- Where have they escaped to?
- I do not know
It was agreed, in case we were attacked by somebody Zygfryd and his men will withdraw into a safe place till the battle ends
- Hear this?
- My Lord!
My Lord and defender, save me
But for you, the wolves would have devoured me or I would have fallen into the hands of those sons of Satan
My Lord, tell them to give me something to drink else you will be burdened with my innocent soul
Here, you drunkard
- Christ, our Lord, that is but mare's milk
- Then don't drink it
Thank you for taking me under your protection
You never refuse me any money or drink better than this mare's milk, which disgusts me but of which I will drink some more just to show that a pious pilgrim drinks from no mortification
Stop fooling around and tell me, do you know about Danusia?
Just a moment...
I have come to love you, Lord
When misfortune came upon you, I told myself I have to help you
Suffice to say that I found her and from that moment I have stuck to commander Zygfryd de Love as a bur sticks to a dog's tail...
- Is Danusia still alive?
- She is
He carries her in a wicker litter, fastened between two horses
That's the idiot-girl.
I told you de Love became odd after his son's death
What idiot-girl?
You told yourself, my Lord that your damsel has a lute
- Where are they?
- Certainly somewhere in the vicinity
De Love led the reinforcements which were marching towards Nowe Kowno
When he saw he fell into an ambush, he ordered a withdrawal
- Where could they find shelter?
- I do not know...
Perhaps by the potter deep in the woods, where we recently stopped
- To horses!
- Wait!
Wait!
Give me a horse I will ride ahead and will tell them I escaped from captivity
It will be safer this way.
I might be of some use to your damsel when you will attack Zygfryd de Love's men
Sir, don't believe that drunkard
Give him a horse.
He didn't betray me before, he will not betray me now
Sanderus
He purposely took their swords and cuirasses
- You take Zygfryd, he must be in the hut
- Good
- And I'll take that knight
- Yes
Hlawa...
You watch Danusia
- Forward
- Help
Bind him!
Bind him!
- What is the matter with you?
- Help me to my feet
Hold this
Danusia.
Danusia
- I am afraid
- Danusia.
It is me, Zbyszko
- I am afraid
- Danusia
It is me, Zbyszko.
Danusia
Danusia.
Danusia.
Danusia...
Let go of me.
I'll kill him like a dog
Scoundrel.
Would you stab a bound captive?
Danusia.
Do you recognise me?
Danusia
I am frightened
Listen, bitch, you'll dress the lady in clean garments and you will dress yourself in the rags which you have made her wear hitherto
Then we will choose a branch for you
- Danusia!
Defend me, help me!
- Get out!
Leave her alone!
They brought her to this state by torment
There you have the nobility of your Zygfryd
Take him and go to Spychowo.
Throw him to Jurand's legs
Let Jagienka know Danusia is ill and we have to ride slowly.
Go on
True, my Lord, your life in Poland is more difficult and complicated than I imagined living in Lorraine
Oh, yes.
You'll have to make the choice, my Lord
We can give you a guide to Cracow if you want to stay with us if not, the way to Malbork stays open
Farewell, my Lord, God willing, I will see you sometime again
Hey!
Take him
I was asked, Gracious Lord, to bring you Zygfryd de Love
Before you, my Lord, stands that hellhound, that Teutonic werewolf who tortured you and destroyed your child
Let me know what I am to do with him and how I am to punish him
To your knees, dog
What are you doing, sir?
You will not let this Beelzebub go, sir?
Do you want to give the captive his freedom?
Do you want him to go without vengeance and punishment?
For this purpose we chased him all over the world
He belongs to him.
He can do with him whatever he wants
Lord, if your will is to be fulfilled the captive must be conducted to the border
Here is our border and it is not far to yours
If the divine thunderbolt does not choke and blast you there is no danger to you from men
Go free
Stop!
- The flowers smell sweet
- Danusia
- Where am I?
- Near Spychow
Danusia, wait.
Oh merciful Jesus, wait, wait!
Danusia!
I sought her until I found her and rescued her but she preferred to go to God rather than to Spychow
So young, and death has mown her down
War!
War!
The dawn is not far off
The battle is about to begin
Repeat once more my orders!
You, Grand Duke!
The Lithuanian forces are on the right wing near Stebark
You, brother Ligngwan
The Smolensk companies are to be situated near the Polish wing the Mscislaw one in the middle of the Lithuanian forces and the Nowogrod regiment stays with me
And your men, Khan Dzelal-Eddin?
My men will go together with the Lithuanians
What about you, Jan of Lamberk?
The Czech companies will proceed with the Smolensk ones the rest of them together with Poles
And you, Lord Marshall?
According to your orders, Gracious King 60 men form your guard
The Cracow company will go in the middle of the left wing near Lodwigowe followed by companies from Sieradz and Poznan
I ordered to dig loop holes in front of our lines and to conceal them thoroughly
When the Polish heavy cavalry falls into these holes then our archers and our cannons will easily hit them for the bodies will make an excellent mark
Further, the knights' cavalry will attack from both sides
And what if the Poles will not advance first?
Jagiello is a reasonable leader
Jagiello and Witold are cunning and shrewd
But they are totally lacking the European knightly arts and customs
Their people lack the soldiers discipline they get excited easily, they will certainly first attack us
No.
The heavy armed knights will enter the battle at last
As first the Tartars and the light Lithuanian cavalry will proceed
The Lithuanians and Tartars, with their skins and wooden shields will not resist the pressure of the Teutonic Knight clad in steel armour
But the Lithuanians and Tartars will make a reconnaissance to check if no ambush was prepared.
I know this is dangerous
We conquered in all battles using our stratagem
We shall crush them at once with our heavy horses and equipment
We shall take every precaution
First the loop holes, then cannons and archers and at the end, I shall lead 16 squadrons myself
I shall fight together with you
As it is fitting for a true knight
The leader should not go into the fighting crowd because he will not be able to command
According to eastern customs, the leader commands on a hill in order to see the whole battlefield
Right you are, Grand Duke
True, in the East they use to fight like this
The sun is already up...
It's time to take our positions.
Lead out the men-at-arms
No.
They will wait in the woods.
Do not hurry
It will be easier to form the rank and bear the heavy armour in the shadow
You want us to hide in the bushes
We want to fight openly, as it befits true knights
- I will not stop my warriors
- You will wait!
Even you will not stop them, Gracious Lord.
What do you bid us to do?
You will obey my orders.
Wait!
Let Father Bartosz prepare for Mass.
Two Masses
And you will wait in the woods!
Let us greet the sun
How many of the pagans are hiding in the woods?
I suppose about one hundred thousand
Thus, it will be the biggest battle of our times
We do not know how big their forces are
But they had never before brought together such power
Perhaps about one hundred thousand
What is the name of the village in front of the camp of the Teutonic Knights?
Grunwald...
Before these barbarians form ranks, we will occupy the best positions
And there look there, brethren, the guests of the Order occupy their positions
The flower of the European knighthood
The rest is in God's hands
He will support His faithful servants
The rest is in God's hands.
He will support His faithful servants
Gracious Lord, the Germans are marching
To arms, brethren!
The task will be bloody but we will secure the rule of Christianity in the East for a millennium
The Grand Master of the Order
My Lords, let us go to Mass
Gracious Lord.
With the Knights of the Teutonic Order
The knights from Bavaria, Swabia and France
Cancel the Mass.
Give me a horse
My king, the knights from Rhineland, from Frisian England
They hide in the woods
They are better at handling spoons than swords...
You do not know them.
The Poles do not lack courage but their king is hoping to receive the offer of peace at the last minute
Shame.
The whole power of the Order is afraid of the Poles
I prefer death and so I will be quite alone
I will charge the Polish army with these swords
This is contrary to discipline
Advise me how to draw the enemy out of the woods
King.
The heralds of the Teutonic Order are riding towards our camp
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold, to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
Grand Master Ulrich bids us also to inform you that if the field of battle seems too small for you he will withdraw his armies somewhat so that you need not loiter in the thickets
We have enough swords, but we will take these as an omen of victory
Couriers...
Withdraw the heavy squadrons, they are not the first to enter.
Stop!
Stop!
It is the king's order, turn back
Stop!
You do not enter first.
Stop!
Turn back!
It is the king's order.
Turn back, turn back!
Couriers to Duke Witold, to Dzebal Eddin
Lithuania!
Calisia and Sieradz groups support the right flank!
Advance to aid Masovia!
Choragiew in peril!
We will make a circuit and charge in a flank
Zyndram, let the infantry attack
- At them!
Attack!
- At the enemy!
- Forward!
- At them!
Kuno Lichtenstein, do you recognise me?
Yes, I do
I vowed that I would find you and meet you
Stand!
- To the death, with no quarter
- Stand!
Take off the helmet
Stand your ground, you dog!
That is he, who this very morning thought himself superior to all the powers of the earth
Jagna?
Jagna!
Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen challenges Your Majesty Lord, and Duke Witold to mortal battle
And in order to rouse your courage, which seems to fail you sends you these two naked swords
THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER
- Whom are you carrying with you?
- Who are you?
Out of the way!
Lower your lance, knave
- This is Count Jurand of Spychow
- Save us, oh Lord
We are merchants from Plock.
We carried grain from the mill
They broke the Order's laws
Traffic is allowed here only upon the consent of Commander Zygfryd de Lowe
I am the master here.
Let them go
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pious Commander.
We detained the Polish carts loaded with grain
But we were attacked later on
- By whom?
- By Jurand of Spychow
Father, give us your permission
Danusia.
Danusia
Danusia!
Close the gates.
The gates
It's raining.
It's raining
Thank you, oh Lord, for saving us
Open the gates
Teutonic Knights
- Are you Jurand's woman?
- I am master of Spychow's wife
Mother.
O, my mother
Mother!
I will take vengeance over you, my wife.
I will
- You there, innkeeper
- Yes, sir?
Clear the tables and bring in the candles Duchess Anna Danuta is stopping here for a rest
Magda, Magda, clear the tables.
Out with you, beggars.
Go away!
This company is too distinguished for us
Let us go
Be seated, young boar
It is not too distinguished for us.
We are gentle-folk
Hey, Danusia rejoice our hearts with the same song you sang at Zator
- Who is that?
- A maiden from the duchess' court
I thought she was an angel.
What do they call her?
Danusia.
Her father is Jurand of Spychow.
She is an orphan
Why, Jurand is still alive
The Knights of the Teutonic Order killed her mother
Jurand was out hunting when they came to Spychow
A German with a peacock feather on his helmet tied her to his saddle
She turned pale and died on the rope
There is Danusia's knight
Thank you
Worshipful lady, I wish to make my vow to that maiden
Do you wish her to be your lady?
But who are you?
That is my nephew, worshipful lady, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
- And you, sir?
- I am Macko of Bogdaniec
We were in Lithuania, fighting under the command of your brother, Duke Witold
- Were you wounded?
- No.
But we took splendid booty
Are you not boasting by any chance?
Let us see that booty
Fighting the knights from the Frisian country we made an agreement
Whoever wins should take the wagons and cuirass of the defeated there were few suits of armour and costly garments for my nephew
Do you want him to be your knight, Danusia?
I do
I vow to tear some peacocks crests from the German helmets like those of the knight who killed your mother had, and lay them at your feet
- Foolish you are, young boar
- I have vowed
The only way to get booty is to fight under Duke Witold against the Tartars
I have to get German crests.
Where shall I find them among the Tartars?
You will find captives there
Who will cultivate the land in Bogdaniec?
- I have vowed
- Because you are stupid
Duchess Ryngalla poisoned the duke and she was absolved
- We have enough money
- I have vowed
Where will you find the German crests?
Where?
Lower your lance...
Madman.
It is Grand Master's envoy to our majesty the king
- Who are you?
- I am Powala of Taczewo, you fool
You insulted our king.
You'll pay for that with your head
I welcome thee, dear Duke and Duchess of Mazovia
I welcome thee, dear brother Lingwen, Duke of Mscislaw and Nowogrod
I welcome thee, noble envoys of the Grand Master
I welcome thee gracious fathers and all the guests at our court in Cracow the Ruthenian boyars and the Polish Knights
Try to win the king's heart.
It is up to him to pardon you or cut your head off
That wild Lithuanian drinks only mare's milk
- Don't you drink, Gracious Lord?
- No.
Springwater only
Thus, you give a good example, Gracious Lord
A still better one is given by those who act nobly
That is you, Gracious Lord
His most worshipful Majesty, the Grand Master of the Blessed Virgin order aimed to let Your Majesty know gracious King, with all due respect and esteem that not only the Lithuanians but also many Poles help the rebelling pagans in Samogitia
Our people and the people from Ruthenia...
We have privileges from the Holy Father
His Holiness Urban IV gave his consent to the Order of the Blessed Virgin to sell agricultural products, but not for profit
We vowed poverty as monks but our Order is compelled to fight with pagans
The Order builds castles, mills
Who can say there is no order and fear of God in the lands belonging to us?
Order and fear of God?
And on the border, steady confusion and fires
But in our land we hold Christian laws in esteem.
We do not insult the envoys
Whom are you referring to, noble knight?
Has somebody insulted you in Poland?
I did, Gracious Lord
If the Teutonic Knight demands punishment, let there be punishment
But Zbyszko is the last in our line.
If he is no more, we shall be no more
Allow me, sir, to give my head for his
Law crushes the guilty, but it is not a dragon which laps the blood of a man without looking whose it is
What about the Teutonic Knights' justice?
Samogitia.
Swords, robbery
- They have privileges granted
- Let's fight them!
It is the booty you are after
We will not expose Poland to a conflict with the Order of the Blessed Virgin
Thus you will cut off my nephews' head?
We will.
We shall act according to the law
Ask Lichtenstein for mercy.
Only he can withdraw his complaint
That is true.
I was wearing my suit of armour
Thus, you could have defended yourself, sir
It is a suit of armour one wears only when paying solemn visits
Piercing this metal plate with a blade would surely deprive one of his life
Was it your intention to kill Squire von Lichtenstein?
It was.
As long as he was alive I could not get the crest
But I called to him from a distance to lower his lance
If he had called that he was an envoy, I would have left him in peace
True.
Why did he not call out?
Can you swear on the Passion of our Lord that you did not see his cloak and the cross?
I cannot.
I should certainly not have attacked our knight
I knew it was a Knight of the Teutonic Order
How could there be any other Teutonic Knight in the vicinity of Cracow, except for an envoy or one of his colour?
Commander von Lichtenstein
- Pardon him
- I do pardon him
From the bottom of my heart, as a servant of Christ and a monk
- Praise be to him
- But I am here as an envoy
So he who has wronged an envoy, has insulted the Order and insulted Christ Himself
And such a wrongdoing I cannot forgive
Kneel down
God... be merciful to me
The noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec is condemned by the Castellan's sentence to be beheaded with the sword
- Danusia
- Don't be mournful.
The Castellan agreed to postpone the execution
- What good will it do?
- Isn't it hard for you?
One week sooner, one later...
- What is the weather like outside?
- The sun is shining
Almighty God!
If I could mount a horse and ride through the vast fields!
It is hard for you...
Sing me a song
If I could be saved, my maiden...
We have to go, my lady
The duchess wrote a letter to the Grand Master
The king will pardon you if the Grand Master intercedes in your favour
Macko went to Malbork with the letter.
May he only arrive in time
Stop.
It is not a Saracen.
Are you a Christian?
I am.
Honestly like a knight and you are like a robber
I am Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine and I joined the Order to fight the Saracens
I thought there are no fools in Lorraine.
Saracens here?
You stupid man.
We have been Christians for ages
What about the Mazurians?
Don't make a fool out of me
I have been shown wooden Mazurian idols in Malbork
Let me give him the last blow.
He is a Mazurian
To arms!
Jurand!
Kill them
Help me.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, please help me
- Spare him.
He's not a Teutonic Knight
- He fought against us
Who are you?
Macko of Bogdaniec.
Whom have I to thank for the rescue?
I am Jurand of Spychow
Jesus...
- Who are you?
- De Bergow.
You must know about me
The pious Commander of Szczytno will offer a ransom for me
- We are in Spychow
- You are Jurand
I don't take ransoms
No Teutonic Knight will leave this place on his own feet
Bind him in chains and put him in the dungeon
- And what about him, sir?
- I am Count de Lorche
He is not a Teutonic Knight.
He is a knight from Lorraine
They came here to fight Saracens.
You offered him to me, sir
What will you do with him?
My nephew's life is in the hands of the Grand Master
I was on my way to Malbork with a letter from the Duchess of Mazovia and he wounded me
Let him pay for it now
A splinter is sticking between your ribs.
There's not much time left for you
I cannot help it...
I must go to Cracow
Now I shall not escape death.
They'll cut off my head
Most certainly.
But don't be mournful
I will have such an oak coffin made for you that even the lords of the crown have no better
I won't even allow them to behead you on the same cloth they use for the townsfolk
I have already agreed with the merchant Amyley to give you a quite new one, scarlet good enough for the king to use to line his fur coat with
And I won't grudge you masses.
Never fear
God reward you, uncle
- Uncle?
- Yes, Zbyszko?
- I want you to make me a promise
- A promise?
When they cut my head off, take a mighty woman for yourself
What?
Are you mad?
You said it yourself.
Our line must not die out
- Look.
Do you see?
- Do you spit blood like that all the time?
A splinter two inches long is sticking between my ribs
I am going to die before winter comes
- Only you yourself can save your life
- What?
Have you heard about Duke Witold?
How he was imprisoned in Krewa and escaped disguised in women's clothes?
Now, take my leather jacket, take my hood and go, understand?
Here you have the ransom the Teutons paid for this de Lorche from Lorraine...
Then they'll cut off your head instead of mine
Good for them.
I'll die anyway in two or three weeks' time
- Take it
- I won't do that
I wish you had never been born
Listen it was not a shame for Duke Witold to escape in that way it will not be a shame for you
Duke Witold is a grand duke
He has received a crown from the king's hands, he has wealth and lordship
And I, poor nobleman, have nothing but my honour
Don't you understand that I love you and won't give your head for mine?
May the cross-wolves perish if children are to be executed through them
Shame, shame...
Stop!
Stop!
He doesn't belong to the headman.
He's mine, he's mine
She threw her veil over him.
It's an old custom.
He is hers
Let's go to the castle.
To the Castellan
Pagan country, pagan customs
It is true.
Such ancient customs exist
But it is more suited to the robbers of the Carpathian foothills and to the simple folk
Ask Father Stanislaw, he knows everything about laws and customs
One should have asked the Grand Master
It was his envoy who was insulted
The ancient, folk customs became law
Gracious Duchess.
The betrothal must take place at once if I am to honour this custom
Gracious Duke, we offer these humble gifts to you, the truly Christian lord and our Order's friend
Don't bear a grudge because of the petty conflicts and quarrels and the inconsiderate and passionate deeds committed by youngsters
You may assure the Grand Master we are his true friends and defenders of our common faith
The pious Grand Commander Zygfryd de Lowe of Szczytno wants to lodge a complaint to be considered by your Serene Highness not because of "youngsters"
Jurand of Spychow, your Serene Highness, attacked our people
He slaughtered and wounded many.
He took brother de Bergow captive
We have here the noble witness, Lord Fulko de Lorche from Lorraine who is the Order's guest
He has also been cruelly injured by Jurand...
Who is this most beautiful maiden in the world?
Fascinating indeed
She is the daughter of Jurand, the man who aimed to kill you
Hot paternal blood
Against a girl like that I'll fight most gladly
Border disputes... the pious knight de Love accuses the Count of Spychow while the noble Jurand accuses the Grand Commander of Szczytno
It is not only this complaint we ask you to consider, your Serene Highness
The Grand Master would like to get acquainted with your opinion concerning the alliance of King Jagiello with the heathens
And with the schismatics from Ruthenia as well
The Grand Master sends you this holy relic the same the gracious Duchess asked for the forefinger of St. Onufry who died a glorious death, killed by the pagans
I told you to go with this mission to Cracow and to negotiate there
- The Duke of Mazovia is benevolent
- But he will not give us Jurand
- Jurand will beg at our gates, my father
- What have you said, my son?
I said, my father, Jurand will come to us on his knees to get his daughter back
- I do not understand
- Do you want to kidnap his daughter?
She is the daughter of the most rancorous enemy of the Order
You barely escaped him with your own life
It does not agree with the knightly gospel and honour
We are destined to live on the borders, in forests
Doomed is the one who is not able to repay a blow with a blow
Listen.
She is still a child.
Don't force me to warn them
- You will not do it, sir
- I will, so help me God...
You won't...
Give him the last blow...
It is not necessary after I worked upon him
Proceed, sir, I will join you
Forgive him, Lord Jesus, his sins and grant him everlasting rest
Why, oh Lord, to spread Thy rule to defend Thy home, we have to make so much injustice
You will certainly not bring me alive to Bogda...
- Water...
- Stampeding horses!
To the woods!
To the woods!
You intruded unnecessarily, I would have managed
- Hlawa.
Take the horse
- Zych
Zych...
At last...
Good gracious
Thus, you returned to your Bogdaniec
- I did, didn't I, just to die here
- What is wrong?
Jagna, it's our neighbour Macko of Bogdaniec
Come here
- Who is that?
- Did you not recognise Zbyszko?
Zbyszko?
Jagna, come here
Quickly.
Give him a kiss, for old times' sake
Am I already at death's door, Father?
I tried to pull out the splinter, but I failed
- He failed.
Zych?
- Yes, brother?
Do you have much land of your own?
Thanks to good husbandry three malets and about 50 men
And Jagna?
Jagna, how old is she?
She is now so attracted to boys that when she sees them she rubs one knee against the other
Zych, you lied, you have 70 men
- What is that to you?
- If Zbyszko takes your Jagna...
Well, well.
Let me hear your confession, it may be too late later
Tell me the truth, as in the face of God.
How many men have you?
- Will he live, sir?
- God willing
But the priest advised to try to heal him with bear's fat
Hlawa.
Have you brought bear's fat?
- No, my lady.
The dogs ate it all up
- I will look for some in the tree-hives
I've been told I could easily find one there
It's dangerous.
Take our Hlawa with you
To frighten the bear away?
No
God have mercy...
Use your axe
- Who are you?
- Jagienka
I don't know what would have happened if it was not for you
Leave me alone.
Will you?
A lad of ours also went with a fork and an axe and the bear tore him to pieces
Thus, I went after you
- Then it was you there under the pines?
- Yes
There cannot be another girl like you in the world
- You ought to go to the war
- Don't laugh at me
Wait.
We'd better get a beaver at once because when the wound opens you have to stop it with beaver's fat and the sickness will leave him
- Where are the beaver's lodges?
- Come
Did you heard me sing, when you laid in wait for the bear?
- It was you?
- Yes
These woods belong to Cztan of Rogow
- The man who would like to marry you?
- If only I would let him!
I've been told that Cztan grinds his teeth at Wolf your other neighbour who would like to marry you too
Oh, yes
- Foolish lads
- Why?
When your father was away one of them should have taken you from Zgorzelice
What if your father had come back and found you with a child?
Let them try.
You think I don't know how to grasp a spear or a crossbow?
I would have driven each of them home again and raided their villages
If I were Cztan or Wolf, I would not be afraid of your father or you
- But I would have taken you
- You would have?
Why should a girl fight with lads when she ought to marry
Don't be stupid.
Be quiet
There are the beavers, in the warm spring
- I've got it, I've got it
- I am going for it
Don't.
The mud is deep.
Anyone unfamiliar with it will certainly drown
- Then how will you get it?
- Don't worry about it.
Let's go
I've left my arrows in the willow.
Wait
- Hey, what a cunning girl you are
- Oh, go away
Squeeze out the water from my plait
- And I was waiting for you like a fool
- Was I to undress in front of you?
- That would be something to marvel at
- Be quiet.
Take the beaver
Give it
- Zbyszko
- Yes?
I will marry neither Cztan nor Wolf
God will give you the best man possible.
You will be worthy of him
In a couple of weeks, Macko will be able to mount a horse
I am waiting for that as for salvation.
It is hard for me to stay here
- Why?
- Were you told about Danusia?
I heard something.
I know she covered you with a veil
I know every knight vows some deed, even the married ones
- But this Danusia, who is she?
- I will tell you, as I would my own sister
For her sake I would cross the ninth river and the ninth sea
I will fulfil what I have vowed to her, unless I die first
- Is it true?
- It is
I did not realise that.
Hlawa...
May God reward you for everything, my girl
Hlawa will help you to get the beavers.
I am going back home
What the deuce!
Who has killed him?
Wait...
He is still breathing.
- It's not worth it.
He'll die in no time
- Let's help him
Leave him.
If he recovers, it will bring us trouble
And so his purse and sword...
He'll reward us happily with the purse when he recovers, and besides we gain merit in heaven for rescuing a Christian.
Let's take him
You fool.
It's a mere loss of time
Go on.
Take him
Perhaps he'll survive
An urgent message for the gracious Duchess from the Count of Spychow
Perhaps he announces he'll come for Christmas
Nothing but bad news.
A part of the fortalice had been burned in Spychow
Jesus
Father Kaleb writes, the Count of Spychow may recover but the sparks and coals so burned his only eye that little light was left in it and he is threatened with blindness
That is why the Count of Spychow...
summons Danusia to come to him for he wants to see her again before darkness overwhelms him
He also humbly thanks the Duchess for raising the girl like a daughter and he promises that he would come to Ciechanow for Christmas to fall at the lady's feet and beg her favour and support for Danusia for the future
Come nearer
I do not know you.
Why hasn't Tolima come?
He was injured in a recent fight with the Germans
The Count begs for the swift return of his daughter since he may be blind soon
Gracious lady, we have to go back as soon as the horses have rested
We shall meet your neighbours, Cztan and Wolf, at Krzesnia
- Show them to me from a distance
- I will, Zbyszko
They will meet you in front of the church.
What will they do?
Attend me as best they know
They will not attend to you today, understand?
That's them
- What now?
- Well, what?
- Shall we at once...
- How can you fall on him in church?
Not in church but after Mass
That's her father.
Do you remember what he said?
If we started a fight he would banish us from Zgorzelice
If it were not for that, I would have broken your ribs long ago
Or I yours
Let's better break his together
- Let's do it
- After Mass
Hurry up
- Woe is me
- To the inn
I have to pay for the mass for my uncle's health.
I'll go back
- We'll send money from Zgorzelice
- I have to go back
Go.
God be with you
If either of you two denies that the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the world is Danusia Jurand of Spychow's daughter I will challenge him to fight on horseback or on foot, until death
What?
You dog's brother.
Jagienka is not the most beautiful
He is mocking
That's what you knights are like?
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
Where is Zbyszko?
He went back to the church.
He forgot to pay for the Mass
Daddy.
Perhaps we will send a couple of lads to Krzesnia?
- What for?
- The quarrel has broken out there
What quarrel?
Whom is he to fight with?
Cztan and Wolf, he'll fight for me
If so, let them fight
- You've done it quickly, how was it?
- I just paid for the Mass
- Haven't you been in the inn?
- I have
- Well, and what happened?
- Nothing
Now my uncle feels better, I shall go to Mazovia
- To Danusia?
- I have vowed
You vowed to get a peacock's crest
I vowed to take her for my wife.
God grant you health and all the best
- Jesus Christ be praised
- For ever and ever
- I am your servant, my Lord
- My servant?
Lady Jagienka of Zgorzelice gave me to you
- Go back home.
I don't want you
- I will not go back, sir
I am a prisoner of war from Boleslawice.
I was given to you
- Thus, you are mine?
- Yours, my Lord
Then, I order you to go back
Lady Jagienka sent you this too
Go away.
Do you want me to break your bones?
- What is your name?
- In Czech, Hlawa.
In Polish, Big Head
Give me the cape
Christians, save a servant of God
Whoever you are, sir, help a servant of God
Who are you?
Sanderus.
My horse ran away, I was left alone without weapons
A wild beast may appear any moment in the forest
I shall perish if you do not save me
Give him a horse
May God multiply your victories, valiant knight
Hey, innkeeper.
We want to wait until the snowstorm is over
Welcome travellers from far away
Get out of here
I am dead-cold.
Order a flask of wine for me
For two or three gulps, I shall excuse you a month in purgatory
He looks like a drunkard
Beware of everlasting damnation.
You are speaking to a man who ate hard-boiled eggs with the Holy Father last Easter
How can you write me off a month of purgatory if you are not ordained?
I have obtained permission to sell pardons and relics
- Where are you from?
- Under the Prussian lords, from Malbork
You speak our language well What do they call you?
I am a German and my name is Sanderus
I was born at Torun, where all folk speak like that
Even the brothers of the Order understand your language
Innkeeper.
Bring warm beer
- Is it long since you left Malbork?
- Long enough
I have been in the Holy Land then I returned to Malbork and now I carry the holy relics and pardons which pious Christians buy for their soul's salvation
Where have you got those holy wares from?
I have plenary pardons, pardons for 500 years, for 300 and cheaper ones, so that even poor people can buy them and thus shorten the pains of purgatory for themselves...
I have pardons for past sins and for the future ones but I don't keep the money I get for them
A piece of black bread and a drink of water is enough for me
The remainder of what I get I take to Rome to help them to collect in time for a new crusade
And these relics?
Are they important ones?
Such that it is not fitting even to talk of them without taking your hat off
I have a shoe of the ass ridden on by the Holy Family on their flight into Egypt
I have a feather from archangel Gabriel's wing which he lost during the Annunciation
I have some of the oil in which the pagans boiled St. John
I have a rung of the ladder Jacob saw in his dreams and a phial containing wind, which was blowing in the Bethlehem stable
Is the storm over?
Why, no, I suppose we will have to spend Christmas Eve here
Saddle the horses.
Let's go
It's very dangerous now, my Lord, the roads are buried in snow
I have to reach the Duke of Mazovia before Christmas Eve
They will wait, my Lord, and here we may lose our way and perish
You can stay here, you drunkard
I can't.
Who will defend my holy goods?
Don't go, my Lord
- We rode off the highway
- I warned you
- Let's go
- The horses will not go on
Everything is going wrong, my Lord.
One can't see the highway any more
There is a man under the snow
It will snow us over too, my Lord
It will snow us over too, it will snow us over
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
It will snow us over!
Some men...
light...
There are some men there
- Hey!
- You there!
Hey!
Hey!
Is anybody there?
Who are you?
The Duke of Mazovia's men.
We have been sent to help travellers
Follow me, there are some people buried there
It is Jurand
Give me a torch
Rub him with snow
Gracious Lord.
Jurand of Spychow has been found under the snow
You found him?
Bring him here
Danusia?
We tried to find her.
Have you left her back at Spychow?
I was going to her, to Ciechanow...
Why, you have sent men with a letter for her.
Wake up!
By God's mercy, where is my child?
Listen.
There came an armed troop with a letter from you saying that you were injured during a fire
Woe to me.
They have seized my child and they will destroy her
Who?
The Teutonic Knights... de Lowe Godfryd...
Rotgier...
- Was it you who dug me out?
- With the others
- Are you going to help me now?
- Your daughter saved me from death
- Do you love her?
- I belong to her forever...
Even if I have to bite Prussian castles with my teeth, I'll get her
Do you know what the vengeance of the brothers of the Order is?
And now to Spychow
My Lord.
Some monks are waiting for you here
They were bustling about Spychow.
They want to speak with you
- Who are you?
- Pilgrims
- Where from?
- From Szczytno
Where is my child?
He who sent us ordered us not to speak with you in the presence of witnesses
I have no secrets before these men
But we have.
If you bid them to stay we will have to depart
Since it has to be so, you remain alone
Your daughter was kidnapped by robbers
With crosses on their cloaks?
No.
But God blessed the brethren, they rescued her and now she is with them
Where?
Under the protection of the pious brother Szomberg
Szomberg.
The one who strangled Witold's children
He takes good care of her and she will not be harmed
What have I to do to get her back?
- Humble yourself before the Order
- Silence!
- Have you a letter?
- No
We say what we have to say
Nothing evil will happen to your daughter.
The brethren will repay you good for evil if you satisfy their just demands
- What do they want?
- Brother de Bergow released
I will release him
And all the other prisoners you still have at Spychow
I will not bargain for my child
But that is not all
To protect the good name of the Order, the brethren add another condition
You will declare to the Duke and to the whole knighthood that it was robbers who kidnapped your daughter and that you had to pay a ransom to get her back
It is true that robbers kidnapped my child and that I must pay a ransom to them to get her back
You will say that you took a ransom from de Bergow to pay the robbers
I have never taken a ransom
For it was never a question of your child
Or do something else
You may come to Szczytno yourself for your daughter
I?
To Szczytno?
For robbers may again kidnap her on the way and the suspicion will fall on the pious brethren
Who will guarantee my return from Szczytno?
The virtue of the brethren, their justice and piety
I will come to Szczytno.
But both of you will stay here until my return and then you will go with Bergow and the prisoners
You don't want to trust the monks so why should they trust you?
Whoever you are, do not test my patience
Say what you were ordered to say
The brethren told us you have to go to Szczytno without saying a word
Did they not tell you I would break you with a wheel in Spychow?
Your daughter is in the hands of the brethren
What did they want?
Tell us
Are you sick, my Lord?
What news of Danusia?
With what proposal have they come?
With a ransom.
For de Bergow
Where is Danusia?
She is not with the Teutonic Knights
Come closer
He is destined for my daughter and thus he is to be lord here after my death
You will serve him faithfully in peace and in war
Have you heard?
Dear God.
Why are you giving me Spychow already?
I am giving you Danusia
The hour of death is unknown
Where is the master?
- What are your grace's commands?
- I ask you where the master is?
- He is gone
- Where to?
I do not know.
He went heavily armed
The highway will be on the right, beyond the woods and from the knoll you'll see the castle at once
From the knoll, you say?
The castle?
You are not a German, sir, are you?
They did not pay their taxes
The brethren need a lot of money for the war with Samogitis
After the war against the Samogitians is over, they will start another one
Fishing is forbidden hunting too...
The tax on milling is very high and if they find a quern in a hut, they don't even spare children or women
- Now you will find the way yourself
- I will
- God reward you, worshipful master
- God be with you
- Who is there?
- Jurand of Spychow
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander Zygfryd de Lowe bids me to say to you that as long as you do not dismount the gates will not be opened
And your weapons are to be given up
Now, by Order of the Commander you have to put on this horse sack to hang the scabbard of your sword from your neck by a rope... and to wait in humility at the gate until the Commander orders it to be opened
My child
On your feet, dog.
The Commander orders you to appear before him
- Are you Jurand of Spychow?
- I am
The pious Commander bade me to bring you in.
Follow me
- Have you no weapons on you?
- I gave them all up
Beware of bursting into anger.
You are under the force of the Commander
See how the power of the Order conquers malice and pride
- God grants it may always do so
- You bit the Order like a dog
God has caused you to stand before us like a dog with a rope round your neck
Do not compare me with a dog, for you deprive of honour those who have fought with me and perished by my hand
You still spit in pride
I am deprived of pride
By shaming my knighthood, you have shamed yourself
Do not complain that you have been shamed
Though you have been made a kennel man it is better to be the Order's kennel man than one of your knights
By the Passion of the Redeemer and everlasting Salvation, give me back my child as you promised
- Who promised you?
- You did
Commander
The word of a Knight of the Order is to be esteemed as the word of God
How so?
Will you not only let the girl go but also this mad dog to bite us anew?
I trusted Godfryd with this matter.
Be calm, my son
Well, you wolf.
You lapped our blood and now we pay you good for evil
I was hard on you but I was never treacherous
Here you have your child
This is not my daughter.
It is not her
It is not your daughter?
By St. Liborius of Paderborn it means it wasn't your child we rescued from the robbers for there is no other in Szczytno
There is.
I heard her sing
We are all witnesses that we are giving back the girl the robbers thought was Jurand of Spychow's daughter.
If that is not your daughter it is no fault of ours but the will of our Lord
God looks upon your treachery
By the wound of the Redeemer, by the hour of our death, ...give me back my child
If we give her back to you it will be with a bastard of mine
Spare him!
- On what are we taking counsel?
- On our defeat
On what the Grand Master and the Chapter will say and on the means of preventing our actions from harming our Order
- It still smells of blood here
- I ordered the floor to be washed
Where is brother Godfryd's body?
In the chapel.
The brethren are chanting litanies
- Where are the other corpses?
- In the snow to get them stiffened
- Is Jurand alive?
- He is alive
The soldiers wanted to finish him off but the Chaplain did not let them
It was a fatal idea to kidnap Jurand's daughter
Nobody will accuse us if the girl disappears
Pure reason speaks through brother Rotgier's mouth
Then even the Pope or the Roman emperor can take us to court
- What shall we do with the girl?
- Give her to me
No, my son.
When the Order is in question, renounce pleasure
Harden your hearts
Godfryd was reached by the hand of God for he desired not only to avenge the wrongs of the Order but also to satisfy his own lust
The time is near when the Order will be put to severe test
That is an evil night
You, brother de Bergow, will go to the Grand Master of Malbork
You have groaned in captivity with Jurand so they will more readily believe you
Say that before we entangled this madman in a net he managed to kill nine men and among them brother Godfryd
- God grant him everlasting rest
- Amen
And tell him that although we wanted to subdue an enemy of the Order yet none here was the first to draw sword against Jurand
I shall tell everything my eyes have seen
Are you quite certain Rotgier that nobody will learn the truth about Jurand's daughter?
Besides Godfryd, the both of us and the woman servant who watches her nobody knows we have her here
Godfryd ordered the men who brought her here to be hanged
Good
What will you do with Jurand's daughter?
I shall do whatever the good of the Order may require
Have you courage in your heart, my son?
Can you doubt it?
I do not doubt it
For your valiancy, I love you more than anyone in the world
Go then to Duke of Mazovia's court and tell him what happened here as we agreed between us
That's dangerous
It's for the good of the Order
But what if Jurand survives and regains his freedom?
Even though he regains his freedom he will never utter a word of complaint against the Order
Mindful of the Divine command we did not want to slay him although he slew many of our men, first of all brother Godfryd
At last we had to entangle him in a net then he raised the weapon and injured himself terribly
That night people in Szczytno heard laughter and voices calling in the air the enemy of the Cross, the shedder of innocent blood, our Jurand
You say you summoned Jurand to Szczytno?
Yes, gracious lady, when we rescued the crippled girl from the robbers we thought it was Jurand's daughter
How could you think that when you had seen Jurand's real daughter with me in Cracow?
We monks do not raise our eyes to women
Also, there were many maids with the gracious Duchess in Cracow
How did you know about the kidnapping of Jurand's daughter?
The audacity and godlessness of this deed made it known also among us
It is strange you would take the idiot-girl for Jurand's daughter
Perhaps Satan changed her
But robbers could not imitate Jurand's seal or the writing of his priest.
Who could do that?
An evil spirit.
These questions are like swords in my breast for suspicion is concealed behind them
I ask you, did Jurand himself accuse us of this deed?
His letter is available
That is true, there is Jurand's letter concerning robbers
See how the light of truth vanquishes darkness
Reward our losses and our blood, my Lord.
He was your subject
What do you want?
Jurand attacked you in madness.
Have I to be responsible for it?
My Lord, his land and fort in which he imprisoned servants of the Order, lie in your duchy
Let at least that become, henceforth, the Order's property
That payment will not bring our dead brothers to life but perhaps it will appease the divine anger and wipe out the disgrace
Haven't you got enough?
All these countries Eastern Pommerania, Prussia, the Chelmno county which belonged to us and are yours today
Jurand's daughter is still alive
For no-one has told us of her death and you want to rob her dowry
Jurand shed the blood of the brethren of the Order
You admitted the wrong, my Lord
So recompense us as your ducal conscience and your spirit of justice bids you
I come here as the Knight of the Most Holy Virgin ready to defend the honour of the Order with my own blood
If there is anyone, despite what Jurand said who dares to suspect the Order of kidnapping his daughter let him take up this knightly gage and venture on the wager of God's judgement
Is there anyone who will pick up that glove?
I will
Zbyszko of Bogdaniec
I take God as my witness, you, my distinguished Lord and the whole knighthood of this land that I am innocent of this blood that will be shed
They were men in combat according to law and custom in a knightly and proper manner
= The captain / Captain Blood =
Year 1616.
Six years after the assassination of Henry IV, his son, Louis Xlll, turned 15.
The Mother-Queen, Marie of Medicis, who has been ruling in the meantime, honored her protegee, Concini by appointing him Marshal d'Ancres and Prime Minister.
The ambitious Leonore Galigai, Concini's wife is hoping to prevent Louis Xlll from getting the power, with the help of the Mother-Queen and have her husband proclaimed as the new king of France.
Against these sick ambitions, some people have risen: the kingdom's noblemen.
They want to reinstate the stability by bringing Carol of Angouleme on the throne.
In order to preserve his power, Concini uses the most dreadful methods.
Rinaldo, his evil right hand man, would mercilessly kill any one daring to rise against his master.
Be brave, Teynac!
I'm with you.
- Thanks.
You murderer!
You'll pay for this!
You'll pay for killing my friend, Teynac!
I'll find you!
Come here!
Kill him!
Saddle up, quick!
Lean on me!
Put your arm on my shoulder.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Just relax.
Who are you?
You have to stay still if you want your wound to heal.
Stay with me.
- I'm here.
Sleep...
What are you doing here?
- I've been looking after your wound for quite a few days, now.
Who are you?
My name is Beatrice of Beaufort, the cousin of your poor friend, the marquis of Teynac.
Where is the beautiful brunette who was nursing me?
Which brunette?
I remember now.
He's put down a man that was trying to kill me.
You have to relax, or your wound will re-open.
You still need a lot of rest.
Believe me,
I deeply condemn the acts of robbery that a lot of you have been victims of.
Mister governor, you can no longer allow robbers and thieving groups to enter our province.
Not long after count of Pourtel, our friend, the marquis of Teynac has been murdered, along with his family.
We need to provide people with arms.
I can't give you any permissions.
My orders are clear.
Who issues these orders?
- The Marshal d'Ancre.
Mother-Queen's favorite, Concino Concini...
He's the only one who can decide our fate.
He's the prime minister.
He can't possibly understand what's going on here.
I'll make him understand.
- Think you could do it better than me?
I'll go to Louvres, if your council assigns me with carrying our written complaints to the prime minister.
Of course.
Concini is a government lackey.
He won't move a finger for us.
Then I'll go to the king!
Our king is much too young.
He's barely 15.
The Parliament declared him an adult, at his age.
The regency of the Mother-Queen has ended.
He's the only one that can decide for us.
On behalf of everyone, I thank the knight Francois of Capestang for having accepted this mission.
As a governor of the Provence region,
I can only give you a mandate for seeing the prime minister.
Once you're in Paris, anything you'll decide remember that you're on your own.
Approach, ladies and gentlemen!
Come watch the magnificent Cogolin!
Cheer for the century's most beautiful representation.
Come closer, beautiful ladies, and you, children...
Come to see the most mysterious and magical show on earth.
Come have fun with master Cogolin...
Little one, can you watch my horse?
- ...
King of troubadours!
Stay there!
What happened?
Are you mocking me?
You don't believe in my powers?
He's defying me!
Right!
Now you beg for forgiveness!
If we'd only just have to kiss to make up for a mistake, it would be too easy.
I don't want you doubting my powers.
Which I will once again prove!
Miss, pick a card!
Any card.
That one...
All right.
Don't show it to me!
Put it back in the deck.
Thanks!
Now I'll mix them up.
And now it's my turn to guess the card.
Let me think...
Could this be it?
Something tells me it's not this one.
Let's see.
Maybe this one?
Something tells me it's not this one either!
Maybe this one?
Queen of spades.
I'm the troubadour.
Welcome, dear lovebirds, to my garden!
May you be happy forever!
You ain't seen nothing yet!
If it was up to my king...
I could have become the minister of finance.
I'd have left you all in rags.
But whatever I take, I give back - for I'm no politician, but a poet.
It's my choice.
I stay honest.
I have nothing, I want nothing!
And if it happens that I'm stretching out my hand it's only to offer luck to the kind-hearted!
I'm the troubadour!
I realize I no longer bother you.
Now you want to salute by yourself.
It's him!
Release him!
What happened?
- Singing time's over!
Dancing time's over too.
- Come on, move!
What the...
- We're collecting now!
Hand over the sack.
Most noble gentlemen...
No butt-kissing!
Either hand over the sack, or we'll beat you to death!
Shake him well!
He might still have money in his pockets!
I'll suffocate!
- Lift him up!
No!
be careful!
- You said you've got nothing on you!
You know what happens to liars?
Their tongue gets cut!
Have mercy, leave my tongue.
That's my way of living.
Help!
Murderers!
- Grab him by the head and take off his boots!
He's got brand new boots.
If you so much as move your fingers, we'll chop off your leg.
I'm not moving any fingers.
I've got blisters.
Come on, pull!
You two, get to the wagon!
- I'm out of here!
You're going to leave me naked, like this?
It's not comfortable at all.
The nights are cold here.
- You'll be all right.
The wolves and night hawks are going to show up quicker than you'll have time to scare off the birds.
Let's go!
Don't leave me like this!
Have mercy!
We must be quite a sight!
Now you can be proud!
- You're a guard dog.
This suits you better.
Are you done howling?
If you think you'll cheer me up like this...
Help!
Finally!
It's true you have a beautiful voice.
What happened to you, poor singer?
They took everything.
Left me with nothing!
Because of the cold, I'm starting to feel a little numb.
It seems there are also wolves around here.
May I ask who I owe my life to?
I am knight Francis of Tremasenc of Capestang.
My name is simpler:
Cogolin.
Jump on, troubadour!
On weather like this...
You're very kind to take me with you.
I remembered you've returned to me the money that have been stolen.
Aren't you afraid you're going to draw attention upon yourself with such a passenger?
Easy!
The Golden Apple Inn.
Did you see that?
The clothes may be of no importance, but when you're not planning on becoming a monk, a little elegance suits you.
Your wine, gentlemen!
Thank you.
Did you hear that?
"Gentlemen"...
I became irresistible.
All thanks to you.
I don't even know how to thank you.
If I wasn't a poet, I'd have liked to be your servant.
The gratitude is pushing me, yet the muse forbids it.
Isn't that so?
Your conscience makes you an honorable man.
What about the muse, though, would she approve of you being a companion and a friend to a knight?
Yes, to sing about his romances.
My romances?
I only dream of one.
For the better.
I'd have less work to do.
But it's...
You're not feeling well?
- It's her!
Your great love?
Should I already start to write?
I'm dreaming!
It's certainly not a nightmare.
I knew I wasn't dreaming!
Mister, please!
What is this?
It was you who saved my life at Teynac's castle!
You shot a perpetrator.
Do you think such method is suitable for a gentleman?
Who's the lady?
- I don't know, master.
But you seemed to know her.
In a job like mine, you always have to pretend you recognize people.
That makes them feel flattered.
Tell me her name!
- Master, I don't have a memory for names.
I know you have to have imagination in order to seduce women, but I would have never came up with the "pistol-shooting" story.
I did not come up with that.
Here!
Take this sack and buy a round for everyone, including the servants of the young lady.
Make them talk!
I want to know her name, at any cost.
Long live the new wine!
Why did he leave you alone?
Because he has two faults.
He doesn't drink and he's suspicious.
Why?
Well, it's natural.
When one has to fulfill a task such as he has...
What kind of task?
I got no clue.
He never talks about it.
Do you think I know why he's on his way to Louvre?
To Louvre?
Yes.
It's none of my concern what he and Marshal d'Ancre have to talk about.
He's talking to Concini?
Don't put words in my mouth!
And if you're trying to get me drunk in order to talk...
It won't work, as I have to get up early.
I'm up to bed.
Good night!
You're a mess.
- I beg your pardon?
Did they talk?
Come to think of it, the new wine unchains a lot of tongues.
It seems yours is unchained for real.
Did they even say anything to you?
They taught me a song I did not know.
Long live the wine!
Get in!
- Long live the new wine!
Cogolin, quick!
Her carriage is leaving!
Let's jump on the horses!
Quicker!
- I'm doing the best I can!
Look, there's the carriage...
I will lead.
You come after me.
And hurry!
I'll try.
Love gives you wings.
But since I'm not in love, I don't feel like killing my legs.
The day starts well.
I have to choose: either a hero, or a poet.
One can't be both.
Now you're coming?
- The poor animal is limping.
How's that happened?
- You probably didn't pick it too well.
Lift the leg up!
Look, a stone!
It's stuck in his hoof.
You moron.
I'm not a horse doctor.
- Come on, hurry up!
Do you really think you're going to catch her before she arrives in Paris?
So, the Marshal d'Ancre has finally agreed to see you.
You've been waiting for his reception for eight days now.
Wait here for me!
I won't be too long.
- You think?
Why not think it?
Why didn't Concini receive you when you were introduced to him, at the Louvre?
Why did he call you to his residence?
Why is everyone saying that it's much easier getting in there than getting out?
What are you afraid of?
I'm the one who's going to go in there.
Sir?
- Marshal d'Ancre awaits me.
I'm really content with you, Miss de Beaufort.
You've brought me some very interesting news.
I will sign you father's pardon tomorow.
Marshal, Sir, you promised me...
- I promised you I will pardon him.
As for his freedom, that's only up to you.
Bring me one more piece of information as important as the one you brought now and I promise I'll get your father out of Bastille.
Talk to the majordomo on the upper floor!
I would like to speak to Marshal d'Ancre.
I am the knight of Capestang.
Very well, Sir.
Did you understand my instructions?
- Yes, Marshal.
Knight of Capestang, Sir!
He's here!
Send him in.
And send my orders to Rinaldo.
I'll call you!
- All right, Sir!
If he's looking for trouble, he's about to find it eventually.
In the name of my province's council, thanks for receiving me.
Please, be seated.
Knight, you've come a long way to tell me what I already know.
Shouldn't you take some exceptional measures on the matter, Marshal?
The gangs of villains rob and prey throughout the provinces.
They even had the nerve to attack a girl's carriage in a forest really close to Paris.
Mr. Knight, I know everything about the matter.
Some wanderer got involved in a matter that didn't concern him.
He allowed an accomplice, Giselle of Angouleme, to get away.
He's committed a high treason crime, which makes him a candidate for execution.
Lucky for you, Sir, the accomplice that you've protected fell into our hands when exiting the forest.
Mister de Capestang, I know few things about you.
I know you're brave, and a good fighter.
You're faithful, even with no noble blood.
Be my friend, and I will make you one of the greatest seniors in the kingdom.
Marshal, what do you want from me?
- For now, to be honest, not much.
Take a walk through Paris, cursing out my name and you'll make a lot of friends quickly.
You'll be accepted into the group of conspirators at once.
You want me to conspire against you?
- Don't pretend you didn't understand.
You will inform me of what my enemies think.
With your help I will strangle this vain and delusional nobility.
See?
It's simple.
Yes, it's simple.
True.
You told me I am a man of good faith.
And you're right.
But no matter how humble my origin is,
I don't think any of my ancestors would have accepted to become an informant.
By advancing such a proposition, you've insulted a Capestang.
Capestang!
They should call you "Capitan".
The captain from the Italian comedies, with the wooden sword that always needs to be smacked in order to be brought to sense.
I offer you a title, you answer with insolence.
You make me laugh, Capitan!
Capitan?
So be it!
I will be one.
I will accept this mockery.
It's not our name that makes us honorable.
Polichinelle said that low-life and cowardice have a name too, and it's sometimes a noble one.
This insolence is a luxury I don't think you can afford, Sir!
I am amused by it...
But many people aren't like me.
Be careful!
Show Mr. de Capestang out!
Lead him to the councilor that takes care of the provinces' business.
Follow me, Knight!
He's been in there for quite a long time.
And
I don't think Concini asked him to dinner.
Mr. de Capestang, give up your sword!
Come and get it, you murderer!
You'll pay for killing Marquis de Teynac!
Go!
Quick!
Get him!
Good bye!
Closer!
Hold the horse!
Thank you, Cogolin!
This cabin will soon look as new.
Concini's men will not look for us in the heart of the forest.
We'll be better off than in any inn.
Rest...
We want to get rest, and the girl is Concini's prisoner.
Come!
The fencing lesson!
- I'd rather finish here first.
You'll finish afterwards.
Come and train for a bit.
If I want my plan to work, it has to at least look like you have some fighting skills.
All right.
Careful!
You imagine that everything will go on the way you planned?
Why not? "En garde", my beautiful knight!
Not like that!
You hold it like a broom.
Don't make me laugh.
I won't be able to do anything.
Besides, I'm afraid I might get hurt.
- This animal is offending me.
En garde!
Right foot forward!
The right one!
Yes.
Hold the weapon with strength, and keep the blade pointing at me.
I do.
Heads up!
Suck the belly, stretch your bottom!
Tight elbows, get your knees further apart.
I won't look natural!
- You need to look threatening!
All right.
Don't lose my sight.
Point the blade at me!
If you'd just freeze, it would be simpler!
- Turn towards me!
I need to start all over again!
- Attack!
Lunge.
What if I attack your head, how will you block it?
- With the elbow upwards.
No.
What's that move?
- I'm blocking!
Bravo!
- Is it good?
What if I attack you at blade point?
How do you respond?
No!
Don't you realize?
If I was slipping forward, you'd have pierced me.
You should put something on top.
It really hurts.
Now you do a...
I want to know how will I disarm you in our next battle.
I don't want to be always in danger.
If you want that, I'll show you.
You point the top of your blade at me.
Do it!
The top?
- Now I've wrapped your move.
Yes.
- You lean and I'll swipe off your sword!
So I'm disarmed.
But I don't understand one thing.
If you want to kill Concini, why don't you do it as soon as you attack?
Gisele d'Angouleme is his hostage and she'd be killed on the spot.
Good thinking!
We must be slick.
It's up to you to help me find out where they keep her.
I stick to my plan.
- I stick to my skin.
Point the top of your sword at me and attack!
- And I disarm you!
I wrap your move and...
Ough, now I'm disarmed too!
Gentlemen, you do know the reason why we're here.
Miss Gisele d'Angouleme has gone missing.
Her carriage was attacked while she was on her way to Count of Poitiers trying to convince him to join our league.
When she went to see Marquis of Teynac with the same proposition,
Concini's scoundrels set his castle on fire.
And she was almost caught.
Which leads us to believe she's now Concini's prisoner.
He'll probably use her as a hostage, against us.
Gentlemen, we must not be stopped by anything, not even by the somber threats that have gathered upon my daughter, Gisele and upon our people that are now in Concini's hands.
We shall stick to the oath we took here.
I decide nothing shall stop us from reaching our purpose.
We will remove Concini and crown Carol of Angouleme,
A strong an prophetic sovereign that our country needs.
Long live king Carol of Angouleme!
Long live king Carol!
In this residence Concini hides his shameful lovers.
That must be his carriage.
Hide there and try to rise to the occasion.
You try not to get caught!
My sack, Sir.
- Come and get it, you scoundrel!
Help!
You coward, you hit an unarmed man?
Shame on you!
Murderer!
Are you crazy?
Disarm me!
I can't!
Start over!
Easy.
What do I do now?
Murderer!
I'm sorry for sticking my nose in your business.
But I took this liberty because...
You've done well.
You're brave.
Even though your sword skill surprised me at times
I realized you're more efficient than my own guards which I'm paying too much.
I'm not a skillful swordsman, Sir, but my father was an armourer.
He taught me a few moves of defense, good for when one's always traveling.
Traveling?
What do you do?
- Just a troubadour.
I owe you my life.
How can I repay you?
No, not like that, Sir!
But...
What?
Name it!
I can recite a poem, I can sing, I can entertain people.
But what's an artist without a protector?
Come to Louvres tomorrow.
I need loyal people.
Ask about Marshal d'Ancre.
Marshal d'Ancre?
!
Thank heavens!
I'm so proud of myself!
By fighting for you, I feel like I've been fighting for France.
He's a true dancer.
All he needs now is to speak.
Dance!
Like that!
As a poet, I need the flame of the muses.
Here it is!
In order for it not to go extinct, I'll keep it here.
Wise!
Now I can ask the charming lady with your Majesty's permission, to bring me her fan?
Only a muse with seducing eyes can increase the creation flame of a poet.
Are you that muse?
Maybe!
I might be.
But there's no doubt!
Why keep these flames in plain sight when they're meant to only lit my heart?
Isn't it so, charming lady?
As thanks, allow me to offer you a few flowers.
A buffoon for a king.
That's all we needed, my dear wife.
Let him laugh.
It's normal for his age.
Besides, like this he'll dream less to a kingdom.
The mother queen thinks the same.
Just look at her!
The king seems to be highly entertained by this clown.
It's the type of distraction that he lacked the most.
let's just hope it'll take his mind away from all the responsibilities not suitable for his age.
Things that his friends are trying to bring up too often.
Tell me your name, charming lady!
My name is Cogolino.
What is yours?
My name?
- Yes!
My name?
- Yes!
Giuseppa!
- Giuseppa!
What a beautiful name!
"Cogolino" is beautiful!
- Yes it is.
Is this your palace?
- It is.
If I was a king, you'd be my queen.
I don't understand French too well!
It's for the better!
I'm rather shy, so this will give me a chance to open up!
What eyes!
What a mouth, what...
I understand that!
- Forgive me!
After you've done your work, can you come and sing me a song?
I beg your pardon?
Can you come later and enchant me with a song?
A song... to sing later?
- Yes.
Why not?
I'm just a poor troubadour that doesn't speak Dante's language.
In order to confess my love, it's better to sing it.
You could be my beauty from sunny Italy!
I know you understand.
Yes, yes, yes.
Tell me a word of comfort, even though I wouldn't understand it.
It sounds so good in Italian.
Since I can't confess my love to you...
We'll just smile at each other.
Yes, yes, yes.
This language is the message
of our hearts, bewitched and happy.
To whisper words of love, there's no need for speeches
We'll always understand each other.
When in love, a true romantic never mistakes night for day.
The words are always the same and we'll sing them in our songs.
To whisper words of love, there's no need for speeches
We'll always understand each other.
Listening to you, I understood the beautiful language that's spoken here, in Paris.
I'll tell you what these words mean.
Oh, my darling, you're so beautiful!
You're my little angel, so handsome!
Come here!
Stop!
I got it!
You want me to come to you.
Yes, yes!
Let's not wait any longer.
Let's be tender with each other.
Let's talk, finally, by touching each other's hands.
To whisper words of love, there's no need for speeches
We'll always understand each other.
When in love, a true romantic never, never mistakes night for day.
The words are always the same and we can sing them in our songs.
To whisper words of love, there's no need for speeches
We'll always understand each other.
Hand in hand, we'll walk on the same road together.
And whisper phrases of love.
Hand in hand, walking together...
Whispering phrases of love.
Oh my God!
The Mother-Queen!
- Quick!
Fripon!
Marshal, the person you've sent for is here.
Does Your Majesty allow me to retire?
You may get out!
So, what's your answer, Miss d'Angouleme?
No!
You're not smart at all.
All I want you to do is send your father a letter
Asking him to forget about his plans, and I'll set you free.
No!
You'll just use that letter as an excuse to kill us all.
Do you really believe that a Marshal of France would go that low?
I don't know on what battlefield you've earned your Marshal stripes but, like everyone else, I know how you've earned the Prime Minister title.
Bedding the Mother-Queen!
I've always been a fan of certain audacities, lady, but right now you're out of line!
Do you know for words like these I could have you tortured?
To me, your presence in the same room is a torture in itself.
I see you don't understand me, a thing that saddens me deeply.
My intentions regarding you are...
How shall I put it?
How dare you?
Since this is where we stand, I'll send you back to the Castle of Clairefond.
I hope you'll be well treated there and won't lack anything you desire.
After all, it's the kingdom's best prison.
A few months of solitude will change you, I hope.
They'll make you less aggressive, more understanding.
Please, try to understand me, young lady!
All I want is for you to be happy and for France to be glorious.
Take the lady back to the Castle of Clairefond!
Lady, follow me!
So?
Do you know where she is?
Concini just sent her back to Clairefond.
Let's move right now!
- Let me breathe a little!
There's no time.
I'm familiar with the Castle of Clairefond.
In order for our plan to succeed we'll need a third horse and a few objects I have to teach you how to use.
It's awesome how many new things I'm learning!
Fencing, Italian language...
What else?
You shall see!
- I think I might become a multi-level scholar.
Put the saddle on my horse!
There's the Castle of Clairefond!
I knew it was hard to get out of that place, but this one seems impossible to get into.
Don't worry about it!
I have a plan.
You'll never make it!
- We'll see about that.
And there's the dawn.
It's for the best.
I'll see what I'm up to!
The castle's fortress, out of our sight, to the right... is connected to the land through a mobile bridge.
Why not use that bridge?
No.
That would be the under permanent surveillance.
My only chance is to get through here.
What?
I got to warn you, I can't swim.
You'll do exactly as I say.
You go around the pond until you reach the mobile bridge...
And try to get back by the time we'll get here.
All right.
I got it.
Let's just hope it won't blow up before I get there.
Be patient!
You realize, of course, it's gun powder!
How beautiful love is...
Take me to Gisele d'Angouleme's cell!
Yes, sir!
You?
- Yes.
Me, again!
The least they can say about you, is you're a very hard to find girl.
The keys!
Lie down in the boat!
Come and take a look!
What's with that boat leaving?
You're finally here!
Everything all right?
I was so scared!
Are you hurt?
- Nothing serious.
I can move my arm!
Try putting it around my neck, so I can carry you.
We can't take that way no more.
The mobile bridge has been destroyed.
Your ordeal is finally over.
You've been very brave.
- I owed you at least that.
Does it hurt bad?
- No, it's nothing, believe me!
You're so brave!
You're brave too, Cogolin.
With him behind me, I have no other choice.
Are you cold?
- A little.
Go and build a fire, quick!
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm going to have to leave you.
I need to get back to Louvre tonight.
Or else I will be noticed as absent.
Are you all right there?
Good bye.
Thank you.
- Good bye.
Why did you do all this for me?
It's mostly because, some time ago, at the Castle of Teynac,
I dreamed you killed a man who was trying to kill me.
It was then when I had the feeling you're the bravest, most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
It might have been just a dream, but I'm not ready to forget it yet.
Giselle, was it you then, at the castle?
Yes, it was me.
Why have you been hiding from me all along?
I couldn't tell you anything.
But you'll soon find out what this is all about.
Giselle...
Giselle, I'm...
What?
There are feeling I find hard to express right now.
You've proved them in the most wonderful way, though!
Come next Friday, around midnight in front of the Church Saint-Nicolas of Meudon.
This ring will be your recognition sign.
A friend shall lead you to where I am.
Giselle.
Help!
My horse's gone wild!
Lorenzo has distilled here a poison that doesn't show, once mixed with wine and it doesn't change the taste of it either.
Are you sure it's effective?
- Instantly, sir!
I'll take it to the king's chamber.
He'll be served like he is every day, with an assorted plate of delicacies and his favorite wine.
Let's just hope that this will be more effective then the drug we've prepared for his horse.
The horse acted exactly as we've predicted, sir.
And this poison will have the expected effect too.
You can trust him, my friend.
Lorenzo is the best alchemist I've known.
And the most devoted one.
You're quite famous.
I've learned you count your victims by the hundreds.
They were only bad people, sir, the enemies of my friends.
What's the secret of your genius, you diabolical magician?
The nature has played me a prank and I'm not finished paying it back.
The knight of Capestang is asking if Your Majesty can receive him.
Let him in.
Glad to see you again, sir!
Friendly faces a so few here, at Louvre!
I hope I shall prove myself worthy of the honor Your Majesty is doing me!
You see?
He's the King's friend.
The King's friend!
Since our friends' friends are our friends
I've became, somehow, the King's friend too.
You didn't get that?
You're pretty anyway!
Why didn't you bring straight to me the wishes of the committee you represent?
The governor has directed me to Marshal d'Ancre, Your Majesty!
Did he receive you well?
In fact he refused to let me leave.
- Tell me all about it!
I've came to Louvre several times, in order to be received my Marshal d'Ancre.
Now he's portraying the Marshal quite well.
"Portraying him"?
You didn't get that?
Well, you're pretty anyway!
Everything you tell me is just confirming what I already know.
It's painful that, at my age, I have to understand some people are just capable of anything.
Like some are capable of faithfulness and loyalty.
- Your Majesty, you've got mine!
I believe you and I thank you!
Even as a king, sometimes it's hard to do the right thing.
I've got so few friends...
I'm glad to add another one to the count.
Be ready to respond when I'll call for you!
Your Majesty, it is my most valuable duty to serve you and be your servant!
Right now, to fight by your side because your very existence is a warranty for peace and justice in the kingdom.
Thank you.
I will rely on your friendship and devotion.
The day when I'll need you is near.
It's wiser I come with you.
You might have some unpleasant encounters in this palace.
Marshal, allow me to introduce my close friend knight Francois of Capestang.
"Capitan" for the ones close to me.
"Capitan"?
Does Your Majesty still receive comedians?
Better to receive them then appoint them ministers!
Fripon!
Come here!
Here!
Hide!
Have you no shame?
Hide!
You're bad!
You rascal!
Hide!
Stop!
You scoundrel!
A valet dares to drink wine out of the king's cup!
Hand me the cup!
Don't you know this honor is reserved solely for Marshal d'Ancre's guards?
Poison!
It was poison!
Cogolino!
Cogolino!
Say something, Cogolino!
My God...
Cogolino, say something!
- What are you doing here?
Leave!
Out!
Rinaldo!
Put these fools' bodies in some sacks and fill them with stones.
Toss them in the Seine!
Go now!
Let's not stay here!
Better not to make a fuss about what happened.
I'm not dead!
Come!
- Yes, now!
Where is he?
Come!
Stop him!
Catch the spy!
I have to find you who he's working for!
Take him to the torture chamber!
Forgive me, gentlemen, I think I've reached the wrong floor.
Will you talk now?
- I know nothing, sir!
Who were you spying for?
- Not spying, sir!
I'm thirsty!
For real!
Talk!
Tell me everything, and I'll set you free!
Talk!
I swear I'll release you!
Say something!
Fire.
Come in!
Open up!
In the name of the king!
Long live the king!
My God, Cogolino!
Marshal, how dare you torture my buffoon?
Majesty, he's a dangerous spy!
I assume your purpose is to make him talk!
Yes, Sir.
In the best interest of Your Majesty!
I'm under the impression, Marshal, that I can make him talk even without the torture.
Get out, Marshal!
Wait for me outside!
Let me do it, Sir!
When the king will get out...
It's too early!
You were right, Marshal!
That man needed to talk!
He confessed everything.
You see, it's hard enough for me to realize that in the Louvre, in my own palace
I live among a bunch of traitors, spies and assassins.
I've never hid that from you, Majesty!
You need to take extreme measures!
That's why I believe that I was right, in the earlier incident.
You're always right, Marshal.
But it's time we talk seriously about these matters.
Please, follow me to my chambers!
Where are they?
- I don't know!
The king's lead them out of the palace through the back door.
Looking for someone?
This way.
When confronting the audacity of the horrible scoundrel that claims he serves France we shall forget our old misunderstandings.
Let's make a promise, in this memorable moment that we'll stand together until victory and that we'll fight to the death in order to bring down and destroy the infamous Concini.
Let's swear we'll set as King of France the only true inheritor of the Valois House, duke Carol de Angouleme, so he shall be our king.
I swear!
I gladly see that we're all in agreement.
No, gentlemen!
- What are you talking about?
Who are you to dare act like this?
Francis of Capestang.
Sir Capestang, I know my daughter owes you her life and her freedom however, for your audacity you should be put to trial.
Trial me, I don't care!
You can't condemn my king without listening to what I've got to say!
Enough!
- This is too much!
We're listening!
I did not wait to meet you all just to fight against Concini, I did it anyway.
What do you blame the king for, though?
That he's young?
That's he's alone against all?
Against Concini and his men, against his own mother!
Louis xiii not only was always worthy of his throne but also showed great courage.
His weakness doesn't lie within him, but lies in all of you.
Since you're not prepared to help him win this fight.
Did you king order you here to manipulate us on his behalf?
I need no orders to do what's right, Sir!
Who told you the place of our secret meeting?
I can't tell!
That's like admitting you're one of Concini's spies.
Knight of Capestang came here at my request.
I knew you were Concini's enemy and I've seen how brave you are.
I wanted to ask you to join us.
You may leave.
If your decision is already made up, you'll never be one of us.
You have to understand what this means.
I can fight along your side against Concini.
But never against the king.
Who'll guarantee us he won't betray us?
I will!
The hypocrisy it's our enemies' most dangerous weapon.
A weapon that you know nothing about, right?
If I'd been guilty of the crimes I've been accused of
I would have known how to hide better and play the innocent.
May it be that my failures in trying to get your voice to be heard to stand proof for my loyalty for Your Majesty.
If only I could be a "captain".
It's obvious you're not forgiving him for leaving the camp especially since he took someone with him.
Who did he take?
- Giselle d'Angouleme, Your Majesty.
Giselle d'Angouleme?
Didn't he tell you he's the author of her escape?
Why didn't you brink me a report of this escape?
I was waiting to gather up solid proofs.
I will never accuse someone without proof, Sir.
And I shall produce these proofs, Your Majesty!
All right.
Will the duke of Angouleme and his daughter be at the meeting?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
This is the order that shall set your father free.
Mister De Neuville, governor of Bastille, will set him free tomorrow.
Beatrice, if you want
I can arrange that for your father to be re-instated starting tonight.
I believe this discussion has taken too much time.
Get out, young lady!
For the favors this girl has shown you, you've freed my greatest enemy.
Do you really think I'm that stupid?
The noble prisoner has been methodically tortured, with no results, by the way.
He didn't take that too well, along with the special conditions he's been under.
The girl's father is dead for seven days now.
So this leaves us to...
- Yes.
Tonight, I will apply my most trusted methods.
Rinaldo shall do what he must.
Tomorrow you'll be queen.
I need to talk to you.
I'm a traitor.
In order to obtain my father's release, I've betrayed my friends.
My father meant everything to me.
My betrayal didn't even save him.
He died in prison eight days ago, suffering and being miserable, after they tortured him.
I meant to tell everything to Giselle, but the shame stopped me.
If you don't notify them on time, the heads of the conspirators that will gather up today, at the Saint-Leo Castle will fall right into Concini's trap.
Help me, please!
Your youth has never prepared you for such trials.
The love for your father has blinded you.
I pity you.
Yet, if there's someone guilty for all this, it's Concini.
Come!
It's not right to listen to a friend's door, the way we did.
We're in enough trouble with the brunette, Giselle d'Angouleme.
I need to find out what kind of torment this beautiful blonde will bring upon us.
We can't be living only on love and water.
That's why I brought you some soup.
Look!
A cabin and a heart.
This is my lifelong dream.
Mine too, Cogolino!
We're finally alone!
We can tell each other words of love.
Come in!
Where's the knight of Capestang?
- Who's asking, please?
The king.
Your Majesty!
Forgive the mess!
If I had known you'd come, I'd have cleaned up a bit.
Where is the knight of Capestang?
He's on the run all the time, never standing in one place.
I want to know where he is, you understand?
A young blonde woman came and took him to the Saint-Leo Castle, at the conspirators' meeting.
Saint-Leo Castle?
- Yes, Sir!
But I swear, Sir, it's not the conspiracy he's interested in, but something else.
Are you going to tell me what it is?
I don't think he went there for the sake of the Duke d'Angouleme, but rather for his daughter.
I think he's madly in love.
That's why he can easily fall into a trap.
A trap?
Let's go, gentlemen!
Move!
Gentlemen, you're familiar with the purpose of this meeting.
Now we have to figure out how to act.
The time has come...
- Let me through!
Sir, you won't get in here!
- Let me through!
There's no place for you here!
- Silence, please!
Knight of Capestang!
I've already warned you that if you came back...
Concini's men are going to be here from one moment to another.
How would you know if you're not the traitor himself?
In another time, I'd have demanded satisfaction for such an accusation.
Who'd believe you came here out of kindness?
Not only I've told you I'm fighting by your side in order to save someone that I hold very dear.
But I also said that if I fight this fight it will be out of loyalty for the king.
Because I know, once they'd have dealt with you
Concini's people will turn against the king!
And you, gentlemen, if you fight for the glory of France believe there won't be any glory unless you'll wipe out these bastards.
Join the just cause, our young king's cause!
Catch that man!
He's a traitor!
No!
I was the one that betrayed you!
Murderer!
This time you won't escape me!
Go, go!
- Why the hurry?
Because we're living an historical moment and I don't want to miss it.
What does this mean...
an historical moment?
Some very hard times which, if we'll survive them guarantee our staying in history.
Now that I know your tricks, let me teach you some of mine!
Let your soul go to God!
Stop the fight, gentlemen!
By orders of the king!
I find you in a strange comradeship, Sir!
I trusted you, gave you my friendship and you promised me yours.
You swore to defend your king no matter what and yet I find you fighting by the conspirators' side.
Miss d'Angouleme, you are the daughter of the person that Concini called "my greatest enemy".
You could have killed me, yet you spared my life.
Ask me for any favor, I shall grant it.
I'm not asking for clemency neither for my family, nor for the people that were loyal to us.
But I will tell you one thing:
the knight of Capestang has always been your most faithful servant.
Before this fight, he was trying, for the second time to persuade us to fight for your cause.
I was merely looking for a shred of proof, young lady and you've offered it to me with nobility, just like I hoped.
I never doubted the knight of Capestang.
I know he has fought along your side, against your enemies because he knew once they had won, they would have turned against me.
This is the proof!
Concini wanted to divide us.
But that's all in the past now.
This morning, by my orders, Concini was executed by hanging.
I told you these are historical times.
In spite your youth, you've proven yourself as a great king.
Gentlemen, Concini is dead.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Cousin, the liaison I hoped for, between the
House of Valois and the House of Bourbon can undoubtedly exist.
The attitude and the words of Miss d'Angouleme have convinced me of it.
I believe her and my friend, Francis of Capestang can become our families' strongest symbol of reunion.
I approve without hesitation, Your Majesty!
This time, we can finally say to each other words of love.

You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination.
That's the signpost up ahead.
Your next stop, the twilight zone.
I know it's...
it's an incredible story.
I, of all people, know this, that you won't believe me no, not at first.
But i'm going to tell you the whole thing.
Then you will believe, because you must.
You must believe!
It happened many years ago, after the first world war.
I was on a walking trip through central europe.
But one night i...
one night i got lost in a storm.
Yes?
What is it?
Please... please, let me in.
I'm lost.
I'm sorry, we don't allow visitors in the hermitage.
Oh, i'm not a visitor.
I'm... i'm a stranger here.
I'm... i'm lost.
No, you don't understand.
I'm lost.
I'll be all right once i dry out.
Wait here.
I have to speak to brother jerome.
Brother jerome will see you now.
What was that?
The wind.
Come.
Why have you come here?
My... my name is ellington.
I'm on a walking trip, but got lost in the storm.
Excuse me.
I saw light here.
What do you want from us?
Shelter and maybe some food.
We cannot help you.
You will have to leave.
Now, mr.
Ellington... now.
The prostrate form of mr.
David ellington- scholar, seeker of truth, and regrettably, finder of truth- a man who will shortly arise from his exhaustion to confront a problem that has tormented mankind since the beginning of time- a man who knocked on a door seeking sanctuary
and found instead the outer edges of the twilight zone.
Help me!
No, please, in the name of mercy, help me.
You're not one of them.
No, my name is ellington.
I'm an american.
Shh!
We have only moments.
Come closer... come.
They're mad, mr.
Ellington... all of them, raving mad.
Listen, i was in the village in schwartzwald.
I was walking in the street with my woman.
We paused to rest by a tree and we kissed.
Is it wrong to kiss?
Tell me.
I... i don't think so.
Of course you don't.
You don't think so, i don't think so.
But jerome...
the lecherous old fool.
We looked up... and i saw him standing close by.
I tried to open my mouth to speak, but before i could utter a sound, he raised that heavy staff he carries.
You've seen it?
And he hit me again and again.
Why?
For revenge.
Because she refused his advances.
He took his fury out on me.
I... i'm sorry, i... i find this difficult to believe.
Of course you do, mr.
Ellington.
That's the strength of the man.
He makes his madness seem a harmless thing.
The... the madness of a religious zealot.
This is not a religious order, mr.
Ellington.
These so-called brothers of truth, they're outcasts, misfits, cut off from the world because the world won't have them.
Mr. Ellington, please.
You must believe me.
I don't say they're evil.
I say they're mad.
Where are you going?
I'll speak to jerome.
No!
He's the greatest maniac of them all.
But then how can i help you?
Mr. Ellington!
I did not know that you were well enough to walk.
Come with me, please.
I must talk with you.
This way.
I must ask you to leave the hermitage, mr.
Ellington.
We have no facilities for the care of the ill.
Arrangements can made at schwartzwald.
Just a minute.
No, not a minute, not another second, mr.
Ellington - now!
Why?
I have already explained that.
No, you've explained nothing.
No one asked me to come here, i realize that, but that's no excuse for your behavior.
My son... i'm not your son.
You don't understand.
That's right, i don't.
So why don't you tell me?
Why are you in such a hurry for me to leave?
What are you afraid i'll find out?
It's the man you have locked up in the cell, isn't it, brother?
Well, that isn't a secret anymore.
I know about him.
What man is this, mr.
Ellington?
The one we just left.
The one who's been screaming his head off.
I'm not sure you know what you're saying.
Look, brother, i don't know much about this cult of yours- what's permitted, what isn't permitted- but i seriously doubt if you have the authority to imprison a man against his will.
That is quite true.
We have no such authority.
Then why have you done it?
No man has ever been imprisoned in the hermitage, mr.
Ellington.
I was just talking with him.
You talked to no man.
You have been very ill, mr.
Ellington.
You've suffered delirium.
Oh, now don't tell me you didn't hear that.
Honest men make unconvincing liars.
I'll find out eventually, you know?
What do you mean?
Just what i say.
The police will be very interested to learn that you people are keeping a man in prison here.
I tell you, there is no man!
All right, just forget it.
Mr. Ellington... yes?
Would you really go to the police?
Would you?
Very well.
I have told you the truth but only a part of it.
Now i see i shall have to tell you the whole truth.
Shut the door, mr.
Ellington.
Then you do hear it?
As i have heard it every hour of every day for five long years.
Why did you lie?
I didn't.
When i told you that no man howled at the hermitage, i was being perfectly honest.
What you saw is not a man.
It is the devil himself.
Yes, the devil himself.
What you saw in the cell is satan.
Otherwise known as the dark angel, ahriman, asmodeus, belial, diabolus, the devil.
You asked for the truth.
Now you have it.
You do believe me, don't you?
Uh... sure, of course.
No, now it is you who are lying, mr.
Ellington.
You don't believe me at all.
Quite to the contrary.
You're now quite certain of what you suspected- that i am mad.
Sit down, mr.
Ellington and we'll see.
Let me tell you a story and we'll see how certain you are that i am mad- how certain you are of anything.
I suppose you fancy yourself a sophisticated man.
You consider us to be primitive because we live here in solitude, away from the so-called "real world."
We are misfits.
No, no... oh, please.
I know all the theories.
I assure you, brother, that... no, mr.
Ellington.
It is i who am assuring you.
I am not the ignorant fanatic i would appear.
Oh, i coped with your world for 40 years... and rather successfully at that.
The best schools, a degree in philosophy, a job that took me to the ends of the earth.
This beard... this staff... and this faith... are merely the results of a different point of view.
If you could understand that, you could listen to what i have to say with an open mind.
Five years ago, there were no howls in the hermitage.
There was simply the bombed-out ruin of an old castle belonging to the family wolfen.
Baron wolfen gave it to the brotherhood of truth as a gesture of charity.
Our job was to tend the vineyards and save what souls we could by constant prayer.
But this isn't a religious order, is it, brother?
We feel that we are recognized by god.
Truth is our dogma.
We believe it to be man's greatest weapon against the devil, who is the father of all lies.
All right, go on with your story.
You were tending the vineyards.
At that time, shortly after the great war, the world was in chaos.
Everywhere was unhappiness except in this little village below.
For some reason, the people of schwartzwald refused to yield to despair.
They lost none of their faith.
They continued as they had been for centuries- honest, god-fearing and happy.
This village was a plum to satan one he could not resist, so he came here and embarked upon a program of corruption.
But you stopped him.
Yes!
You see, mr.
Ellington, he made the same mistake thatyouhave made.
He underestimatedme.
He thought he would have no difficulty in tempting the old fool.
But i had him in a cell before he knew what happened.
But if he's the devil, how do you keep him locked up?
With the staff of truth- the one barrier he cannot pass.
Tell me, how did yourecognize him?
He doesn't look evil.
The devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape.
I had seen him before in all parts of the world in all forms and guises, wherever there was sin wherever there was strife wherever there was corruption, persecution there he was also.
Sometimes he was only a spectator, a face in the crowd, but always he was there.
Now... you see, i hope, why you must say nothing of what you've seen and heard here.
Brother, it's not that i doubt you you understand, only isn't it possible you might have made a mistake?
No!
Think, mr.
Ellington.
Think of the peace of the world these last five years.
Think of this country now.
Is there another like it?
You haven't put an end to suffering.
There's still murders, robberies.
Even now while we're talking, people are starving.
The suffering man wasmeantto endure.
We cause most of our own griefs.
We need no help from him.
It is the unnatural catastrophes, the great wars, the overwhelming pestilences the wholesale sinning that we have stopped.
I believe you, brother.
Do youtruly?
Yes.
I admit, i was doubtful at first, but you've convinced me, absolutely.
I promise to keep your secret.
Good, my son.
Tomorrow, if you feel well enough, you may leave.
In the meantime, brother christophorus will look after you.
Please, go directly to his room.
Good night, brother.
He lied to you, didn't he?
I can see that.
What did he say?
He said you were the devil.
The devil... that's good.
That's wonderful.
What a dream for an old devil- to catch the devil and lock him up.
You don't believe him, do you?
No, of course not.
Then help me.
Look, here, why don't i just go get the authorities?
It would be my death warrant.
The authorities would return and find nothing.
Jerome is mad... but he's shrewd, too.
Brother jerome was fearful you might lose your way.
Come.
Why are you locking the door?
To protect you.
Rest now, mr.
Ellington.
Remember you're still a very sick man.
You've come.
Good!
What do you want me to do?
Lift off the wooden bolt.
Is this all that holds you in?
Yes, lift it off.
Well, why haven't you done it yourself?
Please, there's no time for talk.
Mr. Ellington, in the name of mercy.
If you fail now, they'll kill both of us.
Don't you understand that?
Hurry, hurry!
Stop!
Stop!
Put this on- the storm.
I'm sorry for you, my son.
All your life you will remember this night and you'll know, mr.
Ellington whom you have turned loose upon the world.
I... i didn't believe you.
I... i saw him and didn't recognize him.
That is man's weakness and satan's strength.
In that moment i decided to spend the rest of my life tracking him down to recapture the evil i'd released the evil that soon took the shape of the second world war the korean war, the hideous new weapons of war.
I swore i'd find him again as brother jerome had done.
It took many years, but i did it.
See, i have him in there now.
So you understand now?
You understand why you must not under any circumstances, go near that door.
You see how important it is that he stay locked up.
Good.
I am sending him back to brother jerome.
He'll do a bit of howling, but pay no attention to that.
It's a trick, i know.
Yes, i must go now.
I must go, i... i have preparations to make.
I'll be back in just a few minutes.
Remember... remember... keep that door locked.
You can catch the devil, but you can't hold him long.
Ask brother jerome, ask david ellington.
They know, and they'll go on knowing till the end of their days, and beyond, in the twilight zone.
Rod serling, creator of the twilight zone, will tell you about next week's story after this word from our alternate sponsor.
And now, mr.
Serling.
Next week, you'll see these bandages unwrapped, and you'll get a good, close look at the face beneath them.
It's an excursion into the odd and into the very, very different.
Our play is called "the eye of the beholder,"
and it comes recommended.
I hope we'll see you next week onthe twilight zone.
Thank you and good night.
Be sure and see the colgate-palmolive company's new comedy show, my sister eileen wednesday night on many of these same stations.
(wolf howling)
Oh, I don't see any sign of tracks.
Not a sign.
Look, why don't we split up, meet up by that rimrock?
All right.
Be mighty careful, Little Joe.
If we get that ol' timber wolf all boxed in, he ain't gonna be at all sociable.
Right.
(cocks rifle)
(wolf howling)
Hey!
(gasps)
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey!
Little Joe, where are you?
!
Down here, Hoss!
Hey, Joe, that ain't no lobo.
Sure ain't.
Well, what is she, an Indian girl?
No, looks like a Gypsy to me.
HOSS:
Yeah.
Hey, I ain't never seen one of them up close before.
I almost killed her.
How?
I thought she was that wolf.
(howling)
(theme song playing)
Gypsy girl.
Well, we were aware of that, Doctor.
Is she going to be all right?
Can't hurt a Gypsy.
They're built to endure.
I don't know, Doc.
She looked like she was pretty well shook up to me.
Oh, she'll come out of it all right.
Just give her a day in bed, and then send her on her way.
Yeah, well, where's that?
Wherever her people are.
Well, we don't exactly know where her people are, Doctor.
Oh?
Well, soon as she's on her feet, you'd best turn her over to the sheriff in Virginia City.
What for?
She didn't do anything.
She will, boy; she will.
Just give her a chance.
She's a Gypsy, isn't she?
Is that as bad as being an Injun?
Sometimes it's worse.
Evening, Ben, Little Joe, Hoss.
Good night, Doc.
Good night, Doc.
Good night, Doc.
He doesn't care much for Gypsies, does he?
I guess a lot of people don't trust them much.
A lot of people don't trust no tumbleweed folk much.
Oh, I don't think that little girl can do much harm while she's here with us.
Maybe when she wakes up, we can find out where her people are.
She sure is pretty, ain't she, Little Joe?
She sure is;
like nothing I've ever seen.
(rattling, rustling)
Sounds like she's waking up.
Better take a look at her.
No, I'll, I'll check her, Pa.
Hey, Pa?
How come Adam didn't come back with the doctor?
Oh, he's staying in town overnight.
Go away.
I won't hurt you.
Where is this place?
It's the Ponderosa.
Nevada.
How's your head?
Go away.
It's cold.
It's cold, and I think that you ought to keep the cover over you.
Hey!
Hey, what'd you do that for?
All right, you just go ahead and freeze, if you want to.
Well?
How is she?
If Gypsies are supposed to be mean, she's doing fine.
What'd you do to your hand?
She bit me.
She bit you?
Uh-huh.
Listen, Little Joe, if a Gypsy's bite's anything like a polecat's, you're in trouble.
If you start foaming at the mouth...
Yeah, I know.
Drink plenty of Jamaica ginger.
Why did she bite you?
I don't know.
Hmm.
Say anything about her folks?
What happened to her?
No, nothing.
I'll talk to the girl in the morning.
I wouldn't get too close to her.
(door closes)
You see that star?
Yeah, that's the North Star.
I would like to reach up and pluck it out of the sky.
(chuckles)
Oh, it's a long ways up.
No, it's so close I can feel the cold on my face.
Oh, maybe you better get back in bed.
The night is the inside of a black bell.
It rings forth the spirits of the dead.
(wolf howling)
Don't worry.
It's just that lobo wolf we've been trying to catch.
Go away.
And will you bite me again if I don't?
Where are the folks you belong to?
I have no one.
Oh, now, come on, everybody has someone.
Why do you care about me?
Is it because I am pretty and you want to kiss me?
Come and do it.
I am waiting for you.
Now, look, I don't know what's bothering you, but I brought you here and I feel responsible for you.
Now, I want to find out where you belong and that's all.
You are walking in your father's shoes.
And what does that mean?
You're playing like you are a man, but you are a little boy.
Oh, and what makes you so grown-up?
I am past being grown-up.
I am old and withered.
I am dead.
And I don't know what you're talking about.
You're the craziest girl I ever ran into.
Go away before I turn you into a toad.
You don't have to eat crumbs, young lady.
Have a decent breakfast, if you want it.
I don't need your food.
Well, you're welcome to it if you should need it.
My name is Ben Cartwright.
You are a rich man, Ben Cartwright.
Well, I...
I do have much to be grateful for.
I would have to steal to have so much.
Well, there are other ways.
Tell me, what were you doing out there all alone?
Howling at the moon.
(laughs)
Well, I suppose that is respectable for young wolves, but not for young ladies.
Where are your people?
Why do you want to know?
Would you invite them to eat with you?
Well, I want to know, so that I can return a young girl to them.
I think they've lost one.
They did not lose me.
I am not like them.
I'm different.
Well, how?
What makes you different?
There is no one in front of me, and no one in back.
I may go anywhere I want to go, and be whatever I wish to be.
Well, what is it that you wish to be?
I wish to be free.
I do not like your house.
(chickens clucking, woman shrieks)
(screaming)
(horses whinnying)
(screams)
What's wrong?
Go away.
What's the matter?
Hey, give me that.
Let me go!
Not till I find out what's going through that crazy head of yours.
Why do you try to kill yourself?
I am gafe.
I am a witch.
The animals, they know it.
If you mean those horses, it was your dress that spooked them.
They're not used to bright colors, nothing else.
No.
It is the dark star.
It is the dark star!
Lookie there, Pa;
it looks like them
Gypsies are gonna make camp right here on the Ponderosa.
No, they probably come to pick up our young friend.
How'd they know she was here?
Oh, Doctor.
I imagine it's all over Virginia City by now.
They did not come for me.
Now, look, young lady, I don't know what problems you may have had with your people before, but don't you think it's time to straighten them out now?
You do not understand.
No...
I guess you're right;
I don't.
I have three sons and no daughters.
I've always found women a mite harder to understand than men.
They're more sensitive and...
Now, look, I'll, uh...
I'll forget about those dishes if you'll come along now and give things another try.
No.
Well, those are your people.
You belong with them.
No.
Well, all right.
If Muhammad won't go to the mountain...
(violin playing melancholy tune)
Zurka... we have visitors.
Oh, welcome, friends!
I, Zurka, welcome you.
I should be welcoming you.
My name is Ben Cartwright.
My son Hoss.
This is the Ponderosa, Cartwright land.
If you don't mind my asking, how did you get through our fence line?
Oh, it is in need of repair.
Fences are always in need of repair.
(chuckling)
I presume you came to pick up the girl.
The girl?
Yes, we, uh, found her half-dead in the timber country.
Gypsy girl.
You are barosan... my brother.
You're a great man, I can see it.
I am sure that you will let my people stay on your beautiful land until the dark sky clears.
We are heading across the mountains to the place where the mustangs run wild.
What about the girl?
She's no longer one of us.
She's gafe, a bringer of misfortune.
BEN:
She's a child.
ZURKA:
Oh, the devil is fond of children.
You mean to...
you mean to say that that poor little girl... you think she's bewitched?
We know it, barosan.
You left her here to die.
We left her behind us.
She's a human being.
She's not an animal.
Now, we have laws in this country governing responsibility.
We stay away from the law, and the law stays away from us.
BEN:
Maybe you won't be able to do that this time.
ZURKA:
Well, I...
I'll think it over, barosan.
You will let us stay, huh?
On one condition.
That you take the girl and go when the weather clears.
I can promise you that we will go.
All right.
But now, barosan, when we are here, maybe we can do some business.
We have fine horses to sell.
Well, we buy our horses in Virginia City.
But none like the beasts of Roman!
Huh, Spiro?
Backs like iron, hoofs like the wind.
Well, Pa, it can't do no harm to take a look at 'em.
(sighs) Well...
What do you want for the stallions?
$150 apiece.
How much?
For both.
All three?
No... (chuckles)
They aren't worth half that.
Oh, you're a hard man to deal with, barosan.
No, not usually.
These horses have been fixed.
Oh, the Indians have been known to use similar methods.
Teeth have bored and filled with birchwood to hide their age.
This one's leg's been blistered on this side to balance up with that lame one on the other one, too, Pa.
Touch of arsenic in their feed?
You insult us!
I was right.
You're a great man, barosan, with an eye of a Gypsy.
I like you.
My wife will tell your fortune for nothing.
(chuckling):
I'm afraid not.
No, no, but, but we will talk.
You will tell me your life and I will tell you my life.
Another time.
No, no, no, tonight.
Tonight is All Hallows' Eve.
It's a big celebration.
We'll have a roast pig and we will dance and drink kümmel-- a lot of kümmel.
You will join us.
BEN:
I'm afraid not.
But you must come.
You must bring the pig.
Uh, you do have a pig, huh?
(chuckling):
Yes, we have a pig.
So bring the pig and you are welcome.
Well, I'm afraid we're saving our pig for a little celebration of our own.
Well... so don't bring the pig and you are welcome, too.
Thanks anyway.
Enjoy yourselves.
And remember what I said about the girl.
I expect you to come for her.
And stay in good health... barosan.
Hi.
You know, I still don't know your name.
Tirza.
Why do they call you Little Joe?
Ah, it's just a nickname.
It doesn't mean anything.
The venom of spiders protects us from wild animals and savage dogs.
(chuckles)
A Colt .45'll do the same thing.
It will not rain tonight.
Tirza, what did you mean about the dark star being a witch?
When I was a little girl, I sat by a stream like this.
I watched the fish and dreamed that I was one of them, slipping through the warm silence, my silver scales reflecting sunlight.
Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to want to be a grizzly.
I can be a fish if I want.
What are you doing?
Digging for wild artichokes.
The gophers store them, and I am hungry.
You're sure a funny girl.
Why did you stop me?
When?
Before.
Why'd you try to kill yourself?
For the same reason I bit you.
Why is that?
Because I am a witch.
(horse neighs)
(horse snorts)
Are you strong, Tirza?
Yes, strong and well.
I'm Joe Cartwright.
Go away, gajo, back to your own kind.
Go watch over your kingdom.
Leave us alone.
If Tirza wants me to leave, then I will.
What do you want, Spiro?
To see that you are happy.
I did not know they left you behind until it was too late.
It was the old woman's work.
And if you had known?
What then?
I might have changed her mind.
The bruja is my grandmother.
I can influence her.
A glass of metaxa, a laugh or two-- she would listen to me.
And all you would want for that service is to hold me in your arms for all the nights that are to come.
Maybe not all.
I would rather lie in the arms of a snake.
(grunts)
(gasps)
(yells)
(grunts)
Drop it.
I said drop it.
(splashes)
All right, get on your horse and clear out.
Remember my face, gajo.
It'll be the last one you see in this world.
(pigs snorting)
(squealing)
Not only do they think she's bewitched, she thinks so, too.
Sounds like they've been driving it home hard enough to her to make her believe it.
Hmm.
Where is she now?
She's asleep.
She's quite a girl, though.
Isn't she, Joe?
Yeah, Pa.
Adam, you don't think there'll be anything worthwhile at the auction?
No, I didn't like the looks of those mustangs.
Kind of runty.
I understand the, uh, Gypsies tried to peddle some of their broken down geldings that they'd fixed up.
(laughing):
Yeah.
Did quite a good job, too.
You know, the average buyer probably wouldn't notice the difference for quite some time.
Well, they'd have to go some to outfox you, Pa.
(door closes) HOSS:
Hey, Pa.
One of our little Poland China pigs is plumb gone.
Oh...
Seems I was supposed to supply a pig, one way or another.
Yeah, and it looks like you did get outfoxed.
No, I didn't, because they're going to pay for that pig, one way or another.
I don't know, Pa, that old Gypsy, Zurka, he could charm his way out of a Comanche scalping'.
He's not going to charm his way out of paying for that pig.
Well, this I gotta see.
Yeah, me, too.
How about you, Adam?
Come on along.
No, I think I'd better keep an eye on the house in case they, uh, back in one of the wagons and take out the furniture.
(all laughing)
(children playing)
(violin playing melancholy melody)
(laughs):
Oh!
Is a pleasure to have you here, barosan.
I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I have the strange feeling that that pig belongs to me.
Does it?
I don't know.
I-I-I really don't know, barosan.
It wandered here into the camp, poor lost soul.
Uh, do you think it is yours?
Now, Zurka, you know it is.
That's a very expensive animal.
Oh, I'm very sorry, barosan.
I...
I don't know how to repay you.
I have only a few dollars.
But maybe you would consider a barter?
Wait.
Barosan, it is not much, but it is pure silver and carved with...
with a loving heart.
I, I-- this-this, this is worth much, much more than that pig.
No, I couldn't possibly take it.
But, look, I took your pig, too.
It will ease my conscience.
Please, take it.
Let's not talk about it and we'll have a drink.
I-I don't know, I...
You must taste some of your pig.
* *
What's that?
It is milk...
Hmm.
mixed with the blood of an unborn calf.
BEN:
It's a delicacy, Hoss.
ZURKA:
It will give you strength.
Yes, sir.
Zurka, tell me.
Why do you think the girl is bewitched?
Oh... she was born under the dark star.
Her mother died in her efforts.
It's very bad.
Well, does a mother's death make a child evil?
Mm, sometimes.
You know, our beliefs are old and strong.
We must live as they tell us.
Is there nothing in your beliefs about mercy, compassion?
Yes, but is it possible to have mercy and compassion for a girl who can turn herself into a wolf?
(shouts)
(giggling)
* *
* *
(upbeat, lively tempo begins)
(shouts)
(thunder rumbles, musicians stop playing)
(thunder rumbles)
Go after your son, barosan.
Zurka, I respect your beliefs, but I'm not a man who goes along much with spirits and witches and the like.
You know, I've found that the only evil in this world is the human kind.
But the evil in man doesn't come from nowhere.
It is born in a dark world, beyond the world we know.
And it's sent here on purpose.
You really believe that girl can turn herself into a wolf.
Yes.
She must plague our house.
The devil drives her.
He possesses our children and drives them against us.
She's evil, believe me.
No, I can't believe it.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do think that poor girl is suffering.
Not from an evil in her, but from some kind of despair and loneliness because her own people rejected her and persecuted her.
You are a gajo.
You're a civilized man.
The understanding for the devil and his ways has been bred out of you.
Zurka, have you ever seen any real evidence of the devil in her?
Or are you afraid of her because she was unlucky enough to have been born under some weather-obscured star.
You know, a man, possibly you've never heard of him, once said, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."
I like your words-- uh, good words.
But not our words.
I have seen too much of evil.
(thunder rumbles)
Go after your son.
He's in danger.
The danger is in the flesh, not fantasy.
My son can take pretty good care of himself in that department.
Zurka...
Give the girl a chance.
You may be wrong.
Maybe.
But I'm not.
Well...
I guess it's not going to storm after all.
Well... thanks for the silver bowl.
And thanks for the pig.
You run faster than any buck deer I ever saw.
Little Joe, Little Joe...
Like a black panther from the depths of night in a dark dream.
Once I saw my lover steal away.
Why'd you come in the camp and dance like that?
To frighten them.
To see their faces.
There are so many things I just can't understand about you.
We live in two worlds, Little Joe.
In my world, there are demons and spirits who eat up living souls like grain, and fly about the night in wagons made of smoke.
I am one of them.
I know it.
And my people know it.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't want you talking that way anymore.
You're no more a witch than I am.
Somehow they've got you thinking things that just don't make sense.
You are a tree.
I see you as a tree.
So firm, a part of the land, with your roots dug deep into the ground.
Your arm is like a branch.
I wish I were a tree.
I would stand over little children and guard them from harm.
Maybe I am not a witch.
Maybe I, maybe I am good to think such thoughts.
Of course you're good.
I know you are.
Your heart is beating.
Is it because I am near you?
Yes.
Am I beautiful?
You're very beautiful.
Can we talk of love sometime?
Hold me.
Hold me.
Little Joe...
(wolf howling)
(howling)
* *
(wolf howling)
(howling continues)
Please...
Please help me.
You refused our help.
You were driven away from our house.
The devil is in me.
Help me.
There's only one way to help you.
Do you know what that means?
It means pain beyond anything you've ever known.
Agony that will tear at your mind and sear your soul.
I don't care.
Even if it would mean my death.
(wind whistling)
(door opening and closing)
* *
(wolf howling)
(distant howling)
Anybody here?
!
Gajo!
Where's Tirza?
She's in the mountains.
There is nothing you can do for her now, gajo.
She is a devil.
She has changed herself into a wolf and slaughtered chickens.
My people are going to help her.
What do you mean "help her"?
They are going to stake her to the ground and pick at her soul, until she screams for mercy.
But they will only dig deeper until they have found the rotten spot and scooped it out.
And then, they will leave her body limp and her mind a useless thing.
(whip cracks)
I could have killed you both on your moonlit rock of love.
It would have been easy.
It would have been too easy.
It would have only given me a moment or two.
This way, I can see them scar her mind as she has scarred my face.
I can make you crawl as I have crawled.
(whip cracks, Little Joe moans)
(grunts)
(whip cracks)
(clattering)
(grunts)
(grunts)
(all chanting mournful tune, beating tambourine)
I know what they're trying to do, Tirza.
Don't let them!
But I want them to.
Don't you see?
No, I don't see.
All I see is a lot of talk that doesn't make sense.
But it does.
The devil is in me.
They will take him away and make my soul as clean as air.
Tirza, don't!
(chanting)
(chanting stops)
Asmodeus... the Bruja is here.
She will drive you back into the world of the dead.
At the end of the world, there's a hole through which one can descend in the underworld.
This can be reached by following the direction taken by the setting sun.
The journey should be made on two cocks harnessed together.
(chanting resumes)
In the underworld, it is time to sleep.
It takes two months walking through darkness before one sees a light.
It is a cavernous passage guarded by nine white dogs.
The passage leads directly to the castle of the black, man-eating emperor.
The castle is in that flagon.
(hissing)
And when it bursts, he shall be released from the soul of this girl.
What's your name?
Tirza.
How old are you?
Nineteen.
How long has the devil been in you?
How long?
Since my birth.
Why does he possess you?
Tell me.
Tell me.
Oh...
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
What is the devil's name?
I don't know.
What is his name?
As...
Asmodeus.
Asmodeus.
Can you see him now?
No.
I want you to see him.
See his goat's face and fiery eyes.
The hairy, twisted body and the cloven hoof.
(hissing) Blood.
Bones.
Claws.
Hoofs.
Horns.
Can you see him now?
No.
Three times from east to west.
And three times from west to east.
Scorpions, feathers, spider web--
I conjure thee, Asmodeus.
I exorcise thee, O ancient serpent, by the judge of the living and the dead, that from this girl, thou, with fears and afflictions of thy fury, speedily depart.
(Tirza moans)
(onlookers scream)
Little Joe...
I am free.
Coffee?
No, no thanks.
I, uh...
I wanted to talk to you.
Go ahead, boy.
Well, you remember once you told us that we could have a piece of this land when it was time.
That's right.
Is it time, boy?
Yes, sir.
Well, if that's what you want.
Tirza's a fine, young woman.
I'd be proud to have her for a daughter.
(knocking on door)
Zurka, come in.
Come in, please.
Well, barosan, the sky clears, so we are on our way, as I promised.
Uh-huh.
It was a good land, and we are grateful for the hospitality.
Well...
The girl is coming with us.
Our house is her house now.
Tirza's not going with you.
You want her, young man?
Yes.
But it is our way that if a man marries, he is to join the girl's family.
You have to become a Gypsy.
Tirza's going to stay here with me.
TIRZA:
No, Little Joe.
I cannot stay.
What do you mean you can't stay?
Remember the fish in the stream?
I wanted to be one of them.
I am one of them now.
I've waited so long to see love in their eyes, instead of fear and hate.
It is in my heart to go.
Tirza, you can't go.
Do you understand, I love you more than anything in my life?
You are a tree, Joe, not a fish.
You must stand tall and watch over this land that is yours.
Tirza, I...
Stay.
Stay here.
And think of me sometimes when the stars are in the skies.
I will have memories of you always.
Good-bye, Little Joe.
You have a good son.
I always wished to have a son like this.
So many times, I tried to make a son of Spiro.
Yes, I'm...
I'm sorry about Spiro.
He's better off in the land of the Mulos.
He'll find peace and... judgment for his sins.
Then you know what he was trying to do?
Yes.
We found the wolf's paw on his body.
It was still wet with blood.
It was our mistake.
You know, Zurka, sometimes it's possible to see the devil when you're looking for the devil.
Our mistake was that we didn't see the devil in Spiro.
Hmm, maybe so.
Good-bye, my brother, and may you have a long life.

The 7th Year of Tenpo
The year 1836...
The poor crop of the year caused a severe famine throughout Japan.
Since the Shogun's Government was afraid of the farmers revolting they tyrannized over peasantry to maintain feudalism.
Farmers faced starvation.
Some deserted their houses and fields and roamed about with aimless hopes.
Kunisada Village
Come quick!
Hey!
Stop it!
Are you from Kunisada Village?
You're leaving the village?
Why are you leaving?
We don't want to leave.
There's no food.
We can't live.
I don't want leave our homes.
I want to die on the land of my ancestors.
I don't want to leave.
Listen...
This is not much, folks.
Make porridge with this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You saved us.
Restaurant Funayoshi
Welcome!
Hello, Kansuke.
Hi, Chief.
Patrolling?
Aren't you jolly?
Some more farmers left the village today.
Some go away others come to fish in troubled waters.
It's an interesting world.
You boys.
This is Chief Kansuke.
Greet him.
Meet Isuke and Tamazo.
They are my new men.
You quit farming and work for the magistrate?
How admirable!
Chief Kansuke.
Long time no see.
Have some sake.
Give me a cup of tea.
Sure.
Hot one, right?
Chief.
You won't accept my cup?
That's not true, but now...
He says he doesn't want sake when there's no rice in the village.
Who's there?
Who's standing there?
Toku.
I'm Gantetsu.
Why, Ganetsu...
Are you with Chuji?
Chuji's back?
Is it true?
I heard a rumor he's coming back.
What's wrong?
Why look troubled?
If he comes back, I must arrest him.
You should've come back half a year earlier.
Where have you been?
An awful thing happened at Chuji's.
Somebody there?
Excuse me.
Mother.
It's me, Chuji.
Anybody?
Kiku!
It's you!
What's the matter, Kiku?
It's your brother.
Can't you see?
Forgive me.
Help!
It's me, your brother.
It's Chuji!
Please.
What's the matter?
You devil, Jubei!
Mother.
What happened to Mom?
Come back at once, Chuji.
Boss.
Welcome home.
You're so late.
Uncle.
Who's there?
How are you, Uncle?
It's you, Asataro.
You've come back?
Your boss Chuji is a fugitive from justice.
His description is widely circulated.
Don't stay around here.
Uncle...
Don't "uncle" me so openly.
Are you with Boss Chuji?
No, I came back alone.
Then, if you see him tell him to leave the village quietly whatever he may see here.
I'm now in the police force.
I'll be forced to arrest him as soon as I see him.
Don't do such a thing.
Shut up!
Asa.
Do you know what your mother told me on her deathbed?
She wanted you to die a natural death.
Quit gambling and become a farmer.
I'll be starved.
Fool!
You should rather die than gamble.
Daddy!
You've awaked Kantaro.
Shall I see him?
No!
If you want to see him, quit gambling.
He may have grown up.
Listen, Asa, I'm getting old.
I'm old.
Why don't you quit gambling and live with us quietly?
No?
I appreciate your kindness...
Who is it?
Never mind.
Nobody.
Come, come, let's go to bed.
I'll be with you.
Immediately after you left the Magistrate sent his men and confiscated fields from your mother.
Didn't Village Mayor Uemon protect her?
He could do nothing against the Magistrate.
My family was innocent.
They had nothing to do with what I did.
No argument with the Magistrate.
He took away Kiku by force.
She was to marry Tosaku.
Life was hard on him, too.
He could hardly support himself.
Kiku lost her mind when she was violated by Magistrate Matsui Jubei.
That's why your mother...
Mother.
I should have come back earlier.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
You're late!
Yosaku, close the door now.
Nobody followed you, right?
The government doesn't let us either die or live but only suffer.
It's better if they won't let us die, but we will eventually.
I can't even poop.
Now it's very clear what's on the magistrate's mind.
They think they can take whatever we have as much they want.
What about we go to fight them?
You mean we start a uprising?
There are some farmers did uprising in other places.
I can't tolerate anymore!
Let's do it!
I heard there were 100 straw rice bags in their place.
That's right.
- Let's do it.
But we'll get beheaded and displayed in public.
Yosaku.
I want to talk to you.
Come out.
Chuji's back...
Will Chuji break into the magistrate's home?
Possible.
Because his sister was violated by him.
How can a gambler understand farmers' suffering.
Yosaku.
Do you have anything to say to me?
We've been friends since we were little.
Kiku was supposed to be your wife, wasn't she?
Didn't you come to propose marriage to her?
Say something!
When Kiku became mad and was kicked out from the administrator's home...
How did your face look like?
You were just watching with your thumb in your mouth?
Are you still a man!
?
Say something!
Sorry...
That's all?
It won't help anything even if I broke into the magistrate's home alone.
I only have a hoe to carry.
Then what about Kiku?
What?
Chuji came here?
I let him wait in front of the storehouse.
Go to get the key of the storehouse.
Hi, Chuji!
Long time no see.
When did you come back?
Yes.
I came back last night.
It's been three years since I left Kunisada Village.
I missed here.
Come in here.
I think you've heard already that our village is in trouble.
How is Kiku doing?
She's home.
I'm sorry for her, but you should just give up.
The opponent is powerful.
Kiku was negligent.
Oh, that's what you think?
If you cooperate...
I would always help you as a land owner.
By the way, our people are in a difficult situation.
Would you please help them?
I knew you came here for that.
That's why I let you come to talk in my storehouse.
Look.
As you can see, we got nothing this year.
I did my best to help farmers though.
The warehouse in the north is empty too?
That one is empty too.
Do you doubt what you tell you?
No, of course not.
You can only find rice in the storehouse in the magistrate's home.
Kiku.
Kiku.
It's me, Yosaku.
You beast!
Let's kill the magistrate and avenge Kiku.
Listen...
If you'd do nothing to avenge your sister you'd be laughed at.
What can we do?
We're only three.
I want to reorganize my group first.
Then avenge Kiku.
Kill the magistrate, and give rice to the farmers.
Serves two ends.
Killing him doesn't mean relieving the farmers.
Welcome home, Chuji.
When will he come home, Mother?
Asa.
Did you see your uncle?
Yes, I did.
But he'll never tell on you.
He's indebted to you.
That's nothing.
How is he?
He's fine.
Why don't you live with him?
What?
Your uncle really loves you.
You needn't be with me.
Quit gambling, go to him and make him happy.
Boss.
I have pledged loyalty to you.
Why, Boss?
Why should he do that?
Welcome home, brother.
A gambler brings misery to his family.
Chuji!
Chuji!
Yosaku, what's the matter?
Get a hold of yourself!
Chuji.
I tried to avenge Kiku.
To the magist...
What?
You alone?
Be strong!
Hang in there!
Yosaku!
And Jubei?
Jubei...
Chuji, avenge me.
Kiku...
Yosaku!
Kiku.
Yosaku!
Kiku!
Fool!
Kiku!
Boss.
Enzo.
I heard everything.
Boss, make up your mind.
Let's kill the magistrate.
Matsui Jubei!
I've come to kill you!
Jubei!
You're pretty good.
I, a gambler came to avenge my sister!
Fool!
I'll have your head soon.
Enzo, break the door!
What?
Chuji did?
And the magistrate...
Killed?
No, not that, but...
Arrest Chuji.
Where's Kansuke?
Quick, Chief.
I know.
Don't get excited.
Quick, please.
What a trouble!
Hurry up!
All right.
Where are you going?
I'll be right back.
Be an angel and go to bed now.
Chuji made an attack!
Here's the rice!
Your rice!
Take it as much as you can.
Have a rest.
The farmers are on their guard.
Let's attack the gambling places and get money from rich idlers.
Good idea.
It's no time gambling.
You agree?
Let's give the farmers money, too.
Good.
We have revolted against the government in a way.
Your men will come back.
Wait.
Hold a funeral for Kiku and Yosaku first.
Sure.
A big one.
Boss!
Bunzo.
I'm back.
How are you?
Let me relieve you.
Game!
Quiet!
I won't hurt you.
But I'll take the money.
Quiet!
We're Chuji's men.
We'll borrow this money.
And use it wisely.
Oh, gold!
Chuji's present.
What's that gold?
Gold, gold...
Sorry...
Where did you get the gold?
Go faster!
You're under arrest, Chuji!
A magistrate governs the area for the Shogun.
He must not be insulted.
Besides, we can't harm the dignity of money for those gamblers.
Arrest Chuji and all other gamblers, and they shall be beheaded.
Everyone of them, understood?
The governor constantly sends his men to catch us.
We'll soon be caught if we still stay in village.
Boss...
Let's hide in Mt.
Akagi.
I won't leave here until I kill Jubei.
I won't escape.
Not an escape.
We wait for a chance and attack him.
Boss.
The police are coming.
All right.
Mt.
Akagi.
To Mt.
Akagi, boys.
Toku!
Toku!
We'll go into Mt.
Akagi.
Let's go!
I'll come back.
One year has passed since Chuji went up to Mt.
Akagi
Off limits.
Offenders shall be punished as Chuji's associates.
The investigation by the government has intensified
Enzo is playing again.
We've spent a year here.
Many have deserted us.
Only half remain.
Those remaining here are all firmly united.
How dirty we are.
One year's grime.
How I wish to have a bath.
Who is it?
I'm Niemon.
We've brought rice for Boss.
Really?
Thank you.
He'll be pleased.
We'll help you.
Show him the way.
The farmers have brought us rice.
I'm much obliged.
How are you, Boss?
Thank you.
I'm fine.
We wanted to have you eat this year's crop.
You had a crop?
Thanks to you.
Hear that?
A crop.
Good!
Look.
We owe it to you.
Not us.
Your efforts.
Carrots, potatoes...
We brought as much as we could.
Please eat them.
Wonderful!
Like a treasure ship.
And clothes from Toku.
How could you get through the cordon?
I'm really grateful.
Every road is under strict watch.
What are you going to do from now?
Wait and see.
Be careful not to be found.
Send them off, Asa.
Let's go.
Take good care of yourself.
Tell the villagers I'm in good shape.
Be careful.
Thank you.
We'll come up again.
Good luck.
Take care.
Enzo.
Think of it.
They brought us rice at the risk of their lives.
We feel grateful.
But how could they come up?
Why are you rubbing the radish?
This reminds me...
Of what?
Haven't you known a girl?
That's odd.
You said women scare you.
No, I care for them.
Boss!
What is it?
Police arrested...
Where?
By the cedars.
Wait!
We must help them.
You'll be trapped.
They're trying to decoy us.
Enzo.
The boys can enjoy a nice supper today.
He went out, as you guessed.
He's worried about the farmers who were caught.
Follow him secretly.
Understood.
Welcome.
Please have a sit.
Please.
Give me a shave.
Boss!
Don't be so loud.
Sorry.
Niemon was caught because he took rice to you.
He was beaten up.
Beaten up, and that's all?
But I feel sorry.
How are you men doing?
They're wrestling with bears.
Wrestling with bears?
You don't even understand a joke.
Everybody says so too.
Toku is getting on well.
Is she?
Working at "Funayoshi"?
Anxious about her?
The cops don't touch her.
They're waiting for you to come to her.
Be quick.
I'll go to tell her about you.
Don't.
Bright moon!
What?
It's pitch-dark.
Ah, yes.
You're funny.
A customer?
What a go!
No good?
What is it?
Night-blindness.
I can't get over it.
Eat a monkey's liver.
Boil it well and eat it with rice.
Monkey's liver?
It's you, Kuma?
Wait for me.
I'll soon be back.
He's a new detective from Edo.
He's night-blind, and can't see.
Then how could he see Kuma through a hole in the screen?
You're right...
He saw me, and pretended to be blind.
He'll come again.
Okay now?
No, not yet.
In a few minutes.
I'll wait.
It's chilly tonight.
Thank you for waiting.
You're under arrest!
Sis!
Don't go out!
Don't let him escape!
What are you doing?
You can't burn down my house.
Oh, Chief Kansuke.
Place a ladder.
Kansuke!
You're under arrest!
It's you!
Can you arrest me?
Cover the backyard!
He'll escape!
Watch the backyard!
Backyard!
Go to the backyard!
You sure the one you saw was Kansuke?
Of course.
There's no mistake.
He's so late...
Boss is home.
Boss is back.
Boss is back, everybody!
Sorry I've worried you.
The magistrate's office is guarded as if at war.
We were sure you'd be safe.
Now I feel relieved.
Where's Asa?
He's keeping guard.
Bring him.
Go back to your posts.
Boss wants to see you.
So Kansuke did that?
Is that so!
Welcome home, Boss.
Asa.
I'm through with you.
What do you mean?
Whatever it is.
You'll know if you go to Kansuke.
Please, Boss.
You do me wrong.
It's so abrupt.
I don't get it.
Boss.
Enzo.
What's this about?
It's because...
Boss has been thinking...
Endo...
You know his temperament.
He won't change his mind.
Better go back to Kansuke.
Enzo.
Gantetsu.
Tell me if you know.
Don't you know?
What?
Your uncle Kansuke was very poor.
I know.
He became a detective by the good offers of Boss Chuji's father.
Everybody knows that.
Kansuke returned that in evil.
Oh, no.
It was Kansuke who tried to arrest our Boss.
Impossible.
He can't do that!
Fool!
I did see him.
He said to Boss...
"You're under arrest."
Asa.
You make me sick.
Go down to Kansuke.
And become a detective.
I've never been away from Boss, rain or shine.
Gantetsu, please.
Ask him to forgive me.
Please Gantetsu!
Uncle is Uncle.
I'm not the same.
Let me stay.
But he was distressed.
I can't live if I'm separated from Boss.
Your uncle is vile.
Why can't they arrest Chuji?
Because he's strong.
He hasn't much to eat in the mountain.
Farmers bring rice and other things.
Why?
Because Chuji was nice to them.
Your friends were saying Chuji's a bad man.
Well, not bad, but not good.
Funny.
He's not bad, and not good?
When you grow up you will know.
A gambler is no good, however kind he may be.
Now go to bed.
I'll sing you a lullaby.
Sleep well.
It's you, Asa.
Come in.
Join me and have a drink.
Has Chuji safely returned?
Forgive me.
Asa!
You came to kill me?
Boss kicked me out.
You know why.
Wait, Asa.
Think of me.
You may kill me.
But let me say...
I hate gamblers.
I like Chuji, but not the gambler Chuji.
So you tried...
He's not one to die in his sleep.
Sooner or later he'll be crucified.
He can't retreat now.
Let him do whatever he likes.
Uncle!
No!
Hang in there!
Uncle!
Bring my head to Chuji, and tell him that I shouted about the backyard to give him a means of escape.
But he just ran.
He didn't get the idea.
What do you mean?
I...
I wanted to live with you and Kantaro.
Uncle!
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Another bowl?
No, thanks.
One bowl for each.
Give me hot water.
Gantetsu.
How many remain.
58.
Lost two more?
Don't worry about deserters.
Men are faithless.
In my day I could muster thousands of men.
Things are tough now.
Somebody's here.
Chuji.
Oh, Mayor Uemon.
Good to see you again.
What a place!
Naturally the police can't come up here.
So deep in the mountain.
Thanks.
It's the age.
Hard to breathe.
We wish we could serve you with tea or something.
I admire your perseverance.
The officials are surprised.
We're like trapped mice.
Oh, no.
The police can do nothing.
Are you here as the magistrate's envoy?
On the contrary.
I came on the behalf of the farmers.
What is it?
There'll be a revolt of farmers.
A revolt?
They want to help us?
That's right.
But it's no good.
Niemon was beaten up yesterday.
The farmers are all excited.
If they set fire to the magistrate's office they'd all be easy targets.
They'd be arrested and killed.
It'll be suicidal for them.
Then we'd rescue them.
Hold your tongue.
And?
Jubei is waiting for his chance.
This is the point of visit.
Chuji.
Will you descend the mountain?
If you will do so the farmers will be calmed.
I think it's about time for you to leave this place.
Mr. Uemon.
Is it true that the farmers are rising up for us?
How can I lie to you?
Are you sure?
Sure.
Forgive me.
I'm getting incredulous.
Can't trust and be dependent on people now.
I see what you mean.
I'll talk with Boss.
Will you come down?
For the farmers, yes.
It may be about time, as you say.
Mr. Uemon.
I'll go down right now.
At once.
Let's part here.
Thanks.
Best regards to Boss.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Be careful on the way.
You'd better not trust him.
Uemon is an old fox.
A hard customer.
I didn't believe what he said.
But our tenacity has almost come to its end.
Farmers bring us rice, but it isn't sufficient.
Under the circumstance we'd have to commit burglary.
Now, let's trust people.
We don't know if the farmers will really revolt.
But let's believe it.
I see...
You're right.
Let's go our own ways.
We may find a way out.
Asa, you're back?
Boss.
What's that?
Good boy, come with me.
Look, Boss.
It's Uncle Kansuke.
You can't kick me out now.
Now let me join you again.
Fool!
Boss.
He told me to take this head to you.
You were rash.
I sent you back because I wanted you to live with Kansuke.
I knew well that he tried to let me get away.
I could escape, thanks to him.
Asa.
You're a fool.
A fool!
Why didn't you tell me?
If I'd told you, you wouldn't have left here.
Gantetsu.
Where is he?
Here.
I've been waiting.
Cut off my head.
This foolish head.
Come on.
What's this about, Gantetsu?
I suspected Kansuke, and made Asa kill him.
Asa, quickly.
Kill me.
Idiot!
We were together for 5 years.
How could I!
Asa.
Forgive him.
I'm to blame.
I made you go down without telling the truth.
I simply wanted to make Kansuke happy.
Boss, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, Uncle.
Kansuke, what should I do?
It's all my fault.
Kansuke, forgive me.
I didn't do it right.
It's all my fault.
Please forgive me.
Asa.
Take this head to Keimeiji Temple.
Bury it with due rites.
Kansuke...
Your son will be well taken care of by me.
Fools!
Asa...
Who'll chant prayers for Kansuke?
Gantetsu.
Call everyone here.
Wait.
Who are you?
I'm Uemon.
Pass.
You're doing well.
So my lord...
I'm back, sir.
Thanks.
How was it?
You did it?
Everybody...
This is our last night here.
Your undaunted courage is deeply appreciated.
From tonight I'll be alone.
Do as you please, each of you.
You can go anywhere.
To the east or to the west.
There's a way to the north, too.
You'll go to the south, if you like.
I'm sorry I cannot give you any parting gifts.
We may meet again if we're lucky.
Now everybody.
Good bye.
Don't cry.
Good luck.
Good bye, sir.
They're all gone.
I hope they'll make it.
Boss.
Let me go with you.
Everyone has his lot.
So do I.
I'll bear it alone.
Wild geese are passing.
My treasured sword.
My life will depend on this.
Let me carry him, Enzo.
He's sound asleep.
Where is Uncle Asataro?
Kantaro I'll be your uncle from today.
I want to go back to Daddy.
Oh, sure.
Let's go now.
Where are you going to go, Boss?
Enzo.
I have someone whom I must kill.
I knew that.
I won't stop you.
Do as you please.
Toku.
Boss Chuji is coming back.
Is he?
What are these fires?
They're spirits.
Now I'll go.
Close your eyes and hold tight on my back.
One!
Two!
Three!
Hey, you!
Toku!
Thank Heaven!
Take care of him.
Matsui Jubei!
You can't get away now!
You braggart!
Let nobody in, Gantetsu!
Where is Jubei?
Now Kiku and Yosaku can rest in peace.
I will be alone again.
Good luck.
I envy Kantaro.
He's going with you.
Let's make our getaway.
Reinforcements are coming.
This is good bye.
Let's leave now.
This is my home.
I promise I'll come back.
Stay here, Toku.
Darling.
Miss!
Kantaro, which way should we go?
You decide with the hat again, right?
Oh, yeah.
You're right.
We'll decide with the hat.
Let's try.
If it turns to the face, we go right.
If it's the back, we go left.
So we go left.
Well, where does this way lead to?
THE END
Boy...
Bring us the walking stick of that blind bone-setter.
We'll pay you.
Watch out.
Silence,he will hear you.
Thanks.
GO GO!
Go away,you son of a..!
Icci!
Even you were fooled by an innocent child!
Even the teacher is weak without his sword.
CEMETARY
Drink!
What are you doing?
You were working for Naruto.
Don't you recognise us?
You are Of the Naruto family?
I am the daughter!
What do you want again?
We've paid for this month!
You haven't paid for today.
Now you're gonna pay each time we come by.
-We wont be able to survive.
-Dont protest!
Shut up and pay.
Things were really bad with the Funahatsi gang.
-Ginjo makes our life real hell!
-Damn you!
Unbelievable spectacle!
I guide a blind bone-setter who carries my vegetables.
I wish I could see that!
You did a big favour for me.
Drink some tea.
-It's hot.
-Thanks.
Without your help I couldn't bring them home.
Where are you sleeping tonight?
It's the first time you've come to this town?
You're welcome to stay.
I live alone.
Don't get any ideas.
I don't even think about it.
-Is it too strong?
-No,it's just as it should be.
I can't help but think that our town is doomed.
Ginjo and Oggi are the bosses together.
They do what want with us.
Really?
You have such punks?
They terrify the farmers and the town people.
They demand money for protection every day.
If it keeps going on like this the more we work, the poorer we'll get.
You pay for protection each day?
We didnt use to.
We were paying each month.
Big difference.
Each month, each day.
Exactly.
Are you all right;
We'll stay here for a while.
I will work again as a bodyguard.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't do that job for me.
One day I'll become a clerk again.
Stop worrying.
You need some rest.
Eh, old man!
Where is Grandfather;
He's sick today.
He won't come.
-You make him work too much.
-I'm sorry.
You must take care of him more.
The sake is awful, as always.
Can't get any better.
Same old story for 10 years!
Can you give it to that guy?
I'm not your clerk!
What nerve!
Can't you take this by yourself?
Drink at the bar!
W-w-welcome.
Leave the "welcomes".
Where is this month's money?
Please, give me some time.
What a joke!
We never wait!
I'll find the money.
Say hello to your boss.
Your sake sucks!
Shut up!
What do you want?
Send a message to your boss.
A capable ronin is looking for a job, as a bodyguard.
Samurai...
It's late.
Boss Ginjo probably won't come.
Samurai,you're the one that seeks a master to protect?
As a bodyguard?
Show me what you can do.
Well..
Not the rope.
Look at your leg.
Bone-setter, I'm off to the fields.
Tell me,lady...
Can I do something to help?
Thank you for offering your help but I can't ask a blind man to chop the wood.
Don't worry about it.
You get some rest.
My dear...
You came back late last night.
-Anything happen?
-I found a job.
As a bodyguard again?
I beg you, don't do this for me.
I beg you, stop doing this kind of work.
Don't be a fool.
With the money you may get well.
Tell me...
You hired that ronin?
Yes.
We have two problems to solve.
We must get rid of Ijutsu and Funahatsi.
After that the town will be yours, boss.
Try not to be very hard.
Yes.
Don't worry.
Do you have any news on the Heihatsi murder?
Some rumours.
It is said he was killed by a geisha.
That's all we know for now.
A bit more, bone-setter?
No thank you.
I've had enough.
Thanks again.
My lady, while I was chopping wood someone was running around the house.
Who was he?
The neighbour's son.
He's crazy with a certificate.
Don't pay any mind to him.
He imagines that he's a samurai.
He runs around like that all day.
Samurai!
So...
-I'll be out for a while.
-For work?
Not exactly.
For this.
What?
You gamble?
You should stay away from that.
My nephew is addicted to gambling.
He refuses to work, he gambles all day.
What can I say...
He's lost from the face of the earth.
For me, it's a pleasure.
Some pleasures can be very dangerous.
What do you think?
This sword cost me a fortune.
Yes, Mr. Oggi, a wonderful sword.
I will give it to Lord Sakai.
Then, he will be very pleased to work with us.
Of course.
Test it on the first beggar that comes by.
-Who?
Me?
-Yes, you!
Thank you Master, but you'd better do it.
Oh no, I'm not making my kimono dirty!
You do it!
Why don't you hire a ronin?
You fool!
Hire a ronin?
To test a sword?
-Do as I say!
-But...
Someone's coming!
Slaughter that blind man.
Do it fast!
Are you afraid of a blind man?
My... sword!
I'm sorry!
You fool!
Are we playing!
3 plus 1,even.
New game!
Any objections?
A blind man?
-Sit here, blind man.
-I am a bone-setter.
-Even.
-No more bets.
We're playing.
3 plus 2,odd.
I'm unlucky.
New game.
Any objections?
Any objections?
Odd.
-You don't bet?
-I'm just watching for now.
You're watching?
But you're blind.
1 plus 1,even.
Boss!
The bodyguard is here.
Place your bets.
Odd.
Even.
End of bets.
We're playing.
4 plus 2,even.
Any objections?
Any objections?
Them?
Yes.
Stop!
Please, don't!
It's over.
Mr.Oggi's problems are over for now.
There he is.
A bit of sake...
Old man...
May I have some sake?
Samurai...
Bone-setter...
Your walking stick!
I'm sorry.
What a lovely walking stick.
Bone-setter...
I'm not a usual bone-setter.
You stink of blood.
It's a bit uncomfortable in here.
No need to pull your sword like that.
My dear...
You had to kill again?
You fool!
It's a bit early for a fuss like that.
Go home.
The battle is over.
My bone-setter didn't come back last night.
Maybe he found a woman.
Oggi.
Sir!
I'm going to see Lord Sakai.
Hold on.
On your way back get something tasty to eat.
Thank you, sir!
Next!
Kaneko Hishiro!
Some ronin are really strong.
Hatori will face him.
You coward!
The art of battle is not the walking stick.
The real samurai uses his sword!
Are you Yamatzi Isaburo?
Yes.
Who are you?
Hatori Genosouke.
I must kill you to regain my honour.
Grab your sword!
Kill me if you want.
I never owned a sword.
Where do you find honour... ..in killing a crippled man like me?
The art of battle is not the walking stick!
A real samurai uses his sword!
He's half-dead.
No point in killing him.
Come, quickly!
Why are you in such a rush?
Shut up!
I wanted to see you.
It is better like this, isn't it?
2 plus 3, odd.
New game.
Any objections?
Place your bets.
What are you betting?
Odd.
May I join in?
Odd!
End of bets.
We're playing.
4 plus 1, odd.
Yes!
Here!
Bone-setter...
Its full of beautiful women.
You must have won.
Thanks to that bone-setter, I've won a fortune.
So, you want to pay for one night with us?
Bone-setter...
Wannna have some fun?
I'll talk to the mistress.
I'll find 5 or 6 geishas.
I'll take care of it, young master.
You stay here.
I'll go.
Ah!
It hurts!
I am not a rabbit!
Don't pull my ears!
No violence!
Don't be naughty!
That much?
Not possible!
Ah!
It hurts!
Can I stand a small needle?
No, the smaller the needle the greater the pain!
Very funny!
Come over.
-Drink something.
-Thank you.
Really funny!
Seen that, bone-setter?
Can't see much.
Osei, are you ready to dance?
Dance!
Great!
Come on, dance!
Miss Okinu why did you pull out the strings?
You want our money?
And you, Miss Osei aren't you a man?
You don't smell like a woman.
Blind men... are sensitive in these ways.
A hidden sword?
What does all this mean?
Bone-setter... you may think I am lying but I'm going to tell you the truth.
Our father was a rich man.
Come and and see Snowy.
Don't tell anyone.
Heihatsi...
You pulled through for 7 years.
Heihatsi, where are they hidden?
-Here.
-How many are they?
The Narutos, both their children 3 maids, and 4 man servants.
Tasitsi, what have you found?
8 safes full of money.
They've gathered a fortune!
Inosuke, we're rich for the rest of our lives!
Call boss Kutsinawa.
You killed them all?
The kids?
We didn't find them anywhere.
You fools!
We don't have time.
Let's go.
We hunted down Heihatsi, the servant.
What are you doing?
You were working for Naruto.
Don't you recognise us?
You are of the Naruto family?
I am the daughter!
As far as the others concerned, I only know their names.
Tell me their names.
Inosuke and Tasitsi.
They also mentioned the boss Kutsinawa.
That's all we know.
And all these years you've been searching?
Even.
Wrong again!
I'll try with my eyes closed.
Like him.
How does he do that by only hearing?
I am so unlucky!
One got away!
That's the problem.
Odd.
Even.
I think I got it!
My senses work better with my eyes closed.
Good!
Sinkitsi!
You're sitting with your eyes closed.
Won't you bet?
I'm listening.
To what;
You're sitting here and listening?
I have the right to listen.
You're asking for it.
Don't play tough with me!
This dump needs customers.
You bastard!
Take it easy, Sinkitsi!
You can listen and bet.
You're calling me by my first name?
You shouldn't be talking to a customer like that!
Customer?
You used to work for me.
Shut up and bet!
Too bad for you.
The last sound was...
OK.
Odd!
Odd.
We're playing.
4 plus 2,even!
So?
I have a message for your boss.
What?
Go to hell!
-Is miss Ijutsu here?
-One moment please.
May I ask what are you are looking for here?
Your late husband owes money from gambling.
I am taking your store.
You've got 3 days to go.
Not a day more.
-This is madness!
-Shut up!
Don't get involved in our business!
You see those dolls?
-You know them?
-No.
I wish I knew them!
The one in red is hot.
Some more sake, please.
Osei...
Should we ask for a job?
Sir...
You know if we can offer our services anywhere?
We don't have jobs.
-Do you know anyone?
You can try Mr. Oggi.
He's in charge now, thanks to Ginjo.
That Mr.Oggi...
Can you introduce us to him?
Old man, help the ladies.
Grandfather, go find Oggi.
Go yourself, you bastard!
Don't take advantage of the old man!
Fast!
I present you the windmill!
Look how it spins.
Boss!
The tavern owner introduces you to two geishas.
They are free tonight.
Great.
Send them in.
You two, go away!
Lord Sakai, in a while we will have two lovely geishas for company.
Fast.
What are we playing?
Even.
Even!
End of bets.
We're playing.
5 plus 3,even.
I won!
Oggi!
Do I have to watch this for a long time?
Lets see some dancing.
The show is over.
Go away!
Time to dance, ladies.
Quickly!
Dance!
Odd.
End of bets.
We're playing.
4 plus 1,odd.
Bone-setter, should we bet everything?
New game.
Any objections?
Eh!
The dice don't sound the same.
You damn bone-setter!
I'll...
Master.
A bone-setter has turned the club upside-down.
Boss wants you to go.
A bone-setter?
Please, sir.
Let's go.
Leave me.
Come on.
Do as he says!
Don't touch me!
Are you ok?
Be careful where you step.
Watch out!
What are you looking at?
Bone-setter...
Wait here.
I'll go see what's happening.
Ah!
Girls, this way!
Quickly!
That Oggi guy is horrible!
I hit him and we left when the other man went to take Osei.
We had troubles in Ginjo store.
But the bone-setter laid everyone to the ground.
It was unbelievable.
Who are you anyway?
If we stay here,they'll find us shortly.
Lets go to my aunt's.
Not possible.
Ginjo's men are all over the place.
That's true.
I have an idea.
Okinu, do you have any make-up?
Of course.
Bone-setter, come here.
Don't move.
-What is it?
-I'm going to paint some eyes.
For me?
Open!
Who is it at this hour?
-Who is it?
-Your nephew, Sinkitsi.
He probably lost everything again.
Come in.
Who are these people?
Watch out, bone-setter.
-Bone-setter!
-Yes, its me.
You are useless!
What happened to the bodyguard?
Everything was over when he came.
The bone-setter was already gone.
Who is that bone-setter?
Don't really know.
A bone-setter.
That punk Sinkitsi was with him.
He often goes the club.
It won't be hard to track him down.
We'll get the bone-setter too.
Firstly we must make the Funahatsi gang extinct.
How horrible...
We were suddenly going from town to town.
Cheating men and robbing them.
Ten years?
These killers must live somewhere else now.
Hold on.
Wasn't Oggi here ten years ago?
Right.
Yes, that Oggi...
Something's strange about him.
I saw his arm.
He has a snake tattoo.
One moment...
The names you just said...
You mentioned someone named Kutsinawa?
Yes,right.
Kutsinawa means "rotten rope".
Maybe it means snake.
Right;
Bone setter!
Don't look me with these eyes!
I heard about last night.
A bone-setter ruined your store.
Yes.
We ran over there with the bodyguard.
But we were late.
Oggi...
How were those ladies?
Lord Sakai tried to take one.
But the other one hit me hard.
The way I saw them acting I am sure they are not real geishas.
Listen...
Learn anything you can about that bone-setter and those geishas.
We're playing.
Even.
Odd.
I won.
This is my home.
Go!
Go away!
You're still eating?
I told you to clean up!
Young Seitaro, master wants to see you.
You, clean up this mess!
Come with me, Seitaro.
You are so lovely!
from now on you will be my girl.
If you do what I say you and your sister are welcome to live here.
You want to live here?
I'll buy you some beautiful kimonos.
What are you doing there?
Stay away from the master's room!
No!
Sir...
You want to spend some time with me?
Osei...
Time for practise.
Sister...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you ok?
Aunt, do you have an umbrela?
Over there.
I'm going to see what's happening downtown.
Thank you.
Grandfather, where is the old man today?
He had something to take care of.
That dull man?
Why are you working in this dump?
Don't have any family?
Exactly.
He picked me off the streets and offered my a job.
I was treated well.
I'm thankful for what he has done for me.
Begging is better than working here!
If you sit outside on the ground, you'll earn more for sure.
5 plus 1,even.
New game.
Any ojections?
What are you doing here, bastards?
Pay, if you want to play.
Watch out.
We were here first.
You're looking for trouble,bastard?
You're looking for trouble?
Ginjo wants to compete.
Stay back.
Oh my God!
Hold on...
It's over.
That bone-setter...
Do you think he's Zatoichi?
And the geishas... ..must be from the Naruto family.
The Naruto killings...
When did it happen?
Ten years ago.
I see.
If the kids survived, they must be grownups now.
I wonder...
That bodyguard...
' ' ' ...is he capable of beating Zatoichi?
Where is Oggi?
Boss Ginjo himself!
I'm glad you came!
This way please.
I've heard your business goes well.
-I told you not to come here.
-Don't worry.
The Funahatsis are gone.
We're in charge now.
The only thing left is to make our pockets full.
Clean up in here!
Great news!
Funahatsi gang is exterminated.
Ginjo gang and the bodyguard slaughtered them all.
That Ginjo guy hired a tremendous bodyguard!
Bone-setter,you better not go to the town.
Sinkitsi, is that bodyguard really so strong?
He's unbelievable.
If we had to face each other at night, who would be the winner?
If it was so dark, no one would see a thing...
The winner would probably be you.
You think it's funny?
Let's see you now.
I'll train you.
Come!
I'teach you the art of battle.
Concentrate.
We start.
Attack from all sides.
Not all at the same time!
Let's try again.
For safety, let's plan the moves.
Listen to me.
Me first...
Like that...
You hit here.
Then you!
And then,you.
Good.
Let's try.
You see?
You see what you can do?
Faster now.
Good.
That's it!
Not like that!
It hurts, you fool!
End of lesson.
You jerks!
What are you doing
You fool!
Go home!
-I'll have a bath.
-Me too.
No!
Men first.
I'm a man myself!
Bone-setter...
I'm thinking of paying a visit to Oggi again.
I have to know if he was one of the thieves.
The water is cold.
Make it hotter!
Don't get on my nerves!
Isn't it too much already, you bathing yourself in broad daylight!
You're useless!
It isn't good cold.
Please, heat it a bit more.
That's what I'm doing!
I confess it's unbelievable.
You really look like a woman.
Make-up makes men more beautiful?
Not all men.
It all depends on your face.
Welcome.
We want to apologize to Mr.Oggi.
He paid us to dance for him and we treated him disrespectfully.
Really?
Can you tell him we said we were sorry?
Sit down.
Oggi drinks too much.He probably has already forgotten about it.
-Don't you worry.
-I hope you're right.
We haven't see you lately.
-Where do you live?
-At Ms.Ume's house.
Is there a bone-setter living with you?
Are you alright, grandfather?
Throw 'em out.
Drink something.
Thank you.
Oggi and Ginjo are friends now.
They are working together.
But their job has nothing to do with you.
One more?
Not yet.
I'm off to Oggi's.
I'll be late.
You wait here.
Oggi says he's not angry at all.
He likes you and wants to see you both.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for the sake.
Good luck.
Where are the others?
They're off to the city.
What are you doing over there?
Are you mad?
I want to be beautiful, like Osei.
What are you craving for!
What's all this fuss?
You're back, silly kid?
-Where is the bone-setter?
-Who are you?
We want the bone-setter.
-He's not here.
-You cannot hide him from us.
But he's not here.
We'll burn down the house and smoke him out.
Burn it!
Stop!
Aunt Ume!
We're in trouble!
The house is on fire!
Wake up!
We're in trouble!
Come on!
Quickly!
Who are these people?
Sinkitsi!
Damn!
Very beautiful woman.
Woman?
Things are not always as they seem, Inosouke.
Don't use that old name.
The walls have ears here.
My name now is Ginjo.
What are you looking at?
Keep dancing.
We know it all.
You're Naruto's kids.
-Bone-setter!
-Girls, go now.
Call the bodyguard.
Inosouke, where are you going?
-Where is the bodyguard?
-At his home.
Call him now!
Give me the sword!
On top of mama-turtle goes the baby-turtle.
On top of baby-turtle goes the baby-baby-turtle.
On top of baby-turtle goes the baby-baby-baby-turtle.
Mama-turtle goes down baby-turtle goes down, baby-baby-turtle goes down, baby-baby-baby-turtle goes down too.
All the thieves are dead.
Except boss Kutsinawa.
He must be really old now.
He'll be dead soon anyway.
Don't think about him.
You'd better think about your future.
You can stay here.
You can become a man again.
I'm fine as I am now.
Where is the bone setter?
He must be around somewhere.
But the festival starts today.
You found me.
How did you know?
Bastard.
You can change as much as you want that awful smell will always stay the same.
Stop bullshitting, blind man!
I proudly accept that I am boss Kutsinawa.
A blind man like yourself Will not slaughter me easily!
What the hell!
You're not blind?
-Not at all.
-Then why do you pretend to be blind?
Because blind men can sense the world better.
I knew you could see!
I knew it from the first time you came here.
You killed my men.
And Torakitsi
You killed the tavern man... he was a kid from the streets.
I picked him up many years ago.
I taught him the business so he could be my successor.
All my gang is gone all from a wandering bone-setter.
How did you know that I was the real boss Kutsinawa;
From the time you threw my walking stick to see the sword.
You're the worst gangster of all.
Really;
I'm like a cripple now.
The time of my retirement has arrived.
But I lived a full life.
I regret nothing.
Come on, kill me!
You don't deserve to die.
Finish your life as blind man!
Even with my eyes wide open I can't see anything!
Alfredo!
Alfredo?
!
Alfredo?
He's coming right now!
Alfredo?
Alfredo, it's Morretti.
I fixed you some lentils.
Eat them after midnight, they bring good luck.
There's some wine and an orange.
It's small but very sweet.
How do you feel?
- I don't know.
Daddy, shall we break the piggy bank?
You break it at midnight.
As soon as the year ends.
No, we'll be sleeping.
Why?
Celebrate the New Year without me.
Bye.
Alfredo, your bag.
No, we're not celebrating anything without you.
At that time you'll be underground,...
I mean, in the subway.
We'll have some broth and then we'll all go to bed... right, children?
We'll celebrate tomorrow with you.
Good night Alfredo.
Bye.
- And happy New Year.
Happy ending...
Mother, take the meat off the fire!
Assuntine, go down the cafe and telephone... uncle Francesco, uncle Pasquale and aunt Cesira.
Tell them we're expecting them, and to bring the eel, and plenty.
You break the piggy bank so we can play bingo.
It smells so good!
Delicious!
- Poor Alfredo!
Well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Better!
Colombini, did you take a count?
- What count?
I thought about it at the bus stop.
How many are we for dinner?
Well, easy to say.
Myself... 13!
Right!
A New Year's eve dinner with 13.
"I'll take care of it.
I'll organise it."
An idiot like you can't organise!
Well, I made a mistake.
Even priests make mistakes, no?
- So?
What do we do?
We'll fix things up somehow, and find a good soul to be the 14th.
So late?
It's after 8 o'clock you know?
Let's bring Pannocchia.
Give it a try.
- He's so ugly!
Will you come to dinner?
- No!
Why not to dinner with us?
I already have an invitation!
Take that!
Listen to that!
Who invited you?
That's my business, OK?
It's not okay!
Well then... work!
It's 8.00, almost 8.05, so I'm leaving!
I don't have time to waste.
Goodbye.
He's funny, he makes me laugh.
What now?
I have an idea...
Let's call Tortorella.
Who's that?
Tortorella!
Gioia...
She's always alert, always available.
I'll call Mimi.
She sees her at Cinecitta.
Tell her to bring her share, cause I'm not paying for anyone, huh?
Miracle, miracle!
Pediconi!
Take out the 3rd from the left!
Does he look like he's had a miracle?
Me?
- Yes, you!
The director is right.
This is a mystic scene.
He's even cautioned, boss!
Tortorella, speak for yourself, or I'll slug you in the face!
Come on, be quiet!
Tortorella is right.
Sure, she's always right!
And you all, do like she does...
she's gives her whole self.
Ready!
That man has to stop moving his hands.
Let's hurry.
After this scene we'll all go home to celebrate.
Ready then?
Look out for the watches.
Ready?
Pediconi, good boy, go take St Zeno's place.
Damn him!
Action!
Look at me, I'm St Zeno.
The lions don't tear me apart.
They're moving back.
Miracle!
Miracle, miracle!
Stop.
Okay, that's enough.
See you tomorrow!
Goodnight everyone.
Happy New Year!
Stop!
Keep quiet!
I didn't put the sandals on.
Here's the tunic.
Gimme a hand!
- Here!
Are you in a hurry?
- I'll miss my bus.
Darn it!
I've put on weight.
- I think so!
What are you doing tonight?
- What I'm doing?
I have an invitation from whatshisname...
Then maybe something else too.
I have yet to decide.
You're still with that accountant?
Who?
Capecchi?
It's over, he wasn't my type.
His wife caught him and beat him up!
Say, why did you ask me what I am doing tonight?
Well, just so...
- Why?
Say!
I wanted to ask you to come with us.
Who's "us"?
A nice group of people.
But if you're busy...
I'll cancel, ok?
Have you got a nice dress?
- I've bought an evening gown... for the inaugration of the film "Night at the Grand Hotel".
What are you wearing on top?
You can't imagine what foxes!
OK then.
Let's meet at 10 at the Esedra fountain.
Look at what condition my fur is in!
At 10?
- Yes, 10.
Look, between one thing and another it's 8,000 lira per person.
These are sophisticated people.
I have an idea for tonight...
- Say, say!
I want to have my hair....
no, I won't tell you.
New Year, new life!
Good!
Maybe tonight you'll find the right man.
I wish the right angel would come by and say "Amen"!
I'm going.
The "Nuns of Monza" are coming.
I'm late!
Bye!
10 at Piazza Esedra.
Alright!
Hi there!
Hi Spizzico.
You're punctual.
Spizzico is always punctual.
The agreement is clear.
Gold and jewels.
Stuff that can be melted.
No voluminous stuff, I won't take it.
I don't go to ballrooms for mattresses and blankets!
Small size stuff, don't worry.
His work is high class.
Do you have a cigarette?
Give him a cigarette.
Come on.
How do you pay?
Well!
Tell him, what did you bring last time?
Diamonds so big they looked like peach kernels.
Paid how?
Like peach kernels!
Pecori', we're talking business.
So don't play the fool!
Never mind!
Did you find me a helper?
Spizzico asked me, but I can't tonight.
I'm having dinner with my sick father.
How's he going to eat if he's sick!
Does he have tapeworm?
It's not easy, you know?
You even want someone in a blue suit.
I spread the word.
There aren't many people suited for high class places.
And those few don't trust you.
They don't know you.
I've been away.
- Or inside?
They told you not to play the fool!
I've been abroad 3 years.
We know it.
You're smart!
The idea of making the rounds of the nightclubs is a good idea.
Excellent, indeed!
Why don't you go alone?
- I pick up and pass on.
I don't keep the stuff on me.
It's a nervous thing.
If I don't pass it on immediately, I'm sunk.
Want a good looking guy?
Clean record, in a tailcoat?
Umberto Pennazzuto.
- Who? "Accident?"
Why not?
Why not?
"Accident"?
Who is that?
A guy who's an extra in Cinecittà.
And every time he has an accident, just to get medical insurance.
Then, he's a beggar.
Who did you want as assistant, Dante Alighieri?
Well?
Gotta clear the room!
Dancing, tonight!
You won't protest, with 3 months rent late, right?
Pennazzuto, telephone.
- There he is!
- Coming!
Hello?
Spizzico who?
Oh yes.
Hi.
Of course I have a dinner jacket.
What sort of work is it?
And you call that work?
!
I know, but it's not for me.
It's not that I'm afraid...
It's just not my kind of work.
Besides, I'm busy.
Yes, a lady.
All considered, it's not worth it.
Sorry.
If I change my mind, I'll call.
Happy New Year.
Goodbye.
Well, well!
You're even refusing work now?
30 lire!
I am the big director Cecil B. Demille.
I want to speak to the famous actress Tortorella.
Umberto, stop it, Cecil B DeMille is even dead.
You recognised me, huh?
But you almost fell for it, no?
Yeah, OK.
I had a great idea!
Shall we spend the evening together?
Hello?
Tortorella are you there?
I mean, are you there?
I was saying,..
shall we spend New Year's together, like last year?
It brings us luck!
Good luck?
I've never seen a year like this one.
Thinking it over, maybe it was you who gave the jinx!
Don't get angry.
Anyway, I'm busy.
Yes, I'm going out with friends.
Couldn't I come too?
I don't know... yes... maybe.
I'm warning you, it's 8,000 lire per person.
Are you there?
Well, goodnight, and happy New Year.
Night.
He even made me get cold.
30 lire.
Tortorella, get me the hot water bottle.
You're leaving me all alone.
- Be patient.
Patient what?
Look what you're doing!
Grandpa it's late!
I just need the hairdryer.
Watch out for the casserole.
Oh, my lentils!
Don't get angry.
- Sure, I'm angry!
Darn that Umberto, he made me late!
What Umberto!
Darn you!
- Darn him!
You'd better leave!
Go on, go dancing and leave me alone!
Damn, how hot!
It runs on normal or industrial current?
What happened Tortorella?
It's OK now!
Hey, did the valves go off?
What do we do now?
- Grandpa!
The valves went off, see?
I can't see a thing!
We've got to fix them.
I'm not moving from here.
I don't have my slippers.
How, you're not moving!
Don't make a fuss.
Come on, it's late, i'll take you.
No, don't hit me!
Be good!
I'm strong, hold onto me.
Hold onto me!
Boy you're heavy!
Are you crazy?
- Are you nuts?
Want to kill us on New Year's?
You're even being humourous!
- What's up?
- We are 13!
Tortorella said she was coming.
- Yes, but Amapola is not.
She got an infection from an injection.
That big!
- Got that?
Dumb of me to trust you!
You shouldn't have invited Tortorella.
Dumb alright!
What you saying?
If you didn't bug me we were 13 I wouldn't have called her.
Tortorella is staying home.
Mimì, go call her.
Are you crazy?
Now?
You could've thought of it before.
Why, what time is it?
It's almost 10.05.
- 10.05?
So, it's past 10.
You know what's new?
Let's hurry!
Goodnight.
This isn't the Trevi fountain, you know?
Where is Trevi fountain?
Darn it!
How do you say...?
Damn bitch!
- Hey!
That's not very nice!
Damn b... now I'm saying it!
Maybe I'm at the wrong fountain too.
Good evening, sorry about the delay.
Excuse me, are you Lello?
What are you wearing?
Why?
- You're asking why?
Of course I say why!
When Spizzico called me, he said to wear a dinner jacket.
And what's this?
You look like a waiter!
- Oh no, dear friend!
At a grand evening, a real gentleman wears a tuxedo if he wants to be noticed.
That's how it is, my friend!
Aside from the fact that you should go unnoticed, almost invisible,..
does a real gentleman go out without a coat?
I have one, but it's brown, and it clashes with my tuxedo.
This way I look like a gentleman that's just gotten out of his car.
Let me tell you.
I am an authority on men's elegance!
Do you know what to do?
- More or less.
You must stay near me, but without showing that we know each other.
I must put what I pick into your pocket.
But how can I if you don't have one?
- It's alringt!
I have a secret pocket!
I used this tuxedo when I worked with the magician Castelli.
Look at me.
So, I'll leave the night club and wait for you outside.
Right?
No, it's not right!
Go to the bathroom and hide the objects in the flush tank.
Clear?
Then come back to me.
The ticket.
- You took care of everything!
I'm going ahead.
Come in in 5 minutes and stay by the 3rd pillar.
What pillar?
- 3rd pillar to the right, got it?
Stay there until I signal you.
In 5 minutes.
You got a watch?
- No.
- Then count to 500.
What manners!
Umberto!
Umberto!
Go on there.
It's Tortorella.
Tortorella?
Are you blonde?
Looks good, huh?
- How pretty!
You know who you look like?
Kim Novak.
- And you look like a crow, instead.
...58, 59, 60...
- What are you doing?
I was saying...you're blonde!
- You already said that.
Are you going with your friends?
Yes... no, because of you!
- Because of me?
Your phone call delayed me so much... and I was late to the meeting point.
Happy now?
I went to the Hungarian restaurant, but they weren't there either.
I'm glad!
Why, are...
are you alone too?
Yes.
Then let's go have a good time together.
I could slap myself in the face.
I'd break my head!
I could punch myself in the eye.
- Why?
I was born with the jinx!
- I know this!
How?
You're free, and I'm...
I shouldn't tell you...
I have an engagement here.
Who with?
With a "femme"?
- More or less.
And you would kick yourself for that?
If you care to be with me, let's go in anyway, and when comes..
the lady,..
we'll take turns dancing with you.
Come on, hurry!
- No!
Listen!
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's have a pizza, huh?
I'm not even supposed to see her?
What a gem she must be!
I won't throw a jealous fit.
She can't be worse than what I imagine!
Let's go inside and I'll leave you alone when I see all my friends.
I want to have a good time tonight.
- Lady!
What about me?
Pay the taxi!
Who, me?
- Yes you!
How much?
- 1.000.
Hurry.
It's all the cold I caught at the fountain.
Look for a table.
- Unfortunately I can't move from this pillar.
Are you crazy?
- I may be, but I cannot move from here.
Look for a table.
When your girlfriend comes, you get up and call her.
I can't.
The date is here.
We're not going to stand here like two idiots.
Come on!
Then, you look for the table!
How rude!
You're sending a lady to look for it?
Move!
No, I can't.
- Umberto, we're amidst the crowd.
Come on, move.
Alright, I'll go, but don't move from here.
Don't move from here, and hold the pillar.
Otherwise someone might take it away!
What a character.
Ladies and gentlemen, please!
Some silence!
We continue the lottery.
Please, some silence!
In the interest of all!
Silence, please.
We will continure our lottery.
For people who have just arrived, we repeat that..
the numbers drawn correspond to the numbers on the entrance tickets.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Did someone come for me?
- No, not even the mail.
But someone arrived for me.
If you're not careful, they'll kidnap me.
Did you find a table?
- No, everything's taken.
Because you're a ham!
You want to bet I'll find one?
Then find one!
Listen, if you want to get rid of me just say so.
I didn't look for you.
I can find plenty of men...
There's one that's been staring at me for half an hour.
He's young and handsome.
You boor!
The lovely Miss Ruoppolo,..
daughter of our member, Mr Eugenio,..
is about to draw the number for the lucky winner of the 3rd prize!
...and Mrs. Trotta: why, do you want it?
We've got to tell that to Di Nepi!
Where did he go?
So, the first number drawn,..
will be entitled to the third prize.
The second number to the second prize, and so on.
Is it clear?
Is it clear to all?
Pardon me, I'd like to take a look.
Pardon me.
Just one moment.
No, I can't see him.
Where is he?
Di Nepi?
The number is... 61!
Where is De Nepi?
Find him.
Please check your entrance ticket!
I repeat: 61!
I got it!
Umberto, we have the 61!
Here it is!
The 61!
You win a 70% discount coupon for..
the Notargiacomo leather store.
Please gentlemen, come up here.
And a bottle of champagne of the "Tiraboschi" company... courtesy of Mr Vincenzo Tiraboschi.
A big round of applause for Mr Vincenzo Tiraboschi.
The lucky winners are none other than Mr Mrs...?
Umberto Pennazzuto and Gioia Fabbricotti.
I'm Pennazzuto and she's Fabbricotti.
In the commerce business?
- No, actors.
Actors?
How come we didn't know?
Then you're guests of honour.
Cinema or theatre actors?
- Cinema, theatre, variety, everything.
Soon we'll be on television.
Don't think you're getting away with just that.
No, we get away with just that.
A little song or maybe a duet?
We can't miss such an opportunity, can we?
Ok, thank you.
Silence please.
Mr Buzzicotto and Mrs Fabbricotti...
Miss, please.
Miss Fabbricotti will now perform...?
We'll decide on it now.
Excuse me, we must talk it over.
There he is!
Di Nepi, come here!
At last!
Listen to this one, it's hilarious...
May I use this little hat?
Ready, maestro?
My pin!
Oh God, where is my pin?
!
Out with the pin, no tricks.
But this is crazy!
- Can't anything be done...?
Lady, here it is.
It was near the plant.
Silence please, gentlemen.
- Gentlemen, we are artists!
There's a lady, it's not nice!
Please, maestro.
Geppina, smoky girl,
Has a head with a turned up nose,
Her love is called nobody,
And she often goes around in a tutu.
Geppina acts like the sun at night, and during the day she paints it blue
Geppina, the more she lives and the more she dies,
You see her... and then no more!
Geppina, Gepi, your voice.
Geppina, Gepi, your light.
You are so strange but, I like you.
I like you, I like you, the way you are.
I want you.
Only you.
Only you.
Oh God, he's here!
Here's to you, with all our compliments and best wishes.
Listen, since you are so kind, could you find us a table?
Don't have a table?
- No.
- We arrange immediately!
Thank you, you're very kind.
- Waiter!
A table for the lady and gentleman...
and top service!
For two?
- Thank you!
You're hurting me.
- If you don't obey me I'll really hurt you.
I couldn't leave the lady alone.
She's a colleague.
Go put it in the toilet right away.
- Yessir,..
but what?
What I put in your tux!
Umberto!
We're invited.
We have...
- Where is it?
We have a table!
You lost something?
- No, nothing...
- What happened?
I know what happened, but some day you'll know too.
Let's go.
Are you crazy?
We've got a table now.
- Listen to me, let's go.
Listen, don't be a boor.
Don't ruin my evening.
The waiter is coming.
Are you having dinner?
- No.
- Yes.
Yes.
- We dine, yes.
We do.
10,000.
- What?
- 5,000 lire per person, a la carte.
It wasn't an invitation then.
Oh, we...
Wait a minute.
Excuse us, huh?
Don't you have the 10,000?
- No.
I paid the taxi.
- What a bum you are!
You've ruined my evening.
Jerk!
I'm truly sorry, but the gentleman was just reminding me that..
we have another invitation I'd forgotten about.
- It happens.
Some other time.
Please be so kind as to..
give my thanks to the organisers, and...it's too bad!
Thank you!
- Goodbye.
How can you embarass me like that?
Take off that hat!
Are we going?
Walk!
What manners!
Don't touch me!
The raincoat please.
Number 94.
What did you say?
- 94.
94!
You don't even have 10,000 lousy lire on New Year's Eve?
Now tell me where we will spend midnight, alone in the street.
Tell me.
You even do the gentleman, inviting people!
I was an idiot to fall for it.
I could have stayed there, I'd already found company.
What gentleman?
You're a real party pooper.
Everything goes wrong with you!
It's damn cold, too!
So the lack of money is a fault?
You must blame society, not me!
The society of dogcatchers, that didn't catch you yet!
Your hand off, or I'll chop it!
- Listen, if I didn't know you, I'd be offended!
Well, you don't know me!
Go ahead and be offended, once for all!
You're always nervous!
- Leave me alone!
Come on, let's make peace.
I'll treat you a nice pizza!
You got the money?
What?
- Do you have money?
Listen, I've got to tell you something Umberto.
I'm really fed up!
I've been offering you pizzas and cappucchino for 20 years!
What law says I have to do that?
The law of gratitude.
- What gratitude?
- I launched your acting career.
You launched me?
Go to...
I'd better keep quiet!
Look who's here!
Umberto, Colombini!
Look who's there!
Hey, you fools!
Come on, we'll have a great New Year's.
Good evening.
Good evening everyone!
Didn't you tell me 'at the Esedra fountain'?
There's company!
Whew, we're 14!
- Tortorella, bring your friend too.
May I?
Come on!
- Me?
Mimi, you know him, introduce him.
Gentlemen, Umberto Pennazzuto.
- Pleased.
We're all friends here!
Good evening everybody!
- Ladies head of the table!
- Thank you so much.
Well guys, why don't you tell me what happened?
I waited an hour!
- How's that possible?
So did we!
- And how!
At piazza Esedra?
- No!
No.
Not exactly at piazza Esedra.
We had said at the entrance, in front of the church.
- There!
No, sorry.
Mimi said in front of the fountain.
Well, church, fountain...
- And then, I was there too, but you were not!
I looked all over for you.
At the Hungarian restaurant, at the Grand Hotel...
Well, all's well that ends well.
Okay fettuccine for you?
- Sure!
- Two fettuccine, abundant!
Today has been really rewarding, I'm really happy.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
The director complimented me in front of everyone,..
for the miracle scene.
A very difficult scene.
All inner sufferings,..
with moving words, "Miracle, miracle!".
And then, our eyes were supposed to cry out.
Eyes cry out?
Yes, in short, to have in your eyes a light...a speaking light, there!
They didn't notice the hair.
- Right, it's true!
Hey, haven't you noticed anything strange about me?
I'm blonde, no?
True!
We didn't notice!
How is it?
I look good, no?
You're a darling!
There he is again!
-Who?
- Don't look back!
Don't look now, but up at the window,..
there's a young man who's been following me all night.
He's cute, uh?
Umberto!
Don't look back now.
Behind there's a young man who was staring at me at Milleluci.
You expect me to invite him in?
You saw?
Tortorella, I've thought it over...
There's that woman outside that was looking for me.
I need to go and talk to her.
It's not nice on my side.
What?
- I have to go.
You don't need me, you got company now.
As you wish, you're free.
Ladies, excuse me.
Happy New Year.
Where are you going?
- Are you leaving?
No, you can't go!
What you doing?
You're tearing my tail!
You're not moving from here.
Go to your place!
Why?
- Cant't you see we're 13?
!
That's why you dumped me at piazza Esedra!
Tortorella, don't be such a bore!
- Oh, even?
Umberto...
Umberto, slap him and tell them they are rude and ignorant.
At this hour?
- Don't do such a fuss now!
Ah, no fuss, huh?
Ignorant boors, that's what you are!
Who cares about you?
Who asked you anything?
It was this nitwit who begged me to come.
And for only thanks, you leave me in the street!
Look, you!
You'll be a nitwit!
Hey, big horse, you'd better get lower!
If you fall you strike oil!
Out with the cigarette case!
Don't get smart with me!
Where did you put it?
I don't have it, it dropped.
- I could break your arm, you know?
- I know!
Don't be a villain.
I'm in a delicate situation.
I'm with a respectable lady.
Listen!
Spizzico would've given me 10,000 lire!
Now you owe me!
- Alright!
As soon as I find 10,000 it'll be my care!
And don't push!
- Walk!
- Who?
!
I'm through, my dear friend.
I've had enough fun tonight.
I didn't even have dinner!
I can't replace you at this time at night, and I need a support.
So hurry up, and don't drag your feet!
- Even!
- And tuck your shirt in.
Move!
Young men!
Umberto!
- Who's that?
- What, you leave me alone?
Allow me,..
Miss Gioia Fabbricotti, Mr Lello, an acquaintance.
Pleased to meet you.
And you, did you leave those people?
- Of course, they're so rude.
I have never been treated so badly.
Tortorella, why do you get angry?
They're the ones that should be ashamed.
They're not worthy to kiss the ground you walk on, I tell you!
You're right.
And then your friend isn't interested in this.
What are you doing, taking a walk?
I was passing by and we met.
Oh, passing by?
Always passing by, your friend.
- So, what shall we do?
Right.
We're not going to spend midnight out in the cold, are we?
What's on the gentleman's mind?
- Well, since I met him, I'll go along with him.
Well, he's with me, so we'll all go together, no?
How nice!
- Tortorella, it's not...
- Do you like to dance?
Tortorella, it's not the case!
- Umberto...
Umberto, be good.
There are 4 cardinal points, you pick one and go that way.
Go look for that girlfriend of yours, she's been waiting all night.
How boring!
We're going by ourselves.
The two of us, poor derelicts!
Got an idea!
Why don't we go to EUR?
Wonderful!
They say that last year there were 3 orchestras.
Yes!
- Let's go Umberto.
Come on!
Just to dance?
- Let's take the subway, 3 stops and we're there.
Hurry, or midnight will catch us in the street!
Get the tickets.
- I've got no change!
- Each his own.
- I won't permit it.
It took New Year's Eve to see the subway.
You know, I'd never seen it before.
What Romans we are!
Will you tell me why you left Milleluci?
- What do you think?
Crazy!
Sit down, lady.
Sit down.
Stop, stop!
It was you, huh?
You did it on purpose!
Ugly coward!
I've got to get 50,000 lire by tomorrow.
Come on, let's go!
Don't push me.
- Go on!
Hurry up or you'll be spending New Year's in a hospital bed.
I'm here!
Quiet!
I'm here, huh?
I'm here!
No, I don't get off here!
I continue.
I go on!
Mr Lello...
Mr Lello?
Open this door, will you?
I say, will you stop, please?
Stop!
Is it so hard to do?
We can't.
- Why?
- Did you miss your stop?
I lost my friends, they couldn't get on with that crowd.
Stop, will you?
I heard two mean yelling.
Oh yes?
Did you see?
Excuse me, where do you have to go?
- To EUR.
But this train doesn't go to EUR!
We all made mistakes tonight.
Poor things!
They surely realised that this was the wrong train.
You could've told me they were calling me, no?
But, how could I know they were with you?
Excuse me, I don't want to meddle..
but if they had to go to EUR,..
the lady can get the train going in the opposite direction.
Right?
- No, wrong.
Because this is the last run, and the train goes straight to the depot.
What bad luck tonight.
Everything's gone wrong.
Everything's gone wrong.
Excuse me, but can't you stop?
Be kind, no?
It's not a matter of kindness.
It's that we're underground!
I understand...we're like weasels.
My lady, that's how we're going to end up!
Well!
At least we'll be among happy people!
Are they crazy?
- That's the custom.
On New Year's Eve, out the window old things must leave!
Under here, quick!
Damn them!
How shameful!
What do the police do?
!
This is because we hurt Tortorella.
- She's probably better off than us.
She's certainly found good company, and is having fun.
Cheer up madam.
Look at us!
Happy New Year to you too, my friend.
Let's kiss.
Look where I ended up!
Excuse me.
Would you like some lentils, Madam?
No, thanks.
- Try them, my wife made them.
Yes, but I have an upset stomach.
- They are really good, with celery, onion...
Thank you, but I really can't.
Not even a taste?
- No, thank you.
Look where I had to finish the year!
It's crazy!
Listen, lady.
- Yeah...
I wanted to tell you that at the depot, I have a friend who's a biker.
He lives at the EUR.
If I ask him, he'll take you there in 10 minutes.
Because, if you look for a taxi, it'll take you at least an hour.
At least!
You are very kind!
Really kind!
And, tell me, how long will it take before we get to the depot?
We're already there!
Damn it!
Come on, it stopped raining.
It rains again.
What's he doing now?
What's he doing?
When are you arriving, for Easter?
What's he saying?
- Dunno!
Sure buddy!
He wants us to move the rubbish with the steamroller.
Easier said!
The machine is not ours.
Of course, of course.
It doesn't matter, we'll be glad to help you anyway.
Right Umberto?
- Are you nuts?
- We'll swipe the bundle.
We'll clean everything!
Lots of work!
Let's take off our jackets, huh?
Are you mad?
Take off your jacket, so he'll do the same.
Take off your jacket.
You, no take off ... jacket?
We...take off...jacket.
When we put on the clothes, you make him talk, and I'll slip off his...
Stop!
- My jacket!
- Thief!
Bastard!
My jacket!
He's an international thief!
Did you see what happened?
- What, now it's my fault?
I knew it!
I'll catch pneumonia.
- What are you doing?
- I'm warming up.
Wait, there's more.
Here he is!
May you get a stroke!
- Come on, amigos!
Everyone to the EUR !
Are you ready?
Come on, wake up!
Now we'll look for a table down there.
In this crowd, I'll take even his pants off!
We'll take a table over there.
I forgot my cigarettes in my coat.
I'll be right back.
Sorry?
You, me, dance!
Fisherman!
You got that?
The wallet's tied with a chain.
It's all foreign propaganda about us.
How embarassing.
Poor Italy!
What do you care about Italy?
If he sticks to that nymphet, we're ruined.
So, what can you do?
- Must separate them.
And how?
He prefers the nymphet to us.
Call him stupid!
Let's see what her escort thinks about it.
See?
There he is.
Go tell him.
- Me?
!
Yessir!
Hurry up, go!
- But, I say...!
Ah, waiter...
- How dare you!
Don't you see I'm wearing a white tie?
So?
- So, keep yourself up-to-date!
Excuse me, huh?
Forgive me if I'm intruding in matters that shouldn't be my concern,..
but, you know, when you see some not-too-orthodox attitudes,..
by certain people who are, in a way, considered "guests",..
these are things that hurt!
Everyone!
They degrade!
They hurt!
You understand me?
- No.
Everybody who?
Us all!
Us Italians!
Do you see what that man is doing?
If you didn't notice, then look.
But what do you care?
Pardon!
If that is the way things are, I make amends!
If things are that way, can it be that ends badly!
That American is our friend, and we don't want him to be tricked.
It seems you guys didn't come to an agreement.
I didn't understand if you are with the Americans or the Italians.
I said what I had to say.
And I say, why worry?
The girl won't spoil your friend.
In less than an hour she'll give him back to you as such.
How much does your twinkie want?
Fiancée, please...
Her fare is 20,000, but tonight is a holiday, she might charge more.
That's true.
Then let's say, 50,000 for you and the rest for us.
What do you mean, the rest for you?
Here, if I understand, it's a matter of making a thorough lightening.
Exactly!
Then the normal fee does not apply.
If Milena must achieve full expropriation, it's a different story.
Milena doesn't do these things, it's risky.
Okay, let's do...half and half.
I'm putting the girl.
What do you put?
- The precedence.
But I'm putting the suffering too.
- But which?
Listen to that!
Why, you think that what Milena does, pleases me?
If it weren't for necessity...
Everytime I suffer.
I even get sick!
Do we take this into account?
Take it or leave it!
Or I'll tell the American to watch out.
Ok, I want to be generous tonight!
But now we've got to advise Milena without alarming the American.
You, come with me.
Go.
Milena, the subject is full of dough.
- I know, I can feel it.
Bring him to the 'Romeo and Juliet' pension, complete service.
- Complete?
You want a new oven, don't you?
Do as I tell you.
Maybe we can get a TV set as well.
Good night!
- Good night.
Waiter!
Waiter!
Can't you see the white...
- For the bill!
Certainly!
Good news!
The g..
I is alr...y ... move.
The girl is already on the move.
I know, he already told me.
- They're leaving.
Here it is.
This pays for the cigarette case!
Madam, we have arrived.
- One moment, I have to melt first!
Madam, what's the matter?
- I'm ankylosed.
- You feel bad?
No, no...
- Wait, I'll help you.
- I'm all stiff!
Just a moment.
Oh God, I'm falling!
Lady!
What's the matter?
Come, I'll help you.
Careful.
It's the cold.
Come on, come on!
Do you feel better?
I'm still cold, just a moment.
But please don't hit me again.
Don't worry, I wont.
- Please don't!
See?
You feel better?
Help me take the newspapers off.
How do you feel... better?
Thank you so much, you are very kind.
Hurrah for life!
What car have you got?
- A little station wagon.
But it runs!
This way.
Tortorella!
And how did she do?
Didn't find the Trevi fountain.
Look who it is!
Are we going to spend winter here?
Do you see Tortorella?
No, I can see the American car leaving!
Move, quick!
That bastard!
.
Where did he go?
- What happened?
- What do I know?
Some crazy woman showed up, he hugged her, threw her in the car and they left.
A blonde wearing fox?
- Yes.
Who the hell is it?
- I know who!
Hurry, let's go.
Where did they go?
What do I know?
- Put your foot down!
Slow down!
I said slow down!
At least close the windows.
I'm afraid we lost him for good!
Goodbye oven!
I'm afraid so.
- Where can they be?
Go straight then turn left.
- Why?
Listen to me, turn left.
- Got an idea?
- I want to go home!
I want to go to sleep.
- You stay here!
And you, drive!
Straight!
Oh God, he's gone crazy!
He's gone crazy!
What bath?
You've gone crazy?
All Americans bathe in the fountain.
- He saw it at the movies!
No, mister, it's not true.
A bunch of lies.
You mustn't believe it!
If you get wet, you get cold and you'll get a stroke.
Stroke...infarct...heart attack.
Whoever sent him?
- Warm!
All I needed was a drunk American tonight!
What good luck?
This is not the Ganges!
Damn the movies!
Finally!
We've been chasing you for a half hour!
We saw you in EUR, and then you vanished.
We caught the wrong subway.
- I know!
But I see you are in good company now.
God forbid!
He's a drunk American, and wants to bathe in the fountain.
Wants to bathe!
Go on!
I'll take care of it.
Let him do, lady!
It's alright!
The cops are used to this, don't worry.
Must take the jacket off before!
- Jacket?
Jacket, got it?
- That's right, no good jacket wet!
Ahh, the old man with the tails!
You, me, dive in.
You gotta be nuts!
Bathe, nude.
What nude!
If you get undressed, he will too.
- You're out of your mind!
Take it off!
- Hands off!
Guys, let's not exaggerate.
We're not abroad here!
The Pope lives here, so let's be decent.
- It's only a game, lady!
What game!
He doesn't even bathe at home!
He'll die for sure!
Come on, go away, get out of here!
- Keep your hands off orangutan!
What the...?
You and me, you go, I go.
We old men, strong.
I'm leaving!
Listen, you!
I said take off your jacket!
I don't give a damn, understand?
OK!
Naked, naked, naked, all naked!
- Help, let go!
I'll call the cops!
Yes, him naked too, don't worry.
Pants!
- Not the pants!
Pants!
- Don't touch my pants!
But you take off your jacket.
- No, no, no!
No, first he takes off the pants.
No, I won't take my pants off.
I never got undressed!
Hold it, there!
Is he crazy?
!
Well?
What are you doing?
- What the hell do you want?
Ego sum...
American citizen!
Well, OK, OK!
Put on your pants now!
He's resisting us!
Let's get him to the station where he can sober up.
Move!
So!
Are you happy now?
Not again!
You ruined my evening!
So tell me, are you happy now?
- Me?
Yes!
You and that nitwit.
That's why they call you "accident".
So, that's how they call me?
- Yessir!
You bring bad luck.
Yes, I bring bad luck!
I'm unlucky!
Where I walk, not a blade of grass grows!
You know who I am?
I'm like Attila!
So, stay away from me!
I'll swollen you!
- Let go!
I'll kill you!
Young men!
Why are are you arguing?
Why did you run off?
I fixed everything.
Keep calm and don't worry.
I understood he was a dangerous fool.
So I called the cops.
So, it was You?
- Sure!
- It's a joke, she didn't call anyone.
Of course I did!
The police station is near here.
But let's forget about it, it's still early.
What shall we do, Lello?
Tortorella, take the night bus and go home!
Umberto, go away!
What can we do?
I'll show you now!
I'm on fire!
Criminals!
Delinquents!
Behind!
Take a look!
Oh God, what is it?
They nearly killed me!
- It's nothing!
- Look there!
Who lives up there?
- What do I know?
I have an idea.
- Yeah, bust their faces!
- I have an idea!
It's like winning the lottery.
- What lottery?
Come on!
Listen, come here...
My ear drum!
The ear drum!
Burnt fur, injured ear drum.
Severe damages!
I want your names, to give to my lawyer... and have him settle the matter.
We'll send the fur to prove the damages suffered by us.
Terribly sorry.
We'd better see injuries and damages immediately.
Oh, they believe it!
I think they won't pay a penny!
Lady injured?
- I can't hear, you know?
Have you heard?
Lady can't hear!
So, damages must be paid.
Just a moment professor!
Forgive me dear.
I understand your reaction but calm down.
Even a headache!
- I think the blow just deafened her temporarily.
Right dear?
Yes dear!
- All she needs is a drink to feel better, and..
you'll be certainly happy to offer a cognac and your apologies.
Don't listen to him, do as I say.
Now stop it.
Just think, if they realise what's going on...
Well then, Professor, if you will bring your wife inside...
My wife?
- I'm not his wife.
She's my wife.
Thank you!
Listen, what's the idea?
Be quiet and thank me for saving you from the question of damages.
It was a good idea.
Let's go away.
- You crazy?
You go!
I've been telling you all night.
How embarassing with those beggar ideas of yours.
- Right!
You're quite right!
You're a mummer!
A mummer.
Let's behave like educated people.
Look what a lovely crowd it is.
And what a rich house!
She must be an ex-queen.
There are a lot of them around.
I hope you didn't hurt yourself,..
madam.
Tell me something,..
why did you say I was your wife?
There's a slight age difference.
I could be your older sister.
Sister?
Don't be ridiculous!
I don't understand.
Isn't it clear enough?
In revenge for the bad fireworks, would you like to fire all the flares?
What?
Oh, yes!
I'll light them all though, huh?
Well!
Put my purse somewhere, they won't steal it here.
I don't think there's any thief!
Thank you.
It isn't dangerous, huh?
Listen, you,..
you came into this house..
hiding yourself behind a lady, who is a very dear friend of mine.
Be careful, huh?
And remember, these are Germans.
I know how terrible the Nazis can be.
I'll report you to the police!
All I have to do is tell Tortorella one word, and...
What will our friends say?
When they know we didn't steal anything in this house!
Who cares?
You know what?
You're a fucking bastard
You take advantage of the fact that I can't do it alone.
Yes, i'm taking advantage of it!
I left the theatre for cinema.
Now cinema takes up all of my time, so... so!
Last year I made a very beautiful film.
It's a film you should know, it's about your country.
I remember they were all tall and good looking like you.
Ziegfreid!
Very beautiful.
This evening I left work at 8, just in time to get ready.
He should be in movies.
Yes.
I'll speak to my director about it.
He's got a face,..
a face that goes through the screen.
Why are you laughing, stupid?
I agree with your idea, gentlemen!
For actors, the theatre is an important school!
No road, no, no!
I was on stage at 14 as assistant to a great comedian.
Then I went on to be a star for all my life.
Do you know that theatre play..
"The wagon-lit controller"?
Umberto, dear, you think these people are interested in that stuff?
Pardon, Fräulein
- This is vaudeville stuff, forget it!
What a lovely house.
So many lights!
I feel like I'm in the Vatican.
Really!
I feel also...
I feel also..
a strange emotion,madam, because it reminds me of when I saw the Pope.
If you would like to look around, be my guest!
- May we?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Shall we go?
Thank you so much.
Umberto, gotta leave us alone now, huh?
Do you like classical music?
You know what I like.
I'm afraid..
that all this champagne on an empty stomach is going to make my head spin.
I drank little, but my head..
is spinning too.
He insists!
Look, I've got it!
All the better.
Who would ever imagined... to begin the year with a husband... in a house filled with princes!
Mamma mia!
You had a great idea to invite us in.
Look.
You know that a little thing like this..
is worth a bunch of 10,000 bills?
No kidding?
Look at all this stuff!
The paintings!
The stuff!
Look at this, Lello!
No!
It's too big.
There it is, my true passion!
Small stuff, and beautiful.
How I understand you!
I like them too.
Especially because it's useless.
After all, you can tell a gentleman by this.
By their passion for useless things.
You're not stupid, after all!
I want to tell you something else.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're going too fast!
Young man, keep cool, huh?
I'm not easily convinced.
What are you talking about?
I like you!
And you too don't dislike me!
