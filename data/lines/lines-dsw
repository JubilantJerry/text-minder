-Yeah.
-He came to see me yesterday.
I haven't spoken to him for years.
He just turned up.
He's involved.
All this, Jacob, Angela...
What makes you say that?
That he's involved?
[sighs]
I don't know.
He knows that I've been seeing Bobby.
He said that I should find out what Bobby has been doing in Düsseldorf.
I should find out and tell him.
Crowley is asking you to find out about our investigation?
Let's go back because--
Can you explain to us, please, why Dr. Crowley believes that he can get you to give him information?
He was my psychiatrist some time ago.
A psychiatrist knows things, every bit of a person's life.
He's saying he'll use that.
Has Dr. Crowley threatened to use something he knows about you?
I came here because, um...
What happened to Angela, I--
I had to tell you even though I'm scared of what he might do.
Tell us how Crowley is involved in this, Miss Cannonbury.
I don't know.
All I know is what I've told you.
Talk to him.
I'm asking you to find that out.
We will.
You said he might do something.
What is it Dr. Crowley might do?
There's, um...
There's...
There's something...
Uh, there's something...
that I'm ashamed of.
What I want to do is to hide away.
But I came here.
You were a witness in a crime that Bobby is investigating.
Do you realize now what this might do to his career?
-What this might do to him?
-You don't like me because of Bobby.
I didn't choose to meet Bobby like this.
I didn't pursue him.
He came to me.
I saw someone who is struggling.
I like Bobby.
He's likeable.
I'm not going to apologize for that.
But I will leave Bobby alone now.
Find out about Chris Crowley.
[Sheri] It was around here Ruben met the man.
[sighs] Lucy, come on.
-Call me, talk to me.
-[Sheri] It was definitely around here.
Sheri, are you sure you saw something?
Yeah... definitely.
Yeah...
I think so.
Alec, we can talk to Crowley tomorrow.
-We have to find Steffan Fairweather.
-Are you coming with me?
[car door shuts]
That's him!
That's the man Ruben met!
[Lucy] Stay back, Sheri!
[in German] Stop, we just want to ask you some questions!
[all panting]
[Lucy, in German] We want to talk to you.
-[thud] -[grunts]
-[Walti] Bairam Kocak.
-[groaning]
-You know him?
-Drug dealer.
The jump was spectacular.
The landing was not so good.
When Angela Benton was killed, there was an effort, quite a professional effort, to make it appear Jacob Appley had done it.
What we're asking, Dr. Crowley, is why was Jacob chosen?
Well, how can I know the answer to that?
-You were his doctor for...
How long?
-Eight years.
There was a deliberate attempt to make it look like Jacob had some kind of schizophrenic attack.
-So he was chosen for that reason.
-Mm...
The killer dressed up like Jacob, so he must have studied Jacob.
-Oh, I see what you're saying.
-So why him?
Because, um...
Uh, well, he lives nearby?
[stammers] I don't--
Sorry, I don't know why you're asking me.
We should look at Jacob's medical history.
Well, why should that matter if he's the victim?
We're not here to tell you why it matters.
We're here to tell you what we want.
Did you speak to Lucy Cannonbury about this investigation?
I went to see her to see how she was.
Did you ask her to find out about our investigation?
[Chris] Find out?
No.
That's bizarre, isn't it?
[chuckles]
-Is that what she said?
-Hello, darling.
Am I interrupting something?
Mrs. Wayfield, uh, we're... we're just questioning Dr. Crowley.
So if you--
-Would anybody like a drink?
-No, no.
No drinks.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you using my mother like this?
-Alexander, don't speak like that.
-Well, why now, Mother?
Why has he got his hooks into you again now?
-I want you to leave here right away.
-Well, I'm not ready to leave.
Why are you being so excitable?
I'm a policeman.
I'm here on police business.
I can see what it does to you, darling.
It doesn't suit your personality.
Enough!
I will deal with this, Alec.
-Dr.
Crowley, we're going now.
-Yes, look, I'm sorry about this.
If...
If I can help you with Jacob Appley, I will.
-Just tell me what it is you want.
-I want you to leave my mother alone.
We want to see Jacob's medical records.
And if we have to get a court order, then we will.
No, there is really no need.
I will supply them.
Of course, I will.
Tomorrow, you will present yourself for questioning under police caution.
[Monica] You can't treat this man this way.
My son has his own personal reasons for behaving like this.
It's unfair.
You think Chris is taking advantage of me?
No.
I'm exploiting his kindness.
I turned up here uninvited.
I played on his sympathy.
I know what I am.
And I know what you think of me.
But do not blame him.
[panting]
[sighs]
[Walti] Bairam, is it okay with you if we speak in English?
Because we have a nice English detective with us.
It's him there.
Bobby Day.
And you know how the English are about language.
Everybody has to learn theirs.
[Bairam sighs]
-Bairam, how is your foot?
-Are you taking the piss?
Oh, so your English is pretty good.
Bairam, you knew Ruben Locana.
Ruben?
No.
Locana?
Mm-mm.
I don't know this person, not me.
Mm-mm.
You never met him?
Never spoke to him?
No, not at all.
Mm-mm.
[buckle clicks]
Are you okay?
Talk to me.
Alec, we'll get Crowley.
I don't know what he's got to do with this, but he's skin-creep guilty of something.
Alec.
Hey.
-Are you there?
-I don't want her there with him.
She can look after herself.
[sighs]
I found pictures of my mother, when I was young.
You mean...
Pictures?
Yeah.
[sighs] That's heavy.
-Are you saying he took those pictures?
-I don't know.
Tomorrow, we will get him.
Okay?
[car engine starts]
Hey!
Alec!
[Walti] It's a website called Buff.
It provides local advertisements, forums for jobs, housing, things for sale, and lots of personal ads.
-You mean sex?
-Oh, I mean sex.
People say where they are and what they're up for.
You seem to know a lot about this site, Walti.
-I bought a gazebo.
-Oh.
Not all gay men are promiscuous, you know.
So, um...
This site, you found something?
-Ruben had a page on here.
-You had three boyfriends at one time.
That's not promiscuous.
That's unfaithful.
One of them was almost ex.
One of them was non-sexual.
So, what's on this page?
I remember that gazebo.
It fell down when you had a barbeque.
-Walti.
-Um, yeah.
This site has "friends".
Now I looked at Ruben's friends.
"Bairam Kocak."
It's so beautiful that criminals go on the Internet.
It's like they want to help us find them.
Great.
I printed up some pages on Ruben's profile.
[Linda] So come on.
Let's go, Bobby, come on.
[Walti] This is you.
This is Ruben Locana.
Not so good for me, huh?
Not so good for you.
-[Bairam] Immunitet?
-[Walti] Speak in English.
-[Walti] So our guest can understand.
-[Linda] Immunity from what?
-From prosecution.
-Why should we do that?
If I tell you something that-- Hey, I won't be the man in a good light.
You are already the man not in a good light, Bairam.
-Immunitet.
-Ruben Locana was killed.
You haven't come here to have a cup of tea and give us a few tip-offs.
Bobby, you're not allowed to ask questions.
Yes.
He is not allowed to ask questions.
Ruben was a top-end medic.
Why would he buy drugs from a lump of piss like you?
Bobby, you have no--Zuständigkeit?
-[Walti] Jurisdiction.
-[Linda] Jurisdiction.
Yes, he has no jurisdiction.
And no questions from the English.
-Listen, you drug dealing loser...
-Hey!
-[Walti] Bobby...
-No jurisdiction!
No jurisdiction!
[Linda speaking in German]
But he is right, Bairam.
Murder.
Look at me.
See that in my eyes?
That's what the truth looks like.
I will try to get you immunity.
So tell me.
You think that I'm Ruben's dealer, huh?
Ruben was my dealer, okay?
-Go on.
-Ruben could get all kinds of medicines.
Hard-on pills, diet pills, drugs to make you sleep, make you wake.
It's a big business.
This is why Ruben is in his pool, dead.
[phone ringing]
Alec, where are you?
A neighbor just told us that Fairweather borrowed her caravan sometimes.
It's in a field by Welsh Lane, up towards Winsford Flashes.
Sure.
[engine revving]
[door handle rattles] [gasps]
[shovel clatters]
[rattling]
Hey!
What are you doing?
-Hey!
-[footsteps on roof]
Hey, I'm police!
I'm the police!
[gasps] What are you doing?
[gasps] [pants, gasps] [shudders, gasps]
Oh, God.
[panting]
[Nina] Let me out!
[groans, grunts] [engine idling]
[pants] [gasps, coughs]
[both coughing]
Get out of sight.
He's still out there.
[coughs]
-[gunshot] -[shudders]
What was that?
[engine revving]
-Is he gone?
-[both panting] [both exhale]
I told you!
I told you all!
Stay away!
You'll bring them to me!
Look what you've done!
I've lost everything!
No one is safe now.
[Eerie whooshing]
No.
- Don't!
- [Gunshot]
- [Screams]
- Oh, oh, oh.
[Shouts]
[Gunshot]
[Gasping]
[Phone vibrating]
[Female electronic voice] You have six new messages.
[Woman] North, it's Beth.
I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.
[Machine beeps]
[Man] This call is for Mr. North Maxfield.
This is a courtesy call regarding your mortgage with us here.
[Machine beeps]
[Woman] Ginny, hi.
It's Joan from Willow fitness.
[Machine beeps]
[Beth] Hey, it's Beth.
I'm not sure if this will help, but here's the number of the doctor you and Carl discussed.
Her name is Dr. Sarah Carson, 405...
[Machine beeps]
[Woman #2] North, it's mom.
I'm here at the airport.
I wish you would come home with us.
If you change your mind...
[Machine beeps]
[North] Does it work?
Depends.
On?
[Sarah] Who you're working with and what you do with it.
I've had a lot of success with people who are open to it.
[North] Hmm!
What brought you to me?
My wife was murdered a month ago.
The police say they'll probably never catch whoever did it.
I woke up in the hospital.
I'm sorry to hear that.
But not her, she was gone.
She wasn't there with me.
Are you on any doctor prescribed medications?
Not anymore.
Why hypnosis?
I remember some things, they're just gaping holes.
Have you tried writing this down?
No, thank you.
It's never anything but bits and pieces anyway.
The truth is in those bits and pieces.
These used to mean something.
Now they're just reminders of a job I can't do anymore.
What's that like?
Everything is jumbled in my head.
Things don't make sense anymore.
I can't remember things.
Her...
If I could just see her...
If I could just understand how it happened...
I think I could put this All back together.
There are many different techniques for hypnosis.
Some are like guided meditations, or are conscious of everything around you.
What I do is deep trance hypnosis.
I lead you into your subconscious with an intention, and there we reconnect the memories.
How does it sound?
If it helps me remember, I'm game.
You may experience a sensation of lightness, you may feel you're floating, out of body experience.
Is that still okay?
- Sure.
- Good.
Let's begin.
Study my hand.
Hear the calmness in my voice.
I want you to concentrate on, and only on my index finger.
You may hear the sounds in the room, but none of that matters as you focus on the sound of my voice.
Watch... as the other fingers fall away.
- Breathe...
- [North exhales]
As I count down, five, four, three, two, one.
[Sarah] Don't try to find a memory All at once.
Remember a piece, an element...
Of your wife...
And your life together.
[Sarah] Find your own internal guide and follow it.
Where would you like to go today?
Element.
Ginny!
[Gunshot]
[Sarah] Can you hear the sound of my voice?
[Clanging]
[Gasps]
[Panting]
[Crying]
It worked.
You were under about sixteen minutes.
It only felt like moments.
It's a different world there.
People are different, time is different.
This memory is a piece.
You build on that.
Can I come back?
Of course.
[Elevator bell dings]
[Chattering]
Morning, Beth.
Keep your head down, Carl is on the warpath.
[North] Alan, hi.
Hey, how's your wife?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Um...
Right, right, I just wanted to check in about what we had talked about six months ago, I just...
No, no, no.
I understand, I hear what you're saying and... and I don't think you need to move this account.
I really don't.
I want you to feel like you can completely trust me again.
Ah, I'm better, I really am, I mean, I'm back.
That's why I wanted to call you today.
So, here is what's going on.
Yes, I did have a head injury, I got your "thank you" card,
I really appreciate it.
I'm back two hundred percent.
Trust me, if You'll just have a little faith in me, just have a little...
An ounce of faith in me, which I know you find hard.
I get it, I get that you're worried about me,
I get that you're worried about, you know, where we're going, I promise you, twenty-five percent.
I hear you, I need you to reconsider.
I just, I need you to think about this,
I mean, I, just listen to me, okay,
I know what I'm talking about.
Thank you, Mr. Wong.
Ah, yeah.
- [Mr.Wong] How you feeling?
- I'm doing fine, doing fine.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about...
We're taking a different route, we got some new ideas, some emerging markets.
Look, let's have lunch?
[Mr. Wong] I just don't think that's a good idea.
- Hey, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.
- No.
Albert, how's Hollywood?
Yeah, I know.
You can't do this to me Albert, I mean...
[Chattering, phones ringing]
Hey man, it's Carl, call me back.
Three, two, one.
[Static crackles]
Element.
[North] My wife.
[Bells chiming]
This was the night.
I died shortly after this.
What happens after this?
Are you sure you're ready to remember?
Soon.
[Sarah] What was different this time?
[North] When I'm under, it's real.
- I'm with her.
- [Sarah] But it's not real.
She's not really there.
You need to let her go.
[North] I can't let go.
She says I'm not ready yet.
[Sarah] It's your mind that's not ready.
You need to be out, talking, meeting people...
Not isolating yourself.
Sometimes letting go of someone is how you find the answers.
[North] If I let go, she'll be gone forever.
[Woman] So, what's it like?
[North] It's amazing.
It's like a dream you don't want to wake up from.
How did you get into it?
My wife died.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's a long story, but it's the only way
I can still feel close to her again.
Hmm.
How'd she die?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
I mean, she was shot.
That's terrible.
I just don't remember a lot from that night.
Hmm, maybe next time you're under you could ask her.
Guess I never thought about that.
- I should get going.
- Is it something I said?
No, you seem like a really nice guy, but you're still married.
That's not what I was...
I wasn't...
I wasn't trying to...
- All right.
- [Clock ticking]
[Sarah] How are things at work?
Work is getting harder and harder.
There's a lot of pressure there.
My boss...
The guy who runs our department is riding me hard because of my memory issues.
We really haven't talked about these issues.
Why don't we discuss those next time?
I'm going to be late for work.
Remember...
I can't make you feel or do anything.
You don't lose your free will, you're always awake, always aware, and always in control.
Watch, as the other fingers fade away.
Breathe.
The count down...
Five, four, three, two, one.
Element?
Home.
I know I was wrong, I'm sorry.
I was overwhelmed.
Overwhelmed?
No, I mean, I wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.
No shit!
Who put you up to this?
- No one.
- You're lying, I know you.
You might have gone along with it, but you wouldn't have done it on your own.
I can get out of this.
Did you think about me;
About what it would do to us?
[North] I did this for us!
Ginny, please...
As much as you want to keep seeing me, you know where this goes.
I don't see you here like this anymore.
You're going to have to remember on your own.
She's going to wake me up...
Please don't leave, stay with me.
[Fingers snap]
You're going to come out, now.
[Exhales]
How long was I out?
Fifty-seven minutes.
She was there with me at home.
It was after dinner the night she was killed.
You didn't make it home that night.
I tried to change it.
Hypnosis is a bridge between our conscious and our subconscious.
You can't create a memory to suppress another.
It's the easiest way to forget what's real and what isn't.
[Train horn blares]
[Bartender] That's your last one, north.
At least somebody is looking out for me.
[Ginny] Tell me where it is!
[Grunts]
[Patrons whispering]
Yeah, uh, no.
I'll call you back.
You're late.
- Traffic.
- And your phone is off.
There's so much shit going on around here for your phone to be off.
Sorry.
Andrex, where are you with that report?
I need those numbers.
I need access to those accounts.
They're our biggest client.
And we ought to be able to give them something.
Put them on hold.
Nothing's on hold.
It's been three months since you...
You know it's at risk if we don't give them something, right?
I can't remember, I'm trying.
Still seeing that woman, that shrink?
Of course.
How's that going?
[Exhales]
I got to give them some reassurance.
I mean, they've been more than patient with us at this point.
But sooner or later, I got to pull the trigger.
So, you take some time off and you figure this out.
And I need to be able to call you on your phone if I need your help, okay?
I'm trying to be understanding here, but you need to get your shit together, for both of our sake.
- Look, if I could just...
- This is not a discussion.
Because with everything you know about this place, our clients and the people we work with...
I can't have you this fucking incomprehensible.
I will burn you if you don't give me what I want.
[Rock music playing]
- [North] No.
- [Ginny] Tell him where it is!
- Her!
- No, don't!
- [Gunshot] -[Ginny] They're going to come for you now.
[Knocking on door]
This is unexpected.
I'm sorry to bother you, can I come in?
You didn't call to make an appointment.
I know but, it's...
Got bad today.
I didn't know where else to go.
I'm not seeing any other patients till this afternoon, but... you can't just show up like this in the future.
Understood.
[Both exhale]
Is there something you want to talk about?
Just put me under.
What do you want to find?
I want to go back to my wife, she was going to tell me something before I remembered the argument.
How did you meet Ginny?
We met at a work function when I got out of college.
I was working at a startup investment firm,
I went to one of the client's fundraisers
- and she was there.
- Love at first sight?
Yeah, it was.
We were...
Inseparable, got married six months later.
Things were good.
And then one day you wake up and look over...
And wonder how you got here.
- Did you argue?
- Sure.
What did you argue about most?
Money.
What else did you argue about?
Everything!
It's possible that this history of conflict has created a barrier.
There's only one way to find out.
Hear the sound of my voice.
I want you to open your eyes on one hundred, close on ninety-nine.
One hundred, ninety-nine.
Relax your breathing.
Feel the weight of your body leave you.
Element?
- My wife.
- Element?
I want to see her one more time, please.
I know you can answer me.
Element.
Revenge.
I know...
It doesn't make sense.
Did she have to die?
[Gunshot]
[North] I need to see Ginny.
You have to take me to her.
[Clanging]
[North] Don't wake me up!
Take me to Ginny.
Don't wake me up!
No!
[Clanking]
Holy fuck!
[Breathing heavily]
How long was I out?
Seventy-two minutes.
- That was...
- [North] Intense!
Your memories are building.
When can I come back?
Let me get my appointment calendar.
No, no, no.
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
- So, what did they say?
- As if you don't know.
Come on, be more specific.
I can't remember anything.
Son of a bitch is running out of time.
I know, I'm working on it.
Don't tell me that.
I am gonna start wondering what your problem is.
If I ask one more time, we're going to make a lot of people nervous.
What do you want from me?
There is the other way.
Leave your cell phone on.
I'll be in touch.
Can I try a reposado, please?
Drinking alone?
- Looks like it.
- They say that's bad luck.
Who's they?
[Anna] Thank you.
Do I know you?
Sorry, you just look really familiar to me.
- I'm Anna.
- North.
- North?
- Uh-huh.
I like it.
You from around here?
No, visiting.
- Family?
- Work.
Cheers.
What about you?
You live around here?
I do.
Married?
Ah, I was.
What do you do for work?
I was a financial Advisor.
- Was?
- Taking a break.
It's that bad?
Ask me again in an hour.
Probably won't be here in an hour.
[Chuckles]
I'm also in town to see my new therapist.
Is that bad to admit?
Of course not.
What kind of therapy?
Why?
You need somebody to talk to?
[Both chuckle]
- Maybe!
- [Anna chuckles]
You ever heard of Ericksonian technique?
Yeah, I've heard of him.
My therapist is in his style.
I don't know, I may or may not see him again.
Did you call a cab?
Yes, thank you.
So, I have a couple of meetings in the morning.
I thought maybe we could grab a coffee after, and you could tell me more about this therapy I signed up for?
- Do I have a choice?
- No!
Don't forget.
You getting hers?
I guess so.
I want to speak to Ginny.
Based on your interaction with her in the trance world,
I'm not sure that's the best approach.
Why?
Have you ever kept a secret, really kept one...
Something about yourself you can't discuss?
The mind works the same way.
I don't understand.
Whatever secret your mind is hiding,
Ginny is not the one with the answers.
- It lies elsewhere.
- Then how do we find it?
I'd like to try a different technique to put you under.
A simple handshake.
Action learned as a single chunk of behavior.
Tying your shoelaces is another example.
[Sarah] When that action is diverted...
The mind responds by suspending itself in trance.
[Typing on keyboard]
What is this?
- Element?
- Why did you bring me here?
What do you want me to see?
Take me back to my office.
I need to understand why the accounts were changed.
[Static crackles]
Element.
There's nothing else.
Tell me why you brought me here?
[Sarah] North!
North!
How long?
Nearly two hours.
You can't force your mind to travel places it doesn't want to go.
I came here to be with my wife.
Why can't she take me to her?
I don't know about can't, but she won't.
She has to.
No, I think it's like when you were a senior,
I was, like, potty training.
[Laughing]
You probably don't even know who Elvis is, do you?
Oh, okay, nice.
Or we can talk about hypnosis some more.
[Laughing]
Thank you for listening, seriously.
You're welcome.
I had fun today.
Me too.
It's been a while since I've been out.
With what, another woman?
Doesn't matter.
So, this is the infamous wall?
That's it.
What are the empty spots?
Those are of the things I've figured out.
Fascinating.
Well, it's a work in progress, but...
No, I meant you.
Hey!
You okay?
Yeah.
Where you headed?
Work, travel, home.
I'll be back.
When?
Soon!
- Last night...
- [Anna chuckles]
It was...
[Anna chuckles]
But...
It's too soon.
It's okay.
Disappointing, but it's okay.
Can I get a zip up, please?
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Are you starting to remember your wife's death?
I'm not sure I want to.
Would knowing be worse than what you're putting yourself through now?
I'm not going to tell you it's time to move on, but denying your memories, repressing them who you are, who you were...
I just think you're strong enough to handle it.
You don't know me.
Yeah, but...
I'm older and wiser, and I know that living in a dream world is a good way to lose sight of the real world.
That's exactly why I do it.
I get it, but it doesn't solve anything.
They're still... here.
There are seven billion people on this planet.
There are those of us that like ourselves and those that don't.
You accept it and you move forward.
I know what you're saying.
Do you?
I have to go.
[North] Call me?
[Anna chuckling]
[Door shuts]
[Typing on keyboard]
[Carl, Joseph chattering]
Can I help you?
You can't, he can.
We're in a meeting here.
Is that right?
Andrex, I'm finding things, this doesn't add up.
Add up?
You're a fucking nightmare, you know that?
[North] What is this?
Excuse me.
This, this is cancer.
Now if we don't get a hold on this now, everything's blown.
And everybody is going down with this ship.
What are you telling me?
I'm asking you to do the right thing here.
Why are you changing their quarterly reports?
When the fuck did you become so soft?
Jesus!
You want me to cover this for you?
You want me to tell them their returns add up just fine?
They're not going to notice that while oil and gas prices rose, their royalty payments remained stagnant?
Keep your voice down.
You can't just Bernie Madoff this shit.
You're talking about millions of dollars, messing with signatures, fraudulent IRS documents and god knows what else, from andrex.
You know how powerful they are, are you fucking crazy?
You want to practice your babe in the woods routine, be my guest.
But how exactly do you think those numbers got turned around?
Ahh.
No, I didn't.
Yes, yes you did, partner.
[Carl] Do you have access to those Cayman accounts now?
No, what accounts?
God damn it.
Find it.
Are you sleeping with him?
No, but it looks like I'm going to have to.
[Laughing]
[Slams desk]
[Light thud]
[Exhales]
[Clears throat]
[Phone ringing]
[Anna] Hi, you've reached my voicemail, please leave a message.
[Beeps]
Hey, it's me.
Ah, just calling to see if you're free to talk?
I had kind of a rough day, so just...
Could use someone to talk to.
Anyway, call me back.
Bye.
[Yawns]
Joseph!
Carl!
What are you doing here?
Hmm.
I'm done playing games.
[Electrical buzzing]
[Gasping]
Please... don't!
Don't kill me!
Then talk to me.
It's on the jump drive.
What?
It's on the jump drive.
North hid it.
Come on, now, relax and enjoy it.
[Gasping]
Relax now, come on.
Come on, now, relax and enjoy it.
[Exhales]
Picture yourself descending a flight of stairs, counting each step down starting at ten.
As you take a step, feel the step under your foot.
Once you get to the last step, imagine and truly feel yourself stepping off into a relaxing pool of water.
Feel yourself falling down through the water deeper and deeper.
You should start to feel somewhat numb.
Your heart will start to race a bit.
Embrace it.
Just let the fears about your situation just drift away into the water.
[Heart beating]
Element?
You already know what I want, don't you?
Two hundred.
Yeah, I'm out.
Your 200...
And 400 more.
Let's see what you've got.
The bet's 600 to you, sir.
I'm out.
Fold.
Fold.
So... you really don't know who I am, huh?
Not a clue?
I don't know you.
That's right.
The shoe doesn't know me, I forgot.
Should I?
Maybe not.
Maybe, no.
Maybe not.
Hey, it's on you.
You going to talk or play cards?
You can piss off.
You like that?
Watch this.
[Fingers snap]
You really don't get it, do you?
I was in Carl's office, but that's not where you would know me.
What the fuck!
You were the one.
[In Joseph's voice] They're going to come for you now.
[Gasps]
[Screaming]
- [Shouts] - [Screaming]
[Retching]
What happened?
How did you...
- Why are you on the floor?
- How the hell did you do that?
- You need to go.
- Wait!
Shit!
Let me think.
There were others, strangers, I was attacked.
Hmm.
[North] Did I hurt you?
How was I able to do that?
I don't know.
Just go!
She knew, she already knew where I wanted to go.
How is that possible?
I'm sorry.
Please, please, just help me understand!
I didn't agree to do this, just go!
I just want you All to just go away!
Get the fuck out of here!
[Door slams]
[Phone vibrating]
Yeah, hello?
[Beth] North?
It's Beth.
What's happened?
[Beth] Carl Mackey, he killed himself.
They think he overdosed.
North?
North?
I'm a patient of hers.
Yes, she knows who I am.
Why won't she call me back?
I know you're an answering service, I get that.
Yes, this is an emergency, why do you...
Fine, just have her call me back, thank you.
God damn it!
- [Cars driving by] - [People chattering]
[Breathing heavily]
[Eerie whooshing]
[Knocking on door]
[Knocking on door]
North Maxfield?
Yes.
Can we talk for a moment?
What's this about?
Carl Mackey.
Interesting choice in decor.
Beth said that Carl killed himself.
Did he leave a note?
Depends on how you view that question.
Oh, now, that is an interesting note.
Found it stuck to his computer, so it's pretty new.
Do I need to get a lawyer?
I don't think so, but I have been known to be wrong from time to time.
Any idea what this note is about?
Not a clue.
Now, the interesting thing to me is the little argument you two had.
Now, the way I understand it from your colleagues, you bashed his face in his desk.
Now, if it were me, I would press charges, but I know how you investment types are at protecting each other from the outside world, while stabbing each other in the back.
It wasn't a big deal.
"Burn this motherfucker", doesn't sound like no big deal.
One guy has something on the other, stuff like this happens.
- Am I going to jail?
- Not today.
Where were you night before last?
Here, working.
- Anyone with you?
- No, no one was with me.
But I'm sure I made some calls from here.
Did you have any idea that Mr. Mackey was shooting up?
I mean, everyone said that he was acting edgy lately, but... but not strung out.
I wouldn't know.
I haven't spoken to him much lately.
Not since your wife.
I heard.
Listen, I need to get back to work.
So what did you have on him anyway, huh?
I think I'd like you to leave.
I mean, why are you getting so defensive?
I'm still dealing with the death of my wife.
[Breathing heavily]
Sarah!
- Are you here?
- [Slams door]
What are you doing here?
- I need your help.
- I can't see you.
Please, I'm desperate.
That's exactly why I can't see you anymore.
What does that mean?
- You've become dependent.
- Dependent on what?
What did you expect by coming here?
I came here for help, to remember.
- To feel normal again.
- Do you?
Do you feel normal?
- That's not the fucking point.
- Answer the question.
- Do you feel normal?
- Not in a very long time.
I have headaches, thoughts of shit
I can't make sense of.
Nosebleeds?
You didn't tell me about that.
My nose bleeds, they're getting worse.
Those are side effects I'm talking about.
I puke into the garbage can every time I wake up from being asleep.
You've become addicted.
To hypnosis?
Are you kidding me?
Stop it!
Stop it!
No, no, no, no.
The truth you've been looking for, you've found it.
You just won't admit it.
Fuck you!
You know that, fuck you!
Fuck you.
Please!
Please, please, I'm sorry.
Please.
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
I won't put you under anymore.
They...
listen... they might be able to help you more than I could.
The other day you said something.
What did you mean when you said,
"you wanted us All to go away"?
[Door shuts]
He's close.
[Door shuts]
[Door shuts]
[North] Picture yourself descending a flight of stairs.
Counting each step down.
Starting at ten.
[Female voice whispers]
[Ticking]
[Whispering continues]
[Woman] Deeper, and deeper...
Element.
What's happening to me?
Is this the beginning or the end?
[Grunting]
- [Gunshot] - [Screaming]
[Coughing]
[Groans]
[Knocking on door]
I'm sorry, I was traveling, I didn't call.
You said you would.
What happened to your face?
Who did this to you?
Can I come in...
Please?
[Door shuts]
[Anna] What is this?
- Where are your band-aids?
- Bathroom.
- [North] I called.
- I know you did.
[North] My doctor won't see me anymore.
Why?
The last time I was under, I attacked her.
While you were in trance?
[Sighs]
So, what has this have to do with your face?
There was a man after me.
He was chasing me with a gun, he gave me this.
Where, in your subconscious?
Just let me get to...
Tell me, how is that even possible?
So, you hurt yourself?
I went under, this wasn't there.
I came out and it was.
Okay, wait.
Who put you under?
- I did.
- When?
Tonight.
He finds me now.
He finds me and it's like he's trying to kill me.
But I feel like the answers are right there.
What can I do?
If these people are coming after you in your trance, that must mean something, right?
I think Ginny was a mistake.
I'm just...
I'm right there, I'm so close.
Why are you here?
I...
I don't know what you mean, I...
I mean, why did you come back?
[Whispers] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
What if I do it, what if I put you under?
No.
What if I don't come out of it?
I won't let you go.
Mmm-mmm.
Okay.
[Clock ticking]
- [Static crackles] - [Screaming]
How could you have done this?
Carl said we could get away with it.
These companies have hundreds of millions of dollars and tons of investments, they never realize their royalty payments were a little low.
I did this for us.
For us?
And that makes it okay?
And this woman you've been seeing, what about her, was she part of your plan?
I was afraid Anna was on to us, I had to find out.
North, wake up!
[Static crackles]
[Panting]
[Whooshing]
[Static crackles]
Why is she here?
Why is she here?
[Anna] Where are you?
Who are you with?
What do you see?
Why did you bring me here, answer me?
- [Gunshot]
- No!
Anna!
Where are you?
You should have been here by now.
North?
[Screams]
Don't scream.
North, please!
- What are you doing?
- How did she know?
Answer me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
My wife!
She knew about you.
- How?
- She didn't.
How?
Answer me or I swear...
Tell me who sent you?
[Anna] Stop this.
You are scaring me, please.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
I want you to give me the gun, okay.
Let me help you.
Oh!
You are a liar!
You're a liar.
I can explain, okay.
But if you hurt me, there are huge consequences.
You will never wake up from this.
I don't plan to.
Out, we're going out now.
She showed me where this ends.
North, you are losing it.
I know what's real and what's not.
Why did you ransack my place?
- I didn't, you're crazy.
- I don't believe you.
Stop it!
[Groaning]
Who are you?
Who sent you?
No one sends me anywhere.
Get off of me.
I still can't believe you don't remember who I am.
Andrex, Anna andrex.
And you stole my money.
[Joseph] North!
Wait, wait.
Wait.
You're so late.
Well, it seems that the doctor has been playing both sides against the middle.
What?
Who?
Justice department.
Found this card at her place.
It's the same one that was on his wall.
I knew it.
I'm sorry.
Were you ever trying to help me?
Yes.
Please, north.
From the moment I met you, I knew you were a good man.
That was before.
I've done things.
I'm not who I was.
Yes, you are.
Ginny's gone.
You remember why now, don't you?
What happened?
Accept the truth, it's the only way out of this.
This is getting us nowhere.
Just wait.
Is she with us?
Is she here?
[Static crackles]
The money you stole, where is it stashed?
No, forget it.
Tell him where the money is.
What are you going to do...
Kill me?
No, her.
- [Gunshot]
- No, no!
You know what this makes you?
A witness.
- [Gunshot] - [Yelps]
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[Static crackles]
I got her killed.
[Crying]
I got her killed.
If I had just told you, she'd still be here!
North, you won't hurt me.
Here's how this ends.
You give me back the money you stole, you do this for me and we All walk away.
You can have a fresh start.
[Agent] You and your wife could have a fresh start.
This is your chance.
You're close to the numbers and you know them well.
You do this, we could talk about immunity from what you've done.
I will be with you through the whole process.
Think of me as your guide, I'm going to provide you All the elements you need.
I was getting out.
I was getting out.
Why didn't you come find me?
After the accident...
You lost it.
Your memory...
You were going to talk to Ginny about it that night and get back to her with an answer.
What are you talking about, get back to who?
His little angel in the justice department.
[Laughing]
This...
This is All you want.
This is All they want.
[Laughing]
This will destroy you.
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
[Grunting]
[Groans]
[Police sirens wail in distance]
What was on the drive?
Those are for you.
North, don't do this to me.
[Grunting]
Ginny didn't have to die.

Oh, oh, oh.
You have six new messages.
North, it's Beth.
I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.
This call is for Mr. North Maxfield.
This is a courtesy call regarding your mortgage with us here.
Ginny, hi.
It's Joan from Willow fitness.
Hey, it's Beth.
I'm not sure if this will help, but here's the number of the doctor you and Carl discussed.
Her name is Dr. Sarah Carson, 405...
North, it's mom.
I'm here at the airport.
I wish you would come home with us.
If you change your mind...
Does it work?
Depends.
On?
Who you're working with and what you do with it.
I've had a lot of success with people who are open to it.
Hmm!
What brought you to me?
My wife was murdered a month ago.
The police say they'll probably never catch whoever did it.
I woke up in the hospital.
I'm sorry to hear that.
But not her, she was gone.
She wasn't there with me.
Are you on any doctor prescribed medications?
Not anymore.
Why hypnosis?
I remember some things, they're just gaping holes.
Have you tried writing this down?
No, thank you.
It's never anything but bits and pieces anyway.
The truth is in those bits and pieces.
These used to mean something.
Now they're just reminders of a job I can't do anymore.
What's that like?
Everything is jumbled in my head.
Things don't make sense anymore.
I can't remember things.
Her...
If I could just see her...
If I could just understand how it happened...
I think I could put this All back together.
There are many different techniques for hypnosis.
Some are like guided meditations, or are conscious of everything around you.
What I do is deep trance hypnosis.
I lead you into your subconscious with an intention, and there we reconnect the memories.
How does it sound?
If it helps me remember, I'm game.
You may experience a sensation of lightness, you may feel you're floating, out of body experience.
Is that still okay?
- Sure.
- Good.
Let's begin.
Study my hand.
Hear the calmness in my voice.
I want you to concentrate on, and only on my index finger.
You may hear the sounds in the room, but none of that matters as you focus on the sound of my voice.
Watch... as the other fingers fall away.
Breathe...
As I count down, five, four, three, two, one.
Don't try to find a memory All at once.
Remember a piece, an element...
Of your wife...
And your life together.
Find your own internal guide and follow it.
Where would you like to go today?
Element.
Ginny!
Can you hear the sound of my voice?
It worked.
You were under about sixteen minutes.
It only felt like moments.
It's a different world there.
People are different, time is different.
This memory is a piece.
You build on that.
Can I come back?
Of course.
Morning, Beth.
Keep your head down, Carl is on the warpath.
Alan, hi.
Hey, how's your wife?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Um...
Right, right, I just wanted to check in about what we had talked about six months ago, I just...
No, no, no.
I understand, I hear what you're saying and... and I don't think you need to move this account.
I really don't.
I want you to feel like you can completely trust me again.
Ah, I'm better, I really am, I mean, I'm back.
That's why I wanted to call you today.
So, here is what's going on.
Yes, I did have a head injury, I got your "thank you" card,
I really appreciate it.
I'm back two hundred percent.
Trust me, if You'll just have a little faith in me, just have a little...
An ounce of faith in me, which I know you find hard.
I get it, I get that you're worried about me,
I get that you're worried about, you know, where we're going, I promise you, twenty-five percent.
I hear you, I need you to reconsider.
I just, I need you to think about this,
I mean, I, just listen to me, okay,
I know what I'm talking about.
Thank you, Mr. Wong.
Ah, yeah.
- How you feeling?
- I'm doing fine, doing fine.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about...
We're taking a different route, we got some new ideas, some emerging markets.
Look, let's have lunch?
I just don't think that's a good idea.
- Hey, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.
- No.
Albert, how's Hollywood?
Yeah, I know.
You can't do this to me Albert, I mean...
Hey man, it's Carl, call me back.
Three, two, one.
Element.
My wife.
This was the night.
I died shortly after this.
What happens after this?
Are you sure you're ready to remember?
Soon.
What was different this time?
When I'm under, it's real.
- I'm with her.
- But it's not real.
She's not really there.
You need to let her go.
I can't let go.
She says I'm not ready yet.
It's your mind that's not ready.
You need to be out, talking, meeting people...
Not isolating yourself.
Sometimes letting go of someone is how you find the answers.
If I let go, she'll be gone forever.
So, what's it like?
It's amazing.
It's like a dream you don't want to wake up from.
How did you get into it?
My wife died.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's a long story, but it's the only way
I can still feel close to her again.
Hmm.
How'd she die?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
I mean, she was shot.
That's terrible.
I just don't remember a lot from that night.
Hmm, maybe next time you're under you could ask her.
Guess I never thought about that.
- I should get going.
- Is it something I said?
No, you seem like a really nice guy, but you're still married.
That's not what I was...
I wasn't...
I wasn't trying to...
All right.
How are things at work?
Work is getting harder and harder.
There's a lot of pressure there.
My boss...
The guy who runs our department is riding me hard because of my memory issues.
We really haven't talked about these issues.
Why don't we discuss those next time?
I'm going to be late for work.
Remember...
I can't make you feel or do anything.
You don't lose your free will, you're always awake, always aware, and always in control.
Watch, as the other fingers fade away.
Breathe.
The count down...
Five, four, three, two, one.
Element?
Home.
I know I was wrong, I'm sorry.
I was overwhelmed.
Overwhelmed?
No, I mean, I wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.
No shit!
Who put you up to this?
- No one.
- You're lying, I know you.
You might have gone along with it, but you wouldn't have done it on your own.
I can get out of this.
Did you think about me;
About what it would do to us?
I did this for us!
Ginny, please...
As much as you want to keep seeing me, you know where this goes.
I don't see you here like this anymore.
You're going to have to remember on your own.
She's going to wake me up...
Please don't leave, stay with me.
You're going to come out, now.
How long was I out?
Fifty-seven minutes.
She was there with me at home.
It was after dinner the night she was killed.
You didn't make it home that night.
I tried to change it.
Hypnosis is a bridge between our conscious and our subconscious.
You can't create a memory to suppress another.
It's the easiest way to forget what's real and what isn't.
That's your last one, north.
At least somebody is looking out for me.
Tell me where it is!
Yeah, uh, no.
I'll call you back.
You're late.
- Traffic.
- And your phone is off.
There's so much shit going on around here for your phone to be off.
Sorry.
Andrex, where are you with that report?
I need those numbers.
I need access to those accounts.
They're our biggest client.
And we ought to be able to give them something.
Put them on hold.
Nothing's on hold.
It's been three months since you...
You know it's at risk if we don't give them something, right?
I can't remember, I'm trying.
Still seeing that woman, that shrink?
Of course.
How's that going?
I got to give them some reassurance.
I mean, they've been more than patient with us at this point.
But sooner or later, I got to pull the trigger.
So, you take some time off and you figure this out.
And I need to be able to call you on your phone if I need your help, okay?
I'm trying to be understanding here, but you need to get your shit together, for both of our sake.
- Look, if I could just...
- This is not a discussion.
Because with everything you know about this place, our clients and the people we work with...
I can't have you this fucking incomprehensible.
I will burn you if you don't give me what I want.
- No.
- Tell him where it is!
- Her!
- No, don't!
-
- They're going to come for you now.
This is unexpected.
I'm sorry to bother you, can I come in?
You didn't call to make an appointment.
I know but, it's...
Got bad today.
I didn't know where else to go.
I'm not seeing any other patients till this afternoon, but... you can't just show up like this in the future.
Understood.
Is there something you want to talk about?
Just put me under.
What do you want to find?
I want to go back to my wife, she was going to tell me something before I remembered the argument.
How did you meet Ginny?
We met at a work function when I got out of college.
I was working at a startup investment firm,
I went to one of the client's fundraisers
- and she was there.
- Love at first sight?
Yeah, it was.
We were...
Inseparable, got married six months later.
Things were good.
And then one day you wake up and look over...
And wonder how you got here.
- Did you argue?
- Sure.
What did you argue about most?
Money.
What else did you argue about?
Everything!
It's possible that this history of conflict has created a barrier.
There's only one way to find out.
Hear the sound of my voice.
I want you to open your eyes on one hundred, close on ninety-nine.
One hundred, ninety-nine.
Relax your breathing.
Feel the weight of your body leave you.
Element?
- My wife.
- Element?
I want to see her one more time, please.
I know you can answer me.
Element.
Revenge.
I know...
It doesn't make sense.
Did she have to die?
I need to see Ginny.
You have to take me to her.
Don't wake me up!
Take me to Ginny.
Don't wake me up!
No!
Holy fuck!
How long was I out?
Seventy-two minutes.
- That was...
- Intense!
Your memories are building.
When can I come back?
Let me get my appointment calendar.
No, no, no.
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
- So, what did they say?
- As if you don't know.
Come on, be more specific.
I can't remember anything.
Son of a bitch is running out of time.
I know, I'm working on it.
Don't tell me that.
I am gonna start wondering what your problem is.
If I ask one more time, we're going to make a lot of people nervous.
What do you want from me?
There is the other way.
Leave your cell phone on.
I'll be in touch.
Can I try a reposado, please?
Drinking alone?
- Looks like it.
- They say that's bad luck.
Who's they?
Thank you.
Do I know you?
Sorry, you just look really familiar to me.
- I'm Anna.
- North.
- North?
- Uh-huh.
I like it.
You from around here?
No, visiting.
- Family?
- Work.
Cheers.
What about you?
You live around here?
I do.
Married?
Ah, I was.
What do you do for work?
I was a financial Advisor.
- Was?
- Taking a break.
It's that bad?
Ask me again in an hour.
Probably won't be here in an hour.
I'm also in town to see my new therapist.
Is that bad to admit?
Of course not.
What kind of therapy?
Why?
You need somebody to talk to?
Maybe!
You ever heard of Ericksonian technique?
Yeah, I've heard of him.
My therapist is in his style.
I don't know, I may or may not see him again.
Did you call a cab?
Yes, thank you.
So, I have a couple of meetings in the morning.
I thought maybe we could grab a coffee after, and you could tell me more about this therapy I signed up for?
- Do I have a choice?
- No!
Don't forget.
You getting hers?
I guess so.
I want to speak to Ginny.
Based on your interaction with her in the trance world,
I'm not sure that's the best approach.
Why?
Have you ever kept a secret, really kept one...
Something about yourself you can't discuss?
The mind works the same way.
I don't understand.
Whatever secret your mind is hiding,
Ginny is not the one with the answers.
- It lies elsewhere.
- Then how do we find it?
I'd like to try a different technique to put you under.
A simple handshake.
Action learned as a single chunk of behavior.
Tying your shoelaces is another example.
When that action is diverted...
The mind responds by suspending itself in trance.
What is this?
- Element?
- Why did you bring me here?
What do you want me to see?
Take me back to my office.
I need to understand why the accounts were changed.
Element.
There's nothing else.
Tell me why you brought me here?
North!
North!
How long?
Nearly two hours.
You can't force your mind to travel places it doesn't want to go.
I came here to be with my wife.
Why can't she take me to her?
I don't know about can't, but she won't.
She has to.
No, I think it's like when you were a senior,
I was, like, potty training.
You probably don't even know who Elvis is, do you?
Oh, okay, nice.
Or we can talk about hypnosis some more.
Thank you for listening, seriously.
You're welcome.
I had fun today.
Me too.
It's been a while since I've been out.
With what, another woman?
Doesn't matter.
So, this is the infamous wall?
That's it.
What are the empty spots?
Those are of the things I've figured out.
Fascinating.
Well, it's a work in progress, but...
No, I meant you.
Hey!
You okay?
Yeah.
Where you headed?
Work, travel, home.
I'll be back.
When?
Soon!
Last night...
It was...
But...
It's too soon.
It's okay.
Disappointing, but it's okay.
Can I get a zip up, please?
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Are you starting to remember your wife's death?
I'm not sure I want to.
Would knowing be worse than what you're putting yourself through now?
I'm not going to tell you it's time to move on, but denying your memories, repressing them who you are, who you were...
I just think you're strong enough to handle it.
You don't know me.
Yeah, but...
I'm older and wiser, and I know that living in a dream world is a good way to lose sight of the real world.
That's exactly why I do it.
I get it, but it doesn't solve anything.
They're still... here.
There are seven billion people on this planet.
There are those of us that like ourselves and those that don't.
You accept it and you move forward.
I know what you're saying.
Do you?
I have to go.
Call me?
Can I help you?
You can't, he can.
We're in a meeting here.
Is that right?
Andrex, I'm finding things, this doesn't add up.
Add up?
You're a fucking nightmare, you know that?
What is this?
Excuse me.
This, this is cancer.
Now if we don't get a hold on this now, everything's blown.
And everybody is going down with this ship.
What are you telling me?
I'm asking you to do the right thing here.
Why are you changing their quarterly reports?
When the fuck did you become so soft?
Jesus!
You want me to cover this for you?
You want me to tell them their returns add up just fine?
They're not going to notice that while oil and gas prices rose, their royalty payments remained stagnant?
Keep your voice down.
You can't just Bernie Madoff this shit.
You're talking about millions of dollars, messing with signatures, fraudulent IRS documents and god knows what else, from andrex.
You know how powerful they are, are you fucking crazy?
You want to practice your babe in the woods routine, be my guest.
But how exactly do you think those numbers got turned around?
Ahh.
No, I didn't.
Yes, yes you did, partner.
Do you have access to those Cayman accounts now?
No, what accounts?
God damn it.
Find it.
Are you sleeping with him?
No, but it looks like I'm going to have to.
Hi, you've reached my voicemail, please leave a message.
Hey, it's me.
Ah, just calling to see if you're free to talk?
I had kind of a rough day, so just...
Could use someone to talk to.
Anyway, call me back.
Bye.
Joseph!
Carl!
What are you doing here?
Hmm.
I'm done playing games.
Please... don't!
Don't kill me!
Then talk to me.
It's on the jump drive.
What?
It's on the jump drive.
North hid it.
Come on, now, relax and enjoy it.
Relax now, come on.
Come on, now, relax and enjoy it.
Picture yourself descending a flight of stairs, counting each step down starting at ten.
As you take a step, feel the step under your foot.
Once you get to the last step, imagine and truly feel yourself stepping off into a relaxing pool of water.
Feel yourself falling down through the water deeper and deeper.
You should start to feel somewhat numb.
Your heart will start to race a bit.
Embrace it.
Just let the fears about your situation just drift away into the water.
Element?
You already know what I want, don't you?
Two hundred.
Yeah, I'm out.
Your 200...
And 400 more.
Let's see what you've got.
The bet's 600 to you, sir.
I'm out.
Fold.
Fold.
So... you really don't know who I am, huh?
Not a clue?
I don't know you.
That's right.
The shoe doesn't know me, I forgot.
Should I?
Maybe not.
Maybe, no.
Maybe not.
Hey, it's on you.
You going to talk or play cards?
You can piss off.
You like that?
Watch this.
You really don't get it, do you?
I was in Carl's office, but that's not where you would know me.
What the fuck!
You were the one.
They're going to come for you now.
What happened?
How did you...
- Why are you on the floor?
- How the hell did you do that?
- You need to go.
- Wait!
Shit!
Let me think.
There were others, strangers, I was attacked.
Hmm.
Did I hurt you?
How was I able to do that?
I don't know.
Just go!
She knew, she already knew where I wanted to go.
How is that possible?
I'm sorry.
Please, please, just help me understand!
I didn't agree to do this, just go!
I just want you All to just go away!
Get the fuck out of here!
Yeah, hello?
North?
It's Beth.
What's happened?
Carl Mackey, he killed himself.
They think he overdosed.
North?
North?
I'm a patient of hers.
Yes, she knows who I am.
Why won't she call me back?
I know you're an answering service, I get that.
Yes, this is an emergency, why do you...
Fine, just have her call me back, thank you.
God damn it!
North Maxfield?
Yes.
Can we talk for a moment?
What's this about?
Carl Mackey.
Interesting choice in decor.
Beth said that Carl killed himself.
Did he leave a note?
Depends on how you view that question.
Oh, now, that is an interesting note.
Found it stuck to his computer, so it's pretty new.
Do I need to get a lawyer?
I don't think so, but I have been known to be wrong from time to time.
Any idea what this note is about?
Not a clue.
Now, the interesting thing to me is the little argument you two had.
Now, the way I understand it from your colleagues, you bashed his face in his desk.
Now, if it were me, I would press charges, but I know how you investment types are at protecting each other from the outside world, while stabbing each other in the back.
It wasn't a big deal.
"Burn this motherfucker", doesn't sound like no big deal.
One guy has something on the other, stuff like this happens.
- Am I going to jail?
- Not today.
Where were you night before last?
Here, working.
- Anyone with you?
- No, no one was with me.
But I'm sure I made some calls from here.
Did you have any idea that Mr. Mackey was shooting up?
I mean, everyone said that he was acting edgy lately, but... but not strung out.
I wouldn't know.
I haven't spoken to him much lately.
Not since your wife.
I heard.
Listen, I need to get back to work.
So what did you have on him anyway, huh?
I think I'd like you to leave.
I mean, why are you getting so defensive?
I'm still dealing with the death of my wife.
Sarah!
Are you here?
What are you doing here?
- I need your help.
- I can't see you.
Please, I'm desperate.
That's exactly why I can't see you anymore.
What does that mean?
- You've become dependent.
- Dependent on what?
What did you expect by coming here?
I came here for help, to remember.
- To feel normal again.
- Do you?
Do you feel normal?
- That's not the fucking point.
- Answer the question.
- Do you feel normal?
- Not in a very long time.
I have headaches, thoughts of shit
I can't make sense of.
Nosebleeds?
You didn't tell me about that.
My nose bleeds, they're getting worse.
Those are side effects I'm talking about.
I puke into the garbage can every time I wake up from being asleep.
You've become addicted.
To hypnosis?
Are you kidding me?
Stop it!
Stop it!
No, no, no, no.
The truth you've been looking for, you've found it.
You just won't admit it.
Fuck you!
You know that, fuck you!
Fuck you.
Please!
Please, please, I'm sorry.
Please.
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
I won't put you under anymore.
They...
listen... they might be able to help you more than I could.
The other day you said something.
What did you mean when you said,
"you wanted us All to go away"?
He's close.
Picture yourself descending a flight of stairs.
Counting each step down.
Starting at ten.
Deeper, and deeper...
Element.
What's happening to me?
Is this the beginning or the end?
I'm sorry, I was traveling, I didn't call.
You said you would.
What happened to your face?
Who did this to you?
Can I come in...
Please?
What is this?
- Where are your band-aids?
- Bathroom.
- I called.
- I know you did.
My doctor won't see me anymore.
Why?
The last time I was under, I attacked her.
While you were in trance?
So, what has this have to do with your face?
There was a man after me.
He was chasing me with a gun, he gave me this.
Where, in your subconscious?
Just let me get to...
Tell me, how is that even possible?
So, you hurt yourself?
I went under, this wasn't there.
I came out and it was.
Okay, wait.
Who put you under?
- I did.
- When?
Tonight.
He finds me now.
He finds me and it's like he's trying to kill me.
But I feel like the answers are right there.
What can I do?
If these people are coming after you in your trance, that must mean something, right?
I think Ginny was a mistake.
I'm just...
I'm right there, I'm so close.
Why are you here?
I...
I don't know what you mean, I...
I mean, why did you come back?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
What if I do it, what if I put you under?
No.
What if I don't come out of it?
I won't let you go.
Mmm-mmm.
Okay.
How could you have done this?
Carl said we could get away with it.
These companies have hundreds of millions of dollars and tons of investments, they never realize their royalty payments were a little low.
I did this for us.
For us?
And that makes it okay?
And this woman you've been seeing, what about her, was she part of your plan?
I was afraid Anna was on to us, I had to find out.
North, wake up!
Why is she here?
Why is she here?
Where are you?
Who are you with?
What do you see?
Why did you bring me here, answer me?
No!
Anna!
Where are you?
You should have been here by now.
North?
Don't scream.
North, please!
- What are you doing?
- How did she know?
Answer me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
My wife!
She knew about you.
- How?
- She didn't.
How?
Answer me or I swear...
Tell me who sent you?
Stop this.
You are scaring me, please.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
I want you to give me the gun, okay.
Let me help you.
Oh!
You are a liar!
You're a liar.
I can explain, okay.
But if you hurt me, there are huge consequences.
You will never wake up from this.
I don't plan to.
Out, we're going out now.
She showed me where this ends.
North, you are losing it.
I know what's real and what's not.
Why did you ransack my place?
- I didn't, you're crazy.
- I don't believe you.
Stop it!
Who are you?
Who sent you?
No one sends me anywhere.
Get off of me.
I still can't believe you don't remember who I am.
Andrex, Anna andrex.
And you stole my money.
North!
Wait, wait.
Wait.
You're so late.
Well, it seems that the doctor has been playing both sides against the middle.
What?
Who?
Justice department.
Found this card at her place.
It's the same one that was on his wall.
I knew it.
I'm sorry.
Were you ever trying to help me?
Yes.
Please, north.
From the moment I met you, I knew you were a good man.
That was before.
I've done things.
I'm not who I was.
Yes, you are.
Ginny's gone.
You remember why now, don't you?
What happened?
Accept the truth, it's the only way out of this.
This is getting us nowhere.
Just wait.
Is she with us?
Is she here?
The money you stole, where is it stashed?
No, forget it.
Tell him where the money is.
What are you going to do...
Kill me?
No, her.
No, no!
You know what this makes you?
A witness.
I got her killed.
I got her killed.
If I had just told you, she'd still be here!
North, you won't hurt me.
Here's how this ends.
You give me back the money you stole, you do this for me and we All walk away.
You can have a fresh start.
You and your wife could have a fresh start.
This is your chance.
You're close to the numbers and you know them well.
You do this, we could talk about immunity from what you've done.
I will be with you through the whole process.
Think of me as your guide, I'm going to provide you All the elements you need.
I was getting out.
I was getting out.
Why didn't you come find me?
After the accident...
You lost it.
Your memory...
You were going to talk to Ginny about it that night and get back to her with an answer.
What are you talking about, get back to who?
His little angel in the justice department.
This...
This is All you want.
This is All they want.
This will destroy you.
What was on the drive?
Those are for you.
North, don't do this to me.
Ginny didn't have to die.

- [footsteps thudding] - [loud roaring]
- [dramatic music playing] - [panting] [chittering]
Trust me, I'm your friend.
[grunting]
[Chatter] Bawk!
Run for your lives!
[sirens blaring]
Finger five on it!
[roaring]
[grunting] [growling] [roaring]
Batter up, up!
- Up!
- [gulps]
Hit it outta the park, Kong!
[grunting] [gulping]
[sighs] You're not supposed to eat the pinecones.
You're supposed to bat them away with your new armbands.
[chuckles] Good luck with that.
This time of year, they're filled with pine nuts.
Kong loves 'em.
[grunting]
Yeah, but he's supposed to be learning how to defend himself against incoming blasts.
Got that, big guy?
[sighs] [grunting]
Okay, here it goes!
[laughing]
Looks like he's figured out how to do both.
[sighs] I think we need to keep practicing.
Maybe with something less tasty.
Oh, that reminds me!
Have you seen Anita?
She said she was gonna make us our favorite banana treats.
Guess that's why she needed to go into the city for more supplies.
- [phone beeping] - [grunting]
Oh!
Mi querida grandniece!
Hi, Francisca!
It's been so long!
Qué pasa?
[Panchi] I've been thinking... you know that I've been living with tia Maria since I was little.
[Anita] Of course.
That woman is an angel.
How is dear Maria?
She's good!
But, you know, I've always dreamed of working to save nature.
I wanna be like Lukas, rescuing endangered animals!
Okay, but... [gasping] Look!
Are you seeing this?
[Richard] I am indeed.
My brother may have impressive firewalls, but away from his home base, Anita's signal's coming in crystal clear.
Yes, eavesdropping on the elderly is the pinnacle of villainy.
You think I enjoy hearing this insipid babble?
I'll do anything to find a clue to where Lukas is hiding that hideous ape.
Anything.
[Anita stammers] Sí, very pretty bird.
[stammers] But now, what does tla Maria say about this?
She wants me to tell you... [gasps]
[screaming] [yelling] Francisca!
Francisca!
Now, this is a fortuitous turn of events.
By my calculations, that young girl would not agree.
That's because Anita's grandniece has no idea what an incredibly rare giant anaconda is worth on the black market.
Or better yet, what an incredible bionobot it could make!
I must get ahold of that snake!
Please, Lukas, if anything happens to Francisca, to my querida Panchi,
- I will never forget...
- Easy.
Try to relax, Anita.
Jonesy and I are going to find out what happened and make sure Panchi's okay.
These bizcochos are for when you find her.
They're Francisca's favorite, and she will probably be... [sobbing] hungry!
Batteries are fully charged.
Let's grab some sky!
We are totally on board with the idea.
Uh, forget it, Danny.
You two definitely have to stay home this time.
[whines]
Sorry, bro, but we don't have any way to get you there.
And besides, you're a fugitive, so you're supposed to be in hiding.
[grunting] [chuckles lightly]
That's the ticket, big guy!
Keep hiding, and we'll be back in no time.
[grunting]
Oh yeah, bud.
That's enough hiding.
[grunts]
Let's do it!
Just like we planned!
Keep up with 'em, Kong!
Whoa!
[alarm blaring]
What is it?
I don't know, but we're going down fast!
Hang on!
[both groaning] [sighs]
Okay, this can't be happening.
[both gasp]
Hey!
Lemme in!
Kong didn't want to be left behind, and you know how Kong gets when he makes up his mind.
Besides, you'll need Kong's muscle when you come up against that giant snake.
[grunting happily]
No!
It could be dangerous!
Anyway, how's Kong gonna fit inside this helicopter?
Come on!
You said you use this copter to airlift elephants to safety, so why not give Kong a lift?
Let's see... because he's heavier than ten elephants?
Jonesy can do it.
He's a techno-wizard.
[chuckles] Smooth schmoozing, kid.
Amping up the power's the easy part.
The flying ape part's a little trickier, but I think I've got something we can use back at camp.
Okay, let's make it fast!
[ratcheting]
This baby's on nice and tight.
I've loaded a backup battery, too.
All right, let's get going.
Okay, Kong!
Get ready, like we showed you!
[grunting]
[Lukas] This might tickle a little, bro.
[laughing]
[Danny] We have ape-nition.
[grunting]
[Jonesy] Usumacinta River's just up ahead.
Sure a lot of bald patches in the forest.
The scars of clearcutting.
The deforestation's probably what brought the anaconda this far north.
With their habitat shrinking, like the rest of the world's wildlife, the anaconda has to adapt or perish.
That's not fair.
Nope, but it's why we do what we do, Danny.
Rescue gear's ready.
Hey, this is new.
[chuckles] Yeah, little surprise I worked up.
Okay.
Triangulating on Panchi's holo-phone.
Signal says we're right on top of her.
Look!
It's the snake!
Man-o-man-aconda, it's a monster!
Okay, we've found the snake, but there's no sign of Panchi.
You don't think she's... inside the anaconda, do you?
[pterodactyl screeching]
We've got company.
[Jonesy] Richard's hot-bot must be after the anaconda.
[Lukas] But how did Richard know about it?
[roaring]
[roaring]
[Danny] Not fair!
Kong can't land a punch stuck on this helicopter!
Let's see if I can maneuver him into punching position!
Whoa!
[gasps] [pterodactyl screeching]
[roars]
[Lukas] Ha!
Just like the run-and-shoot offense we played in college!
[grunting] [grunts]
Yo, Lukas!
This would be a good time to try out my surprise!
[roaring]
Laser net.
Pretty cool, right?
Awesome tech, Jonesy!
I do love your surprises.
Well, here's one you won't.
We're running out of juice.
[Lukas] You better finish this fast, bro, before we lose it!
[grunting]
Okay, not what I meant, but...
sure, that works, too.
[Kong grunting] [faint screech]
[roaring]
[roars]
Let's see how your primitive monkey-mind deals with this.
[Botila grunts]
Apparently, far better than I calculated.
[roaring] [imitating Kong's roar] [laughs] All right!
The Kong-a-nator scores!
[shouting] Panchi!
Panchi!
[device crackling]
Guys... her holo-phone signal is coming from inside the anaconda.
[hissing]
Oh, no!
[grunting]
[Panchi speaking Spanish]
She doesn't want you to hurt the snake.
[chuckles] Ah, Panchi!
[speaking Spanish] [laughs] Hola, Lukas!
[speaking Spanish] [grunts] She's cute.
Too bad she doesn't speak English.
Too bad you don't speak Spanish.
Huh?
Uh, yeah, but I can speak Chinese!
[speaking Mandarin]
Okay, so do you.
But I can talk to the animals!
That's awesome, Dr. Dolittle.
[chuckles] I just wanted to talk to mi tia abuela, but the snake ate my phone.
Anita, I've got some great news.
Francisca, is she all right?
Uh... so, is your name Panchi or Francisca?
Both.
Panchi is my nickname.
Hola, tia Anita!
Thanks for sending Lukas!
Francisca!
Oh, thank heavens!
[Chatter] Bawk!
Happy dance!
Oh, you beautiful child!
I was so worried!
What were you thinking?
You could have been eaten!
I need to have a word with tia Maria about keeping a better eye on you!
That's what I was starting to tell you.
We've been talking it over, and tia Maria agrees it's time for me
- to come and live with you.
- Qué?
You know it's my dream to work with Lukas saving animals.
Sí, but...
Tia Anita, you always promised when I was old enough,
I could come to the US and be with you.
I am ready!
She has my vote.
I think Panchi would make a great addition to the team.
Please...
Oh, come and be with me, my little spider monkey!
I have missed you so much!
I will see you soon, Francisca!
- Keep her safe, Lukas.
- Promise.
[speaking Spanish] [roaring]
Step away from the snake and no one gets hurt!
[roaring] [roaring]
Whoa!
[Kong grunting]
[grunting]
[Kong groans] [grunting]
[grunting]
Those dinosaurs are going to crush Kong!
Wow, I can't believe I just said that.
Isn't there something we can do to help him?
I know how you feel, but give him a minute.
The big guy usually works it out.
[grunting]
[Brag groans]
[roaring]
[Wheeler chuckling] Yeah!
You and your stinkin' ape are gonna fry!
We've got to put out this fire!
[roaring] [both] Kong, turn on the waterworks!
Ha!
Should've known you invented the game with him.
[both] Now, blow, bro!
[Danny] You did it, Kong!
[Lukas] Good job!
Pleasure doing business with ya...
losers!
[laughs] Whoa!
[Danny] They got the anaconda!
[roaring]
[laughing]
Okay, team, let's get out of here and start figuring out how we're gonna save that snake... before my brother sells it on the black market... or worse!
[Panchi] Your helicopter needs a tune-up.
[Danny] Did you just diss our ride?
[Jonesy] Afraid it's gonna be slow going until the backup battery recharges.
[Richard] The bionics I inserted into the anaconda are responding perfectly.
I'd say the procedure went extremely well.
Of course.
I was assisting.
I now have complete control over the anaconda.
So now we can put on the finishing touches.
My new super-forged titanium armor will make this next generation bionobot unbeatable.
You hope.
How about I test it out on... you!
Not amusing.
On the contrary. [laughs]
But enough fun.
Any minute now, my righteous brother and his ape will attempt to rescue the anaconda.
- [rumbling]
- Speak of the... [alarm blaring]
Confirmed.
Kong and company are on the island.
Time to have my snake wrap things up.
[roaring] [hissing]
[groaning]
[grunts] You two stay put!
[groaning]
What has Richard done to that poor creature?
Whatever it is, it wasn't part of the plan.
[grunting]
Sic it to him, Kong!
You seem amazingly calm, like this happens all the time.
[scoffs] Pretty much.
Whoa!
Loco.
What could be better than remote-controlled revenge?
[grunting] [groaning]
[Lukas] Kong's trying not to hurt the snake, but he can't take much more.
Nail him with the laser net!
But I can't net the anaconda without getting Kong!
[both grunt]
Botila, get the dinosaurs to take care of my brother and his companions while I enjoy my victory.
Yes, master.
Incoming!
On it!
[Jonesy] Gotcha!
[Jonesy grunts]
Hmm.
I have five times your strength.
Could it be you enjoy the beatings I administer?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Care to go another round?
Why not?
- Not...
Not...
Not...
- [electricity crackling]
Hope you don't mind my saving you from yourself.
[groaning]
Your prize monkey's about to go down, Lukas.
Even with his grotesquely large mouth, he's bitten off more than he can chew.
"More than he can chew..."
That snake's really zapping Kong!
Too bad he can't zap her back.
[exclaims] That's it!
Help me with Jonesy's backup battery.
[Danny grunting]
Wow, this thing weighs a ton!
[Panchi] Lift with your knees!
Jonesy, we're gonna try to get the snake to eat this.
Genius!
[groaning]
She'll be okay, right?
There's just enough volts to give her a good jolt so we can net her.
- [grunting]
- Kong, feed her this!
Like this, Kong.
See?
What?
No!
Don't eat that!
[electricity crackling] [screaming] No!
[sighs]
Great work, kids.
[Jonesy] Yeah, but how am I gonna get the chopper in the air without a battery?
[laughs] I'm just playing with y'all!
I got a backup.
This is one heavy snake.
We'd better lighten the load.
Danny, take Panchi and head home with Kong.
Jonesy and I will net the snake and meet you there.
[Danny] You cool, Panchi?
- You're not scared, are you?
- [Panchi laughs] No way!
I'm just sorry it took me so long to join the team!
Oh, mi querida!
Oh, my darling child!
Oh!
I am never letting you go!
[straining] Gracias, tia, but you hug tighter than the anaconda.
There.
That's the last of it.
We can reverse-engineer this tech and maybe get some insight into your brother's scientific methods.
I'm afraid Richard's seriously starting to lose it.
He certainly has lost sight of his humanity to do such a thing to this beautiful creature.
Chopper's fully recharged and ready to go.
Okay, then let's get this girl back to Mexico before the anesthesia wears off completely.
We'll have to relocate her somewhere Richard and his hench-bots won't find her.
By the way, I managed to retrieve your phone.
A little worse for wear, but it's still working.
Thanks, Amy, and...
Aw, gross!
[laughs] That's nothing.
- Right, Kong?
- [laughing]
Snot alert!
Take cover!
[all clamoring] [laughing] Welcome to Kong's world!
[laughing]
You rang?
Lukas succeeded tonight, but that trick will never work again.
From now on, I'm shielding all my bionic power sources [muffled] from that sort of overload.
Starting with you, Botila.
[whirring]
Of course I want children.
Just not yet.
I have to earn my position.
Sir Robert Peel will be Prime Minister one day.
You're not in danger from a harmless flirtation with a married woman.
I wanted to tell you I will be going back to Coburg shortly.
I find myself thinking about you when I'm at my sugar work.
I must congratulate you, sir.
That was a fine speech.
The only way to avoid...conception is...abstinence.

Georg Friedrich Handel.
German.
Are you all right?
It's nothing.
I am bilious.
Quickly!
Her Majesty is quite the little jack-in-the-box.
Women are queer cattle.
Of what do you gentlemen speak?
The music, sir.
It is very...well-constructed.
I felt unwell.
It was disagreeable.
It's over now.
Oh, Lord.
It was nothing compared to the spectacle of Peel perspiring with the effort of being charming.
Although I have to admit, I'm strangely drawn to Peel.
He's...direct.
Like me.
And also, I'm told he's an aficionado of the railway.
Don't talk railway at me.
Half the people in this box are moaning about incursions on their property.
They are wrong.
We stand on the brink of a modern revolution, Victoria.
Of science.
Embrace it.
Go to these places of new manufacturing.
You say manufacturing and my soul shrivels with boredom.
Mine does not.
You should be the champion of what is coming.
Rather too much "should".
You're tired.
I'm not tired.
Then, my dear...you must be ill.
I'm not ill.
I shall send for the doctor.
Albert, I don't...
I don't want a doctor.
Your Queen is sick.
Oh, we don't say "sick".
We say "indisposed".
Well, she is "indisposed" out of her mouth.
What's that?
The cure for every ailment known to woman... ..chocolat.
Hot chocolate?
Really?
Ah, ah, ah...
Mm!
Why don't you give her one of your little wafers to dip in?
You're in the wrong job, Miss Skerrett.
Thank you.
I'll get this to the Queen directly.
Can't fix what she's got with chocolate.
She says, "No doctor", then she sends for the doctor...
Goodbye, Doctor Clark.
What did the doctor say?
Tell me, please.
There's nothing we cannot face.
There is no...polite English word.
You are with child?
That's...
That's magnificent.
You are magnificent.
I'm afraid.
No.
Is it safe to announce?
I know my duty.
Very good, Lord Chamberlain.
HRH didn't dilly-dally.
Ma'am.
What is it?
Brandy mixed with cream.
It eliminates nausea.
Is it medically demonstrable?
Ask any woman who has conceived.
Listen to me.
Your nurse is a virgin, your husband is a man, your doctor is a fool.
Directly after luncheon you must go to bed, lay down on your back without moving till dinner.
Dinner shall be preparations of the vital organs.
The brain, liver, the lungs.
Affairs of state...
Drina, this is your affair of state.
Affairs?
Let Albert do them for you.
Let him do everything for you.
Will he also give birth for me, Mama?
Remember Charlotte.
Her death in labour is the reason you're Queen.
I've work to do.
Baroness, you put me off my stroke.
The Queen must have sweetbreads in broth.
I know, yes, I'll see to it directly, but if I cock this mayonnaise...
Her Majesty's dietary requirements take...
Curdled!
All she had to do was look at it.
Take this.
Make it again.
No.
I'm not an imbecile.
I grasp that the constitution demands an heir
I grasp that the constitution and that I must produce it, but... to make me feel I own no other function...
Your mother is er... ..of her generation.
The world is leaving her behind.
She's afraid.
You are going to look at my body and be revolted.
I...
I know it.
My desire for you will never fail.
A love like ours can burn down a city.
The Lord Chamberlain, Your Majesty.
My Lord.
This is my private time.
Speak freely before the Prince.
I shall be offended if you don't.
The court rejoices in your news.
But?
Your eyes are full of "but".
Childbirth is a hazardous business.
You want to know what will happen if I die.
I understand.
It is your duty to consider what would happen next.
Specifically, ma'am, if the child survived you.
It is incumbent upon Your Majesty to nominate a Regent for the approval of Parliament.
Well, that, my Lord, is something I can do without a moment's hesitation.
And so the torpid Teuton wedges himself yet further into the sagging cleft of power!
It's unconscionable!
If the Queen dies, are we to be ruled by a German?
We already are.
Cumberland would crawl over broken glass for a crack at the Regency.
Parliament, of course, must ratify.
Of course it must.
I hear you are already acquainted with the Prince, Peel.
The Queen is stubborn.
You must convince Albert to reconsider.
If the Tories fail to condone your Regency... ..I will abdicate.
No, you will not.
I will.
You can't abdicate.
You're not the monarch.
You can't abdicate.
Then I will merely leave.
Then I will merely kill myself.
Then I will remarry.
Ridiculous!
Who will you marry?
Wellington?
Peel?
Maybe both.
Cumberland shall be my mistress.
Drina...
Laughter is bad for baby.
One day, I'll put her on a donkey and pack her off to Carlisle.
Carlisle?
County town of Cumberland.
Celebrated for textiles.
Adjacent is Northumberland, rejoicing in the digging of coal.
You see, it is not your mother you should be sending north.
You're determined to see me dragged around some morbid display of traction engines.
Send me.
Why?
Otherwise I feel the people may not accept me as their Regent.
I'm not dead yet.
Don't be childish.
If you would prefer not to be Regent when I am dead...
No, what I would prefer, Victoria, is to exercise just a little power while you are alive.
Power must be seen to come from me.
For you...
I order a trip north.
An expedition into the dark heart of the Tory Shires where I shall fanfare you as Regent.
Oh, no.
I do not seriously expect you to travel.
The latest research in Germany suggests a woman in pregnancy should not exert herself.
But I am not a German woman.
I am the Queen of England.
Chillington Hall, ma'am, is well situated for your research, being in Staffordshire.
It is also close to Drayton,
Sir Robert Peel's residence.
Oh, Lord.
Your host, Sir Piers Giffard, is, by all accounts, an old-fashioned gentleman and a Tory as well.
But he begs to receive Her Majesty and her entourage.
Contrary to general belief, I'm not actually frightened of Tories.
Can we define "entourage"?
King Charles I, ma'am, made such excursions with what he called his "modest night bag".
with what he called A company of 500 horse.
Not an easy guest!
One is anxious not to end one's reign as did King Charles.
We shall be attended by a very few.
Jenkins.
Your Royal Highness?
Oh, erm, Lohlein is all I require.
Baroness, you, of course.
Can't travel without my dear Lehzen.
Surely, dear, Baroness is needed here to administrate...
Penge can administrate the household.
It's what he's for.
We shall be so light, we shall travel like the wind.
No, Mama.
You shall remain here.
Harriet, you attend to the Duchess in my absence.
Can your husband spare you?
He will not notice I'm gone, ma'am.
This, apparently, is the very discomfort the railway eliminates.
The vehicle runs on wheels which have...flanges,
I learnt this word, which fit precisely into the inner tracks...
I think we need to stop.
Please, stay here.
Why do you grab me with that, Lehzen?
It doesn't appear to be raining.
It was...in case Your Majesty was indisposed.
Oh, dearest Lehzen.
Always thinking of me.
I just needed some air.
You know, the whole world would have me trussed up in bed all day.
It's hardly my style, is it?
What was it you used to say I was?
A little wrigglepants, ma'am.
Did you see those fellows in the field?
They were surveying the railway, I think.
My darling, railway is not a subject to be paraded before the Giffards.
Just be your charming self.
They will adore you.
Last time I saw her she was, what, this high?
Apparently she still is.
She's here to pimp for his Regency.
Are you randy for it?
Not at any price.
Your Majesty.
Sir Piers.
So how does one pass one's time in Staffordshire?
Ceramics.
It is the industry of the region.
It is a-a-a favoured occupation of the people.
Well, it seems to be the case that many artefacts are created en masse in the factories.
I would very much like to visit some of these places.
We hunt, ma'am.
In fact, I've arranged for you and the Prince to ride out with the Shifnal tomorrow.
Piers, you're quite mad.
Her Majesty cannot tax herself to ride with the hounds in her condition.
Alas, I do not hunt.
I shoot.
A day of driven shooting, then.
Would Your Majesty find such a prospect diverting?
Excessively diverting.
We shall observe, Lady Beatrice.
I'm confident neither of us shall find the experience taxing.
Your man's shooting tomorrow.
Does he have the kit?
Hm.
In this country, a gentleman don't set foot in the field without the kit.
Just see me afterwards.
Crikey, whose are those?
The butler gave these to me for the Prince.
Is correct English for the field.
Those trousers aren't proper kit for nothing but fancy dress.
A gun wearing white would be a right howler.
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening?
Yes.
A dark coat.
Brown boots.
Tall hat.
The older the better.
That's all you need.
No-one shoots in nothing new.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Come on, show me what you've brought.
I won't have the Prince embarrassed.
What are those gentlemen doing?
They're the beaters, sir.
They're driving the birds towards us.
I see.
In Thuringia, we take birds in cages to high towers.
And then they are released.
What a barbaric practice.
Sausage-eater can hit 'em!
A most singular man.
Fascinating.
I "wipe your eye", Sir Piers.
Well shot, sir.
Oh.
Extraordinary to find you here.
Oh, extraordinary only in that I do not shoot, Your Majesty.
But I am neighbour to the Giffards.
You do not shoot?
If you instruct me to do so, ma'am, I shall certainly try but I am afraid I shall make a fearful hash of it.
Sport is not my metier.
I am unused to it.
Too busy preparing for government.
Now, luncheon.
Sir Piers, what is your view of the railway?
Fortunately, sir, I don't have a view of it here.
I'm plagued by people wanting to run the thing through my park.
I tell them to cut along sharpish or I'll set the dogs on 'em.
He's a fan, mind.
You approve of it, Sir Robert?
One must not stand in the path of progress, sir.
I agree.
I believe the railway dissolves the unnecessary cultural divides of our region.
Men can travel for work.
Families unite.
When you say..."our regions", sir, do you mean the counties of England?
Because you may find that the people of, for instance, Staffordshire, are rather fond of the peculiar virtues of their region and don't necessarily want it disfigured by iron rails.
As ever, this subject makes men overstimulated.
Am I right in thinking you have never seen a locomotive, sir?
That's correct.
Well, there is presently one on my property at Drayton.
It is quite adjacent.
It would be my pleasure to offer you all a demonstration.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Victoria?
Alas, Sir Robert, I think we should let our host devise the programme of activity.
Your Majesty is pale.
It is too silly of us to expect you to remain at table.
So fatiguing...
I am quite well, thank you.
..when baby is being mischievous.
Would you care to rest, ma'am?
I think I shall explore.
Alone.
You count as alone.
To look up over one's stew and see Peel fidgeting with the silver and simpering over my husband...
Albert doesn't know how to talk.
He refuses to dissemble.
He only ever says exactly what he means and amongst people like the Giffards, it's...
..hopeless.
Oh, say something, Lehzen.
You're allowed to say something.
Sir Robert reminds me of an exhibit I saw in Salzburg.
It was a big frog.
Stuffed.
You accuse Sir Robert of looking like a stuffed frog?
Now listen to me, Peel.
I know you've had disappointments in your life.
Harrow, so forth.
But the future belongs to the Tories and the Tories belong to you.
Coast to the port, damn you.
So make yourself fit for us.
In what respect am I not fit?
You pander to the railway when you should be chasing the bastards off your land.
You poodlefake and pussyfoot about the gormless German.
It's perfectly clear why they've invited themselves here.
Only reason he talks to you is to ginger up support for his Regency.
An office you shall not allow him.
Wellington's not too old to take the reins, you know.
Just saying.
You imagine I resent being left here by the Queen.
Well, you are correct.
It's never nice being left behind, Duchess.
Did you make that just for me?
Well, you are now my official taster.
That's extraordinary.
You know what would make that even better?
Here we go.
Cover it in hot chocolate.
I think, Miss Skerrett, you might be a genius.
Forgive me, darling, but... ..sometimes you're too direct when you speak.
Men like Giffard, they recoil from enthusiasm.
They find it un-English.
Please, from now on, let me guide the conversation.
I'm sorry about the locomotive.
But we must proceed carefully.
Speak English.
I have this morning sent a note to Sir Robert Peel.
Today, I see the locomotive.
Albert?
That is the most magnificent thing I have ever seen.
Good day.
Your Highness.
Morning.
Would you show His Royal Highness the controls, please?
These levers control the valves.
Pedal engages the eccentrics.
Regulator controls the motion.
Moderates the flow of steam.
Let's go.
Now, please, Your Worships, you can take a seat in the carriage.
Carriage be damned.
We ride here.
I said I wished to be alone.
Shall I go, Majesty?
No.
You haven't eaten your beetroot, ma'am.
I can't bear this.
Where is he?
This is the future!
Yes, sir.
How is the Queen?
Wanting the most peculiar things for breakfast.
This morning she had to have beetroot, a vegetable.
It's revolting.
She's rather cross that HRH has gone off somewhere without her.
Also without me, but... ..for a man, it is essential to have space.
To breathe.
It's not only men who need a breather from matrimony, my dear.
Er, the butler said that in the country the Prince must sing as he's being undressed.
I am to encourage this.
Sing?
Yes.
Anything in particular?
God Save The Queen.
Good heavens.
You've been had, boy.
This butler wants your master to look a fool.
Why?
Because these people like the Giffards and their servants, they're all the same.
Got to keep the old ways.
Anything that is young and new is a threat.
The Queen, the Prince, you.
You're what's next.
You scare them.
I'm going for a walk.
Without the Prince?
Sir Piers.
Ma'am?
As we are presently unencumbered by other guests, may I ask where you stand on the matter of the Regency?
This is surely a matter, ma'am, that is purely hypothetical?
Parliament is not hypothetical.
Its members must condone my selection.
Condone or condemn.
What would you advise them to do?
What all men of honour must do, ma'am.
What all men of honour must do, Follow their consciences.
Weasel.
Sir Robert, do you consort with me because you seek my favour for your political advantage?
No, sir.
Do you consort with me because you seek my influence to ratify your Regency?
No.
Although that would be rather helpful.
Perhaps I should.
I like you, Sir Robert.
You know I famously have no taste, of course.
I'm German.
There it is.
I am glad of it, sir.
There it is.
Does your hand contain royalty?
As a matter of fact, it does.
A prince?
Of course, I mean knave.
Ernest is not an honest man, Harriet.
I'm a married woman, Duchess.
You've got children.
As I had Victoria.
How dare you.
My dear, I did not want to wake you.
It is such an insult.
It's not an insult, Victoria.
It was merely me embracing England's destiny on your behalf.
It is not your place to do things on my behalf!
If I wish to bring railways, or anything, to the attention of the English people, then, Albert, I shall do it myself!
And if you answer back using the word "future", I shall scream!
I decide what is the future.
What if you had been killed?
Do you not care at all about our unborn child?
Look at you.
You look like a peasant.
I'm not the one eating beetroot.
What?
What is wrong with beetroot?
It's peasant food.
That is ridiculous!
Possibly in your country, not in mine...
This is my country!
Victoria, I seek only to serve it.
And yourself.
Dining with the Queen, Mr Francatelli?
Where's the Queen?
She didn't shed a rod, her wheels didn't fall off... ..and she didn't kill Prince Albert.
I call it a success.
Your blooming good health, boys.
Good health.
Oh, Christ.
Victoria!
Victoria!
You like it?
I love it!
What?
I said I love it!
Now.
It's wonderful.
You know what you ought to do?
Call it...a bomb surprise.
Because it looks like a bomb, yeah?
And it's a surprise!
La bombe surprise.
Mr Francatelli's bombe surprise.
You invented it.
No, you invented it.
We invented it.
It won't wash, Peel.
What won't, Sir Piers?
Licking up to the Queen's husband and giving him a ride on your ruddy infernal machine.
It is not an adult way to solicit power.
The Prince has no power to be solicited.
Oh, you're wrong.
With respect.
You know, Sir Piers, I rather enjoyed riding on the railway.
I commend the experience to you.
You might find it enlightening.
I am most grateful for Your Majesty's advice.
It is a mistake to make one's mind up about a thing before one's tried it.
Don't you think?
The world is on the move, Sir Piers.
Keep up.
My darling.
Whatever is the matter?
I am frightened of the pain.
There will be pain, yes, but...
I wish I could endure it for you.
But, Victoria, listen to me.
Listen...
You are strong.
Childbirth is surely an ordeal, but you are equal to it.
You have such...such fortitude.
It was wrong of me.
Peel.
The engine.
To go alone.
No, not...not necessarily.
You will allow me to share the burden of your duties?
Albert... ..please.
The Scots, you know, they...
they have a curious expression.
"Softly, softly, catchee monkey."
Who is this monkey?
You are my monkey.
Did you see the Giffards sniggering up their noses at me?
My dear, you look so well.
Thank you, Mama.
Expeditions clearly agree with us.
I am afraid I didn't drink your medicine.
The baby will tell you what it wants.
Welcome home.
Are we paying attention?
The Queen has requested a dish of bacon and peas.
Is bacon suitable?
Medical suitability has been suspended.
Bacon, Mr Francatelli.
And peas, Mr Penge.
And peas.
Post-haste.
And for the Prince?
The Prince dines with the Queen.
Double bacon and peas!
It is Her Majesty's wish that her husband be Prince Regent and I believe it is the correct choice.
You promote the costive Coburg as our Regent?
I do not promote the Prince.
The man is a menace and a boor.
I endorse the decision of my Queen.
If you wish to make farmyard noises,
I suggest you cross the floor to Palmerston's sty where that species of behaviour is tolerated.
This is the party of gentlemen.
Is that understood?
Let the Speaker be informed that the Tories wholeheartedly support Her Majesty's choice of Regent.
There it is.
Well, if none of us has the moral courage to stand up to Peel,
I...
I suggest we back him.
Is that understood?
The frog is here.
Wishing to croak at you.
I shall send him away.
No.
Tell Sir Robert I shall be pleased to see him.
Your Majesty.
Sir Robert.
You look rather more at home here than you do in a muddy field.
It's late.
This must be important.
It is indeed, ma'am.
I beg to inform Her Majesty that in the unfortunate event of her death, her selection of Regent has the full support of the Tory party.
That is encouraging news.
But quite academic.
As you see, I am far too busy to die.
Cotton.
Whereabouts is cotton mostly?
Manchester.
Yes.
Rather more your sort of thing than mine.
Most of this contains industry.
I'm so bored of this.
Surely you cannot believe a senior member of the British Royal family would contemplate regicide?
A harmless flirtation is what you called it.
You have your freedom.
Don't give it up for a man.
Am I simply a vessel to be protected because I am carrying precious cargo?
It's my duty to show myself to my people.
It's too dangerous.
It's starting.

Okay, everyone.
Uh, I'd like you to meet Brett.
Brett and his family just moved here from Berlin, so let's give him a great, big St. Barklay's willkommen.
Uh, we're from Berlin, New Jersey, actually.
Oh.
Well, that's still foreign to me.
[Light laughter]
Okay, have fun.
Hi.
Kenny.
So excited to be working with you.
It's actually really hard to meet another baritenor who can soar over the notes, you know?
We're rare, like four-leaf clovers.
And sociopaths.
Actually, sociopaths aren't as rare as you might think.
Cool.
Anyway, uh, when my mom calls for "mezzo piano,"
what she really means is "mezzo forte,"
which can be mezza-confusing.
That's really funny.
I don't get it.
Who are you?
Um, my...

I should have listened to Shannon.
She's the expert on gifts.
She's been up in her room for hours working on Ethan's present.
What's she getting him?
She won't tell me.
But apparently, it's something he can't get from anyone else but her.
[Chuckles]
What?
Last time I said that to a guy, it meant sex.
What?

[Scoffs] No.
She's too young.
She's 15.
That's old enough.
I mean, for a permit, maybe a quinceañera.
- I lost my virginity at that age.
- You did?
Yeah, and I was a late bloomer.
But I did make up for it in college.
Not that I became a slut, I just dated a lot of guys.
And a professor, which got weird.
I mean, I deserved the "F,"
but not the restraining order.
God, I miss her.

Great job, everyone, and I want you to rest those voices at home.
I don't care if your loved one passes out in front of you.
You are to make to make that 911 call whispering.
And these are to keep your pipes lubricated for tomorrow when my M... mm...
Choirmaster O'Neal gives us her final evaluations.
Jodi... tea.
Allison... tea.
Bill... tea.
Brett... double latte, whipped cream, extra milk.
Uh, pass on the phlegm-uccino.
Isn't dairy bad for the pipes?
Is it?
I'm not as challenged mentally as you are vertically.
What is your problem?
Me?
I'm not the one who's been trying to undermine me for the past week.
And what about you?
I mean, you practically rode a Harley into the choir room and didn't laugh at my jokes, which are amazing and reflect my unique world view.
And don't forget your unnatural obsession with the limelight.
Oh, please.
You love it, too.
If I'm told to stand in the front, I stand in the front.
I can't help it if I look good there.
Okay, then what is your thing, Brett?
I mean, you must have a flaw, otherwise you would have gone out of your way to make friends in a new church as opposed to being an aloof jerk.
I mean, I'm a likeable person!
Why don't you like me?

That's the problem, you idiot.
I do like you.

Oh.
I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me you were gay?
Do you like avocados?
Obviously.
They're good fats.
Why didn't you tell me you like avocados?
Okay, yeah.
I see your point.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not closeted or anything,
I just don't go around announcing that I'm into dudes.
Yeah, me, neither.
It's so tacky.
I'm gay!

I'm gay, I'm not European.
Yeah, sometimes the moment calls for it.
I'm sorry I was so standoffish.
I was crushing on you, and I totally overcompensated.
Well, we all have ways of protecting ourselves, right?
Look, the only reason I joined the choir was to meet you.
And I didn't plan on getting the solo, and I certainly didn't intend to come between you and your mom, who you do talk about a lot.
- Yeah.
- So, I'll quit.
What?
No.
Yes.
This competition clearly means more to you than it does to me.
And I'd like to stick around.
So I get the solo and the guy.
It really is a Christmas miracle!
Don't get on that bus!
It's eight minutes away.
Dad, what are you doing here?
I...

I can't let you have sex with Ethan.
I mean, sex is awesome, and I know you probably don't want to hear that right now...
- I don't.
- But you need to.
And look, I can't stop you from having sex, but I can ll you that it will affect the rest of your life.
And if you decide to wait,
I promise you will not regret moving too slow.
But if you go too far too fast, you can't go back in time.
Okay, take a breath.
I'm not having sex with Ethan.
Oh, thank God.
Well, then, what are you doing?

I'm going to his house to give him his present.
Which is sex!
Or... a diorama of us at the Natural History Museum.

So I created a milieu of us looking at us looking at us.
And that's why he couldn't get it from anyone else but you.
But then why all the showers?
I got glue in my hair from making the miniatures.
So whatever you thought I was doing... gross.
Sorry, honey.
W-Why didn't you stop me from saying all of that?
You were on a roll.

Ow!
It was Sheila DeMars!
Okay, I offered her terrible things in exchange for my silence, but she made me film you.
By the way, you sleep with your eyes open.
I don't think that's normal.
You taped everything with the camera facing the wrong way.
There's nothing on here but hours and hours of your nostrils.
Oh, this is the best news ever!
Mm.
I am sorry I wronged you, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you are right...
Episcopalians are wily and highly sexual.
Well, you're not done with them yet.
I want you to go back to Sheila DeMars and tell her that we are doing "The Little Drummer Boy."
- But you're not.
- Exactly.
I want to throw her off.
Now, is there anything else I need to know before I lead our choir to victory?
Um...
Oh, did you hear Brett quit?
No.
No, I did not hear that.
Kenny... just who I wanted to see.
Will you hold this nail for me?
I'd rather not.
You made Brett quit the choir, and now we have zero chance of winning.
Gee, thanks for that vote of confidence.
Maybe if you believed in me from the beginning, none of this would have happened.
You wanted him to join just as much as I did.
Right, but you care more about winning than your family.
Jimmy is out there spying for you...
Sweet, sweet, simple Jimmy.
That's how low you stoop.
Oh, excuse me, you wanted to give someone bronchitis.
You wanted to kick Allison out!
And you agreed with me!
Remember, when we were on the same page?
You know what, I admit it.
I don't think this contest has brought out the best in either of us.

Randall, wake the hell up.
You almost put a chemo pill in your shake.
Oh.
Uncle Kevin, why are you writing in your book?
Play, sweetheart.
It's a play, and the director wants me doing scene work.
You seem to be doing a lot of writing.
Well, I seem to be getting a lot of direction, William.
Tell you what.
You got a great voice.
You ever do any voice-over work?
Well, you should.
Really.

Not sure why I would take offense to that.

It's the texture of the skin, it's gross.
Yeah.
I don't want blueberries either.
Yeah.
Understood.
Uh, any other dietary restrictions
I should let the staff know about?
No, man.
You're busy.
I'll just, you know,
I'll make a list for you later when I get some time.

You need to put something in your stomach, William.
Toast, pills, juice.
That's the order.
Okay?
Is that medicine?
Do you have a cold, grandpa?
Grandpa's fine.
No.
They're just vitamins.
So.
You, uh, told the girls that he's grandpa, but not that he's sick.
Right?
That's ballsy.
Hey, so, Kevin, uh, it's been a few days now, you know, since you showed up.
Without calling.
Right.
And... and it's great to see you.
I was just sort of wondering...
How do I say this politely?
When are you leaving?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
No, I mean, come on.
I can, I...
I can, um...
I can get out of here whenever.
I just...
I...
I saw this as an opportunity to hang with you two, you know, and the girls, but, uh...
Plus I... honestly, this play, guys, it's kicking my ass a little, you know?
Mm.
And it's so lonely at that hotel.
I mean, I got this big suite all to myself but I guess the bigger the hotel room, the emptier it can feel.
You know?
I'm sitting there.
I got that 800 thread count sheets.
I got the endless minibar snacks.
You got the fancy oatmeal soaps, plush robes and all i can do is sit there and think about how...
Quiet it is.
We'll take it.
What's that?
Uh, the hotel.
Beth and I, we'll take it, tonight.
No, Randall.
Where are we gonna get a sitter?
No, we got two family members oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Living in our house for free.
One of them played a nanny on TV.
No.
No, actually, an au pair.
Technically, I played an au pair on TV.
There's a difference.
A lot of people don't know that.
I was... an au pair.
They were gonna call the show, whataupair,but the ...

I'm-a go pack.
Okay.
I'm-a go pack right now.
Wait.
Good morning.
Hey.
Hi.
Breakfast in bed?
Yeah.
What did I do to deserve this?
I don't know.
You've done a lot of really nice things for me, so I wanted to return the favor.
Oh.
By cutting up cardboard into little squares and putting it in a bowl?
Those are cheese squares.
Oh, yum.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What's on top?
Oh, hemp seed.
Hemp seeds on top?
Mm-hmm.
Boy, you really buried the lede.
Now I'm in.
What?
You're not gonna have any nonsense made-up food?
No.

You know what?
So am I.
I probably shouldn't eat, either.
Damn.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?

Oh, no one.

All right.
I'll watch with you.
Oh, no.
Thanks, but I'm good.
Seriously?
You'd rather watch by yourself than watch with me?
Yeah.
It's my thing.
I have a little ritual.
You know?
It's my thing.
Well, your thing...
Is sad.
Not to me.
Okay.
Okay.
How about this?
You can watch football...
All by yourself, which is totally normal, but with me.
Toby.
Hmm?
This is something that I do alone.
Okay?
Sure.
Great.
Thank you for being so sweet.
Yeah.
Can you bring, like, a bowl of sugar for this?
Thank you.
Go, steelers!
Whoo!
Thank, God.
Can we please watch the game now?
The rose bowl is back.
Not an empty seat anywhere.
Hey.
Excuse me.
That was amazing.
Ah, yeah?
Really?
Yeah.
Oh!

There they are.
Hey!
- Yeah.
So sorry we're late.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were just about to head out the door, and the baby decides to projective vomit all over little Andy.
Yeah.
Almost got me, too.
So, what does Andy do?
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.
He slaps the baby.
Right across the face.
Pow!
No!
Is she okay?
Oh, she's fine.
Yeah.
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder, I'm screaming at Andy, and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,
Andy, she is a baby.
Like, you literally slapped a baby.
Which really helped, as you can imagine.
Of course, then Andy starts crying, baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
- We need drinks!
Weneeddrinks.
We'll be right back.
Okay.
Wow.
Promise me we are never having kids.
I think it's time for shots.

Oh, and bradshaw sucks!
Oh, no, bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.
Right, babe?
Yeah.
Big...
Big second half.
Are you okay?
Mm.
Fine.
Okay.
Actually, no.
Um, what did you mean before when, uh...
When you said...
"Promise me we'll never have kids"?
Oh.
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah, but... you did.
Kind of said it twice today.
And I shouldn't have.
Okay?
Sorry.
You know what we need to be doing?
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?
That's...
'Cause we-we never really talk about it.
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future, but it's the future now, bec, and I want kids.
You know what, we're gonna go grab another drink at the bar.
Okay.
...And see how the fans...
Let's go to the ginger man and Paul hornung.
L.A. fans have to be happy, Paul.
Bedtimesareat 8: 00 and 9:00-- that's teeth brushed, in the bed.
8:00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien, and then lights out, right?
That's too far.
Okay, listen, relax.
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home.
Okay?
The girls are gonna play.
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.
Oh, my God, please, take care of my babies.
And, please, don't call us.
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.
Oh, one more thing, though, before you go.
So, Tess was the, uh, the white wine drinker, right?
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.
Piss them off.
- Thanks.
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...
Yes.
It's a little too far.
He plays too much.
It's okay.
It's okay.
He plays too much.
Hey, call us if you need anything.
Don't call us.
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control, so what I've been finding to be really helpful
Is if I...
Take the portion out of the box and then I put the portion onto the plate and then I put the box
- Just pass it.
Away... and then I know...
How... how many crackers
I'm allowed to-to have.
Just pass it.
To h... to have, so then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers, then I have the ten crackers on my plate, which is fine, but at the same time,
there are other crackers that I like than-than other crackers.
So, I might not like saltine crackers as much as I like a cheez-it type cracker, but so, what I'll do with the cheez-it type cracker is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,
but I'm still rationing, so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate, but there might be 20 if it's a cheez-it.
But I still put the box away.
So, i-i mean i-i think that's...
That's a win.
Yeah.
She was always away on business.
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this...
But this was a different kind of alone.
She was always away on business, so i was used to being...
But...
So, I was...
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone, but this was a different kind of alone.
You know?

We want to have a Barbie fashion show.
Oh, cool.
That sounds fun.
So, go play Barbie fashion show.
We need you to be the celebrity judge.
Right.
Uh, the thing is I can't because I got this rehearsal tomorrow and I really want to be off book, so...
What does "off book" mean?
Off book.
Off book means, uh, means that I know my lines.
So, uh, you, uh...
Have grandpa be the judge.
Grandpa's not a celebrity.
Yeah.
Their logic seems sound.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um... tell you what?
You want to, you want to help me?
You want to, you want to read the play with me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
Come on, over here.
William, let's do it.
I'm not much of an actor.
Oh, doesn't matter.
I just need to get the lines down, so...
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.
Why does she get to be Jessica?
Well, um, be...
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.
It means you get to boss your sister around.
How's that sound?
So.
William, multiple questions.
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's a little delicate.
Go ahead.
Do you know how to read?
Yes, I can read.
I knew it.
I was joking.
Of course you know how to read.
Trying to be funny.
Okay.
So if you could please read the role of Brad.
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?
I have to pee.
Oh, I kind of do, too.
What are you... oh, good God.
Mm.
Now, this is what
I'm talking about.
Okay, babe, here's the plan.
Sex first.
Right away.
Loud, adult, no kids in the next room sex.
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.
We just need to get the job done.
And under no circumstances are we allowed to fall asleep afterwards watching house hunters.
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping.
Right?
Ooh.
We'll do it in the shower.
That's good.
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.
And we'll order room service before.
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes and eat burgers...
No, wait-- spaghetti.
No, I like burgers better.
We will eat burgers in bed.
Ooh.
Oh.
Now, the big question is...
What to order on pay-per-view.
Oh, I already hope they, uh, I hope they have that huge grant-meryl streep movie that sounds like a black lady.
Come on.
FlorencefosterJenkins.
Baby, they already got FlorencefosterJenkins.
I'm late.
I'm a week and a half late, Randall, and I feel like crap.
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore and get a pregnancy test.
I'm bugging out, baby.
I need you to talk me down.
Oh.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, good.
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery, broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.
Thank you, that's so nice.

So, what do you think, Jack?
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.
You want to do this now?
Okay.
Let's do it.
So...
I am not enough for you.
Am I not enough for you, Jack?
Okay, back to the bar?
Yup.
I never said that.
I just meant we need to have this conversation at some point.
Okay.
And you want to do that right now, at froggy's during the super bowl?
Yes, please don't make us miss a second of your drama.
Could you butt out?
Hey...

Wejokeabout it.

Did I not get the joke?
I'm not...
Babe, you're right.
You are right.
And coming from the family that-that I did,
I definitely never saw myself having kids.
Okay.
But then I met you.
And, you know, we're j... we're great together and I love our life.
But the older we get, the more I think that...
The more I think there's got to be something bigger than just me and you.
Well, thank you very much for involving me in this huge invisible change of yours.
Huge.
Because you knew when you met me and married me that I did not want to be one of those women whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.
I was thinking more your sister.
Oh.
You probably were.
I'm... it's a bad joke.
I'm not there yet, Jack.
I'm not there yet.
I am only 29.
Almost 30.
I know how old I am!
Hey, sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?
Could you just shut up for a second?
Mind your business.
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.
Wow.
You got to learn some manners, pal.
You need to control your woman.
You need to watch your mouth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jack, sit down.
Come here.
It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.
Jack.
God, Jack.
Jack!
Jack.
No!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, we should really be having kids.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Uh, yeah.
Like, how?
You take the pill every day like clockwork, right?
Yeah.
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?
No.
I...
I mean, I changed medications last month and there might have been, like, a brief window.
A brief window?
Sorry.
A brief window, Beth?
Did it not occur to you that that might be something you want to run by your husband?
Well,
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.
Well, there goes Charleston.
Okay, I'm sorry, what?
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.
Oh, forgive me, Randall, but what in the holy hell are you talking about?
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?
I saw something about it on CNN.
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.
Sometimes at work, i look up places on zillow.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here's a riddle-- who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time and maybe, maybe...
Start to remember who she was?
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
But now will have to split her time between a diaper station and a home office?
This girl, right here.
It's two thumbs.
What?
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say
"what has two thumbs and is mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Gonna be splitting time betw..." Shut up.
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.
Hey.
Also, some altoids.
Please.
Look at that picture.
That is a vivid picture.
I feel like I'm at the game.
Over across the field, here.
Yeah.
It's a really nice TV...
What is this?
Plasma?
Led?
You know, I'm really not sure, but...
Hey, Toby!
Yeah?
Uh, do you guys like jicama?
Plasma or led?
I...
Have no idea.
Kate?
Jicama?
What?
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?
Can... can you actually just move, tob?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep.
The receiver's all set.
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle, and going for the end zone!
Hey.
Shooter, uh, tell Kate about that time we accidentally went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.
Oh...
Uh, you got to hear this.
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.
Toby, you paused the TV.
It's like, paused.
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.
No, this is a great story.
No.
O-okay,
I know it's not a big deal, really, but I kind of like to watch sports as they happen live.
Probably just me, right?
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
I don't know.
...Tends to wait...
- Now we're behind the game!
Fast forward it!
Touch down!
And heyward made it all alone down the left side...
That's great.
That's your team, right?
That's my fantasy team.
What's that?
You know what,
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
I'm actually not feeling good.
I'm gonna go ahead and go.
Oh, no!
Yeah...
Are you sure?
Yeah.
No, Kate, stay.
Shooter...
It was really nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What... wait, wait, wait.
Seriously, thank you for the jicama.
What...
I'll talk to you later.
What is happening?
You have to let her go, David.
This is crazy, man.
She's gone and she's never coming back.
Whew.
You really never acted before?
Nope.
Voice like silk.
Yeah.
How am I supposed to move on, David?
No.
I'm David.
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?
And who made you the expert of moving on?
Or the expert of anything for that matter?
Is that how you're gonna do it?
No.
Good.
It's your line.
Uh,
Tess, honey, you have the next line, uh...
Pay attention.
I-I'd rather you not move on.
I'm--
I'm obv-
- I'm obviously not planning to.
It's not good.
Not as easy as it looks, is it?
No.
No.
Okay.
There she is!
Do you see her?
Who, David?
Did I see who?
Her!
She's right there.
And ever since she died, her ghost has been haunting me.
Hold up.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What's happening in this story?
You're not following the story?
Do you follow it?
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.
Um...
Mm-hmm.
She died, right?
She's dead.
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.
So when you die you become a ghost?
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.
So what happens when you die?
What happens when you die?
Uh, is... you die.
Forever?
Sure... or not.
I don't know.
Honey, here's the thing, you know, do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts?
Because I can...
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick, is grandpa gonna die?
Why are you asking me this?
Yes?
Yes.
Soon?
Well, you know, I mean,
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...
No!
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
Look, i-i mean, I meant it, but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?
You two?
You're gonna die.
Mommy and daddy are gonna die.
Mommy and daddy are gonna die?
- No.
Uh...
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, wil...
It is getting late.
It's bedtime, girls.
- Come on, girls.
- Yep.
Time to go to bed.
Uh, sleep tight.
Thanks for all the help.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?
Uh, about, uh, four months into her first pregnancy.
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.
She's right, pal.
Yeah.
She's totally right.
You can kiss this life good-bye.
Third and eight for Pittsburgh and bradshaw.
What if she doesn't want kids?
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?
Yeah!
I got to go find Shelly.
That over the wrong shoulder.
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.
73 yards.
And the terrible towels will come out throughout the rose bowl.
Not much doubt about the best team.
Justbeeninformed that the mvp for this contest as picked by sport magazine and their panel of voters is Terry bradshaw.
This isn't the night i had planned.
I know.
Shall we look?
Wait.
Just, um, let's...
let's...
Let's give it like, 30 more seconds.
Okay.
You'll still be able to work more.
I can work less.
We'll get a nanny.
Or a Manny.
God, no.
You know, if you still want that vacation house you can...
I don't.
It's too much trouble.
Worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids using it for their who knows what?
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.
We do make good kids.
That we do, that we do.
The girls will love it.
Oh, they'll go nuts.
Hey.
Hmm?
What has two thumbs and loves his wife so much it hurts?
Oh, it does work better with two thumbs.
Nah.
I like the way you do it.
Mm.
Well...
I like your face.
Shall we do this?
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.
I got to go talk to the girls.
Go talk to the girls-- what am I gonna say?
You know, I am clearly not the man that needs to be talking to them about the intricacies of life and death.
It's...
Ah.
You do that a lot.
I do what a lot?
Doubt yourself.
You were very good, Kevin.
On that show.
You watched the Manny?
Before I came here, i had one old television, got three channels.
I really liked that program.
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.
I liked the one where you lose the baby.
Oh, geez.
"Manny on fire." Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no.
That was a...
That was a strong episode.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I never should have left that show.
I've...
I never should have come here, that's for sure.
Being an Uncle, right, doing theater...
I...
I...
I'm not cut out for theater.
And there you go again.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?
You're the wise owl in a pixar film.
I'm the dopey labrador.
I'm a dying recovering addict.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, well, people love labradors.
Said the wise owl.
You want to know what it is?
It's this play, right?
I mean, these people that I'm working with, wow, they're like next level smart.
I mean, uh, they're brilliant.
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
You know, it doesn't ma-- it doesn't matter, it's...
You're just gonna think it's stupid.
Said the dopey labrador.
We did it!
If it's between you and having kids, you win.
Every time.
No question.
My father, he loved football more than anything.
Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.
But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.
As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.
I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.
Except i-I'd let them talk...
As loud as they wanted.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
God, there's nothing wrong with you, bec.
All of my friends my age have kids.
Every single one of them.
And...
Maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at froggy's and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.
I don't know.
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
I see us with kids, Jack.
Yeah.
I just...
I love our life.
I love it right now.
And I'm so scared of changing it.
I don't want to change it.
Okay?
I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.
Okay?
What we have together, you and me.
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.
I just...
I just want you.
The steelers won the super bowl.
Steelers won the super bowl.
Bradshaw won mvp.
My man.
Yes.
I am.
You are.
hey.
Hey.
Okay.
So, uh...
What was all that about today?
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.
Then why did you agree to come over?
I don't know.
'Cause I didn't want to...
Seem like a weirdo.
Okay.
So, now I know.
No hanging out on Sundays during football season.
I got it.
But it's not just about football.
Okay.
What's it about then?
Okay.
So, growing up,
I used to watch the steelers with my dad.
Right?
Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.
It wasn't until the 2006 afc championship when they played the broncos.
Do you remember?
No.
Okay.
Anyway,
I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.
And I did.
And they won.
And then they won the super bowl.
And I just...
It's just-just what I do now.
I watch the steelers, and...
I watch 'em with my dad.
He sounds like a cool guy.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um...
All right.
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.
Uh...
This is your dad?
Jack.
Wow.
I know it sounds crazy and lame, but football is a really big part of my family.
Like,reallybig.
Like,I wouldn'tevenbehere ifitwasn'tfor football.
Iwasconceived ina bathroom duringthesuperbowl.
Hi.
Sorry if I was a jerk before.
You're really not gonna forgive me?
Okay.
Um...
What if I told you a-a secret that I've never shared with anyone before?
Hmm?
We're listening.
Okay.
All right.
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.
Is this about you dating demi lovato?
Because everyone knows.
No.
You know what, it's not about demi lovato, and we were just friends.
I just...
Sometimes I... paint.
Now, no one knows this, not even your aunt Kate, but... when I get a script, the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.
Um...
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.
So...
I think I scared you before.
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.
All that adult stuff we were reading about.
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.
So, uh, you know,
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting, tell you what I think my play is about.
Because I was thinking, um, that it might make us all feel a little bit better.
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?
So, um...
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?
And life is full of color.
And we each get to come along and we add our own color to the painting.
You know?
And even though it's not very big, the painting, you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction.
So, like, to infinity, you know?
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?
Andit'sreallycrazy,if youthinkaboutit, isn 'tit, that,a hundredyearsago , someguy thatI nevermetcameto thiscountrywithasuitcase.
hehasason , whohasason , whohasme .
So, at first, when I was painting, I was thinking, you know, maybe up here, that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know, down here, that's my part of the painting.
And then I started to think, well, what if...
We're all in the painting, everywhere?
And-andwhatif we 'rein the painting before we're born?
Whatifwe 'rein it afterwedie?
Andthesecolors thatwekeepadding, whatiftheyjustkeep getting addedontopofoneanother, untileventuallywe 'renot evendifferentcolorsanymore?

The towel?
It's absolutely terrible.
He said you just go up and over and burrito him.
They'll be in college soon.
Your Highness.
Need to find you a crown.
We're pretty good together.
These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?
They do their little stint in theater just to feel better about themselves.
- I'm here for the right reasons.
- Let's get this over with, shall we?
- You got the part.
- Wait, I'm sorry.
What?
They think the nanny will sell tickets.
I did everything wrong by you, and you've done everything right.
Look.
It's Kevin.
Yo.
This is my biological father.
Wow.
Well, that probably is gonna be a longer conversation, but it's good to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Long signal pass.
Baltimore hopping out of an eight man front.
Namath throwing deep.
Sauer, gets wide, get it, he was there.
He had an inside step on Lenny Miles...
Beer.
Mommy.
Rebecca, you and your sister need to play somewhere else.
Your father's trying to watch the game.
Rick Volk, number 21, uh, coming with a fake safety blitz and he goes up top.
So that, um, is in pretty good...
He doesn't get all the glory of Rocky Bleier or Franco Harris, but he's been a great...
Jack.
Jack.
Jack!
Yeah.
Sorry.
No.
I refuse to be my mother staring at my father as he stares at the television.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
I think Cincinnati's looked a little tired...
So teach me.
Teach me football.
We got an offensive line...
- Mm-hmm.
- defensive line.
Quart...
- End zone, end zone.
- End zone, quarterback...
There's Bradshaw straight back...
You suck, Bradshaw!
- Come on, man.
- Babe...
The man has three Super Bowl rings.
- Give him a break.
- Yeah, he also had Franco wide open in the flat.
You're a freakin' bum, Bradshaw.
You're a freakin' bum.
Typical Bradshaw.
Super Bowl!
Mm!
Mwah!
Oh.
- Time to tailgate!
- Oh, already?
Yeah, babe.
I got to move.
Froggy's wants me to sing at their pre-game party.
- Super Bowl Sunday?
- Yeah.
Biggest crowd of the whole year.
- And we get to drink for free.
- Oh, yeah.
So be there early, okay?
I'll be there before Bradshaw even begins warming up his old noodle arm.
Whoa.
Easy on Bradshaw, babe.
Uh-huh.
Not in this house.
- That's my girl.
- Hmm.
Are Miguel and Shelly gonna make it?
Yeah.
They're gonna meet us there, you know, depending on if they can get a babysitter, and one that doesn't show up completely stoned out of her gourd this time.
Why do people have kids?
No idea.
All right.
You okay?
Stop.
Randall, wake the hell up.
You almost put a chemo pill in your shake.
Oh.
Uncle Kevin, why are you writing in your book?
Play, sweetheart.
It's a play, and the director wants me doing scene work.
You seem to be doing a lot of writing.
Well, I seem to be getting a lot of direction, William.
Tell you what.
You got a great voice.
You ever do any voice-over work?
Well, you should.
Really.
I mean, you could be a... like a...
like a...
like an owl in a Pixar movie,
- right?
- Yeah.
No offense.
Not sure why I would take offense to that.
Oh, I don't do blueberries.
- Me neither.
- Since when?
- Since now.
- Yeah.
It's not the taste, right?
It's the texture of the skin, it's gross.
Yeah.
I don't want blueberries either.
Yeah.
Understood.
Uh, any other dietary restrictions
I should let the staff know about?
No, man.
You're busy.
I'll just, you know,
I'll make a list for you later when I get some time.
Thanks, buddy.
You need to put something in your stomach, William.
Toast, pills, juice.
That's the order.
Okay?
Is that medicine?
Do you have a cold, Grandpa?
- Grandpa's fine.
- No.
They're just vitamins.
So.
You, uh, told the girls that he's Grandpa, but not that he's sick.
Right?
That's ballsy.
Hey, so, Kevin, uh, it's been a few days now, you know, since you showed up.
Without calling.
Right.
And... and it's great to see you.
I was just sort of wondering...
How do I say this politely?
When are you leaving?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Oh.
Yeah.
No, I mean, come on.
I can, I...
I can, um...
I can get out of here whenever.
I just...
I...
I saw this as an opportunity to hang with you two, you know, and the girls, but, uh...
Plus I... honestly, this play, guys,
- it's kicking my ass a little, You know?
- Mm.
And it's so lonely at that hotel.
I mean, I got this big suite all to myself but I guess the bigger the hotel room, the emptier it can feel.
You know?
I'm sitting there.
I got that 800 thread count sheets.
I got the endless minibar snacks.
You got the fancy oatmeal soaps, plush robes and all I can do is sit there and think about how... quiet it is.
- We'll take it.
- What's that?
Uh, the hotel.
Beth and I, we'll take it, tonight.
- No, Randall.
- Where are we gonna
- get a sitter?
- No, We got two family members
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- living in our house for free.
One of them played a nanny on TV.
- No.
- No, actually, an au pair.
Technically, I played an au pair on TV.
There's a difference.
A lot of people don't know that.
I was... an au pair.
They were gonna call the show,
What Au Pair, but The...
Manny tested better.
I-I can watch the girls.
- I'm-a go pack.
- Okay.
- I'm-a go pack right now.
- Wait.
Good morning.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Breakfast in bed?
Yeah.
What did I do to deserve this?
I don't know.
You've done a lot of really nice things for me, so I wanted to return the favor.
Oh.
By cutting up cardboard into little squares and putting it in a bowl?
Those are cheese squares.
- Oh, yum.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
What's on top?
Oh, hemp seed.
Hemp seeds on top?
Mm-hmm.
Boy, you really buried the lede.
Now I'm in.
What?
You're not gonna have any nonsense made-up food?
No.
Getting weighed at our meeting this afternoon.
You know what?
So am I.
I probably shouldn't eat, either.
Damn.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?
I was thinking miniature golf.
Last time,
I was like, 20 under going into the 18th, but that little windmill owns my ass.
I can't.
Steelers.
- Sunday Night Football.
- Hmm.
Saturday Night Football.
With who?
Oh, no one.
Just me.
- All right.
I'll watch with you.
- Oh, no.
Thanks, but I'm good.
Seriously?
You'd rather watch by yourself than watch with me?
Yeah.
It's my thing.
I have a little ritual.
You know?
It's my thing.
Well, your thing... is sad.
Not to me.
Okay.
Okay.
How about this?
You can watch football... all by yourself, which is totally normal, but with me.
- Toby.
- Hmm?
This is something that I do alone.
Okay?
Sure.
- Great.
Thank you for being so sweet.
- Yeah.
Can you bring, like, a bowl of sugar for this?
♪ And if you give me ♪
♪ Weed ♪
♪ Whites ♪
♪ And wine ♪
♪ And you show me a sign ♪
♪ I'll be ♪
♪ Willin' to be ♪
♪ Movin'. ♪
Thank you.
Go, Steelers!
Whoo!
Thank, God.
Can we please watch the game now?
The Rose Bowl is back.
Not an empty seat anywhere.
Hey.
- Excuse me.
- That was amazing.
- Ah, yeah?
Really?
- Yeah.
Oh!
Shelly, Miguel.
- There they are.
Hey!
- Yeah.
- So sorry we're late.
- It's okay.
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were just about to head out the door, and the baby decides to projective vomit
- all over little Andy.
- Yeah.
- Almost got me, too.
- So, what does Andy do?
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.
He slaps the baby.
Right across the face.
Pow!
- No!
Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.
Yeah.
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder, I'm screaming at Andy, and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,
Andy, she is a baby.
Like, you literally slapped a baby.
Which really helped, as you can imagine.
Of course, then Andy starts crying,
- baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
- We need drinks!
We need drinks.
We'll be right back.
Okay.
Wow.
Promise me we are never having kids.
I think it's time for shots.
26 is having a tough day.
The first half, the Rams, surprisingly,
- lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
- Pathetic.
Can't stop the run.
Oh, and Bradshaw sucks!
Oh, no, Bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.
Right, babe?
Yeah.
Big... big second half.
Are you okay?
Mm.
Fine.
Okay.
Actually, no.
Um, what did you mean before when, uh... when you said...
"Promise me we'll never have kids"?
Oh.
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah, but... you did.
Kind of said it twice today.
And I shouldn't have.
Okay?
Sorry.
You know what we need to be doing?
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?
That's...
'Cause we-we never really talk about it.
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future, but it's the future now, Bec, and I want kids.
You know what, we're gonna
- go grab another drink at the bar.
- Okay.
and see how the fans...
Let's go to the Ginger Man and Paul Hornung.
L.A. fans have to be happy, Paul.
Bedtimes are at 8:00
- and 9:00... that's teeth brushed, in the bed. -00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien, and then lights out, right?
That's too far.
Okay, listen, relax.
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home.
Okay?
The girls are gonna play.
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.
Oh, my God, please, take care of my babies.
And, please, don't call us.
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.
Oh, one more thing, though, before you go.
So, Tess was the, uh, the white wine drinker, right?
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.
- Piss them off.
- Thanks.
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...
- Yes.
- It's a little too far.
- He plays too much.
- It's okay.
- It's okay.
- He plays too much.
Hey, call us if you need anything.
Don't call us.
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control, so what I've been finding to be really helpful is if I... take the portion out of the box and then I put the portion onto the plate
- and then I put the box
- Just pass it.
Away... and then I know... how... how many crackers
I'm allowed to-to have.
Just pass it.
To h... to have, so then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers, then I have the ten crackers on my plate, which is fine, but at the same time,
there are other crackers that I like than-than other crackers.
So, I might not like saltine crackers as much as I like a Cheez-It type cracker, but so, what I'll do with the Cheez-It type cracker is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,
but I'm still rationing, so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate, but there might be 20 if it's a Cheez-It.
But I still put the box away.
So, I-I mean
I-I think that's... that's a win.
Yeah.
She was always away on business.
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this... but this was a different kind of alone.
She was always away on business, so I was used to being... but... so, I was...
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone, but this was a different kind of alone.
You know?
This-this... is a different kind of...
I thought you two were watching a movie.
We want to have a Barbie fashion show.
Oh, cool.
That sounds fun.
So, go play Barbie fashion show.
We need you to be the celebrity judge.
Right.
Uh, the thing is I can't because I got this rehearsal tomorrow and I really want to be off book, so...
What does "off book" mean?
Off book.
Off book means, uh, means that I know my lines.
So, uh, you, uh... have Grandpa be the judge.
Grandpa's not a celebrity.
Yeah.
Their logic seems sound.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um... tell you what?
You want to, you want to help me?
You want to, you want to read the play with me?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Oh, come on.
- Okay.
- Yeah, let's do that.
Come on, over here.
William,
- let's do it.
- I'm not much of an actor.
Oh, doesn't matter.
I just need to get the lines down, so...
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.
Why does she get to be Jessica?
Well, um, be...
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.
It means you get to boss your sister around.
How's that sound?
So.
William, multiple questions.
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you,
- it's a little delicate.
- Go ahead.
Do you know how to read?
Yes, I can read.
I knew it.
I was joking.
Of course you know how to read.
Trying to be funny.
Okay.
So if you could please read the role of Brad.
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?
I have to pee.
Oh, I kind of do, too.
What are you...
Oh, good God.
Mm.
Now, this is what
I'm talking about.
Okay, babe, here's the plan.
Sex first.
Right away.
Loud, adult, no kids in the next room sex.
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.
We just need to get the job done.
And under no circumstances are we allowed to fall asleep afterwards watching House Hunters.
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping.
Right?
Ooh.
We'll do it in the shower.
That's good.
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.
And we'll order room service before.
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes and eat burgers...
No, wait...
spaghetti.
No, I like burgers better.
We will eat burgers in bed.
Ooh.
Oh.
Now, the big question is... what to order on pay-per-view.
Oh, I already hope they, uh, I hope they have that
Huge Grant-Meryl Streep movie that sounds like a black lady.
Come on.
Florence Foster Jenkins.
Baby, they already got Florence Foster Jenkins.
I'm late.
I'm a week and a half late, Randall, and I feel like crap.
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore and get a pregnancy test.
I'm bugging out, baby.
I need you to talk me down.
Oh.
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, good.
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery, broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.
Thank you, that's so nice.
Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is my good friend, Shooter.
- Shooter, Kate.
- Hey.
- Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you, too.
Great news.
You both love sports, so... sports party.
and the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday Night Football.
Bradshaw drops back.
Bradshaw's got time...
So, what do you think, Jack?
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.
You want to do this now?
Okay.
Let's do it.
So...
I am not enough for you.
Am I not enough for you, Jack?
- Okay, back to the bar?
- Yup.
I never said that.
I just meant we need to have this conversation at some point.
Okay.
And you want to do that right now, at Froggy's
- during the Super Bowl?
- Yes, please don't make us
- miss a second of your drama.
- Could you butt out?
Hey... babe, we joke about it.
We see people with kids and go,
"Oh, thank God that's not us."
We joke about it.
Right?
Did I not get the joke?
I'm not...
Babe, you're right.
You are right.
And coming from the family that-that I did,
I definitely never saw myself having kids.
- Okay.
- But then I met you.
And, you know, we're j...
we're great together and I love our life.
But the older we get, the more I think that... the more I think there's got to be something bigger than just me and you.
Well, thank you very much for involving me in this huge invisible change of yours.
Huge.
Because you knew when you met me and married me that I did not want to be one of those women whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.
I was thinking more your sister.
Oh.
You probably were.
- I'm... it's a bad joke.
- I'm not there yet, Jack.
I'm not there yet.
- I am only 29.
- Almost 30.
I know how old I am!
Hey, Sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?
- Could you just shut up for a second?
- Mind your business.
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.
- Wow.
- You got to learn some manners, pal.
You need to control your woman.
- You need to watch your mouth.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jack, sit down.
Come here.
It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.
Jack.
- God, Jack.
- Jack!
Jack.
No!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, we should really be having kids.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Uh, yeah.
Like, how?
You take the pill every day like clockwork, right?
Yeah.
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?
No.
I...
I mean, I changed medications last month and there might have been, like, a brief window.
A brief window?
Sorry.
A brief window, Beth?
Did it not occur to you that that might be something
- you want to run by your husband?
- Well,
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.
Well, there goes Charleston.
Okay, I'm sorry, what?
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.
Oh, forgive me, Randall, but what in the holy hell are you talking about?
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?
I saw something about it on CNN.
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.
Sometimes at work, I look up places on Zillow.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here's a riddle... who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time and maybe, maybe... start to remember who she was?
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
But now will have to split her time between a diaper station and a home office?
This girl, right here.
- It's two thumbs.
- What?
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say
- "what has two thumbs and is
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
- Gonna be splitting time betw..."
- Shut up.
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.
Hey.
- Also, some Altoids.
- Please.
Look at that picture.
That is a vivid picture.
I feel like I'm at the game.
Over across the field, here.
Yeah.
It's a really nice TV...
What is this?
Plasma?
You know, I'm really not sure, but...
Hey, Toby!
Yeah?
Uh, do you guys like
- jicama?
- Plasma or LED?
I... have no idea.
- Kate?
Jicama?
- What?
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?
Can... can you actually just move, Tob?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep.
The receiver's all set.
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle, and going for the end zone!
Hey.
Shooter, uh, tell Kate about that time we accidentally went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.
Oh...
Uh, you got to hear this.
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.
Toby, you paused the TV.
It's like, paused.
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.
No, this is a great story.
No.
O-Okay,
I know it's not a big deal, really, but I kind of like to watch sports as they happen live.
Probably just me, right?
- Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
- I don't know.
- tends to wait...
- Now we're behind the game!
Fast forward it!
Touch down!
And Heyward made it all alone down the left side...
That's great.
That's your team, right?
That's my fantasy team.
- What's that?
- You know what,
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
I'm actually not feeling good.
I'm gonna go ahead and go.
- Oh, no!
- Yeah...
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- No, Kate, stay.
Shooter...
- it was really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- What... wait, wait, wait.
- Seriously,
- thank you for the jicama.
- What...
I'll talk to you later.
What is happening?
You have to let her go, David.
This is crazy, man.
She's gone and she's never coming back.
Whew.
You really never acted before?
Nope.
Voice like silk.
Yeah.
How am I supposed to move on, David?
No.
I'm David.
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?
And who made you the expert of moving on?
Or the expert of anything for that matter?
Is that how you're gonna do it?
No.
Good.
It's your line.
Uh,
- Tess, honey, you have the next line,
- Uh...
- pay attention.
- I-I'd rather you not move on.
I'm...
I'm obv...
I'm obviously not planning to.
It's not good.
Not as easy as it looks, is it?
- No.
- No.
Okay.
There she is!
Do you see her?
Who, David?
Did I see who?
Her!
She's right there.
And ever since she died, her ghost has been haunting me.
Hold up.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What's happening in this story?
You're not following the story?
Do you follow it?
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.
Um...
- Mm-hmm.
- She died, right?
She's dead.
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.
So when you die you become a ghost?
No.
- No, no, no, no, no.
No.
- Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.
So what happens when you die?
What happens when you die?
Uh, is... you die.
Forever?
Sure... or not.
I don't know.
Honey, here's the thing, you know, do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts?
Because I can...
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick, is Grandpa gonna die?
Why are you asking me this?
Yes?
Yes.
Soon?
Well, you know, I mean,
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...
No!
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
Look, I-I mean, I meant it, but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?
You two?
You're gonna die.
Mommy and Daddy are gonna die.
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna die?
- No.
Uh...
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, Wil...
it is getting late.
It's bedtime, girls.
- Come on, girls.
- Yep.
Time to go to bed.
Uh, sleep tight.
Thanks for all the help.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?
Uh, about, uh, four months into her first pregnancy.
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.
She's right, pal.
Yeah.
She's totally right.
You can kiss this life good-bye.
Third and eight for Pittsburgh and Bradshaw.
What if she doesn't want kids?
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?
Yeah!
I got to go find Shelly.
That over the wrong shoulder.
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.
73 yards.
And the terrible towels will come out throughout the Rose Bowl.
Not much doubt about the best team.
Just been informed that the MVP for this contest as picked by Sport Magazine and their panel of voters is Terry Bradshaw.
This isn't the night I had planned.
I know.
Shall we look?
Wait.
Just, um, let's...
let's... let's give it like, 30 more seconds.
Okay.
You'll still be able to work more.
I can work less.
We'll get a nanny.
Or a manny.
God, no.
You know, if you still want
- that vacation house you can...
- I don't.
It's too much trouble.
Worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids using it for their who knows what?
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.
We do make good kids.
That we do, that we do.
The girls will love it.
Oh, they'll go nuts.
- Hey.
- Hmm?
What has two thumbs and loves his wife so much it hurts?
Oh, it does work better with two thumbs.
Nah.
I like the way you do it.
Mm.
Well...
I like your face.
Shall we do this?
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.
I got to go talk to the girls.
Go talk to the girls...
what am I gonna say?
You know, I am clearly not the man that needs to be talking to them about the intricacies of life and death.
It's...
Ah.
You do that a lot.
I do what a lot?
Doubt yourself.
You were very good, Kevin.
On that show.
You watched The Manny?
Before I came here, I had one old television, got three channels.
I really liked that program.
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.
I liked the one where you lose the baby.
Oh, geez.
- "Manny on Fire."
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no.
That was a...
That was a strong episode.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I never should have left that show.
I've...
I never should have come here, that's for sure.
Being an uncle, right, doing theater...
I'm not cut out for theater.
And there you go again.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?
You're the wise owl in a Pixar film.
I'm the dopey Labrador.
I'm a dying recovering addict.
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah, well, people love Labradors.
Said the wise owl.
You want to know what it is?
It's this play, right?
I mean, these people that I'm working with, wow, they're like next level smart.
I mean, uh, they're brilliant.
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
You know, it doesn't ma...
it doesn't matter, it's...
You're just gonna think it's stupid.
Said the dopey Labrador.
We did it!
If it's between you and having kids, you win.
Every time.
No question.
My father, he loved football more than anything.
Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.
But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.
As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.
I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.
Except I-I'd let them talk... as loud as they wanted.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
God, there's nothing wrong with you, Bec.
All of my friends my age have kids.
Every single one of them.
And... maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at Froggy's and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.
I don't know.
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
I see us with kids, Jack.
Yeah.
I just...
I love our life.
I love it right now.
And I'm so scared of changing it.
I don't want to change it.
Okay?
I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.
Okay?
What we have together, you and me.
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.
I just...
I just want you.
The Steelers won the Super Bowl.
Steelers won the Super Bowl.
Bradshaw won MVP.
My man.
Yes.
I am.
You are.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Okay.
So, uh... what was all that about today?
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.
Then why did you agree to come over?
I don't know.
'Cause I didn't want to... seem like a weirdo.
Okay.
So, now I know.
No hanging out on Sundays during football season.
- I got it.
- But it's not just about football.
Okay.
What's it about then?
Okay.
So, growing up,
I used to watch the Steelers with my dad.
Right?
Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.
It wasn't until the 2006 AFC Championship when they played the Broncos.
Do you remember?
No.
Okay.
Anyway,
I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.
And I did.
And they won.
And then they won the Super Bowl.
And I just...
It's just-just what I do now.
I watch the Steelers, and...
I watch 'em with my dad.
He sounds like a cool guy.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Um...
- All right.
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.
Uh...
This is your dad?
Jack.
Wow.
I know it sounds crazy and lame, but football is a really big part of my family.
Like, really big.
Like, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for football.
I was conceived in a bathroom during the Super Bowl.
Hi.
Sorry if I was a jerk before.
You're really not gonna forgive me?
Okay.
Um... what if I told you a-a secret that I've never shared with anyone before?
- Hmm?
- We're listening.
Okay.
All right.
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.
Is this about you dating Demi Lovato?
Because everyone knows.
No.
You know what, it's not about Demi Lovato, and we were just friends.
I just...
Sometimes I... paint.
Now, no one knows this, not even your Aunt Kate, but... when I get a script, the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.
Um...
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.
So...
I think I scared you before.
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.
All that adult stuff we were reading about.
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.
So, uh, you know,
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting, tell you what I think my play is about.
Because I was thinking, um, that it might make us all feel a little bit better.
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?
So, um...
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?
And life is full of color.
And we each get to come along and we add our own color to the painting.
You know?
And even though it's not very big, the painting, you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction.
So, like, to infinity, you know?
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?
And it's really crazy, if you think about it, isn't it, that, a hundred years ago, some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase.
He has a son, who has a son, who has me.
So, at first, when I was painting, I was thinking, you know, maybe up here, that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know, down here, that's my part of the painting.
And then I started to think, well, what if... we're all in the painting, everywhere?
And-and what if we're in the painting before we're born?
What if we're in it after we die?
And these colors that we keep adding, what if they just keep getting added on top of one another, until eventually we're not even different colors anymore?
We're just... one thing.
One painting.
- Lucky cap.
- Lucky cap.
I mean, my dad is not with us anymore.
He's not alive, but he's with us.
He's with me every day.
It all just sort of fits somehow.
And even if you don't understand how yet, people will die in our lives, people that we love.
In the future.
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe years from now.
I mean, it's kind of beautiful, right, if you think about it, the fact that just because someone dies, just because you can't see them or talk to them anymore, it doesn't mean they're not still in the painting.
I think maybe that's the point of the whole thing.
There's no dying.
There's no you or me or them.
It's just us.
And this... sloppy... wild, colorful, magical thing that has no beginning, it has no end... this right here...
I think it's us.
You promise you like your gift?
Previously,onthisisus...
The towel?
It's absolutely terrible.
He said you just go up and over and burrito him.
They'll be in college soon.
Your highness.
Need to find you a crown.
we're pretty good together.
TheseL.A.actors, they come out here, right?
They do their little stint in theater just to feel better about themselves.
I'm here for the right reasons.
Let's get this over with, shall we?
You got the part.
Wait, I'm sorry.
What?
They think the nanny will sell tickets.
I did everything wrong by you, and you've done everything right.
Look.
It's Kevin.
Yo.
This is my biological father.
Wow.
Well, that probably is gonna be a longer conversation, but it's good to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Long signal pass.
Baltimore hopping out of an eight man front.
Namath throwing deep.
Sauer, gets wide, get it, he was there.
He had an inside step on Lenny Miles...
Beer.
Mommy.
Rebecca, you and your sister need to play somewhere else.
Your father's trying to watch the game.
...rick volk, number 21, uh, coming with a fake safety blitz and he goes up top.
So that, um, is in pretty good...
He doesn't get all the glory of rocky bleier or Franco Harris, but he's been a great...
* You are my easy love *
Jack.
Jack.
Jack!
Yeah.
Sorry.
No.
I refuse to be my mother staring at my father as he stares at the television.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
I think Cincinnati's looked a little tired...
So teach me.
Teach me football.
Wegotan offensiveline...
Mm-hmm.
...Defensive line.
Quart...
End zone, end zone.
End zone, quarterback...
There's bradshaw straight back...
You suck, bradshaw!
Come on, man.
Babe...
The man has three super bowl rings.
Give him a break.
Yeah, he also had Franco wide open in the flat.
You're a freakin' bum, bradshaw.
You're a freakin' bum.
Typical bradshaw.
Super bowl!
Mm!
Mwah!
Oh.
Time to tailgate!
Oh, already?
Yeah, babe.
I got to move.
Froggy's wants me to sing at their pre-game party.
Super bowl Sunday?
Yeah.
Biggest crowd of the whole year.
And we get to drink for free.
Oh, yeah.
So be there early, okay?
I'll be there before bradshaw even begins warming up his old noodle arm.
Whoa.
Easy on bradshaw, babe.
Uh-huh.
Not in this house.
That's my girl.
Hmm.
Are Miguel and Shelly gonna make it?
Yeah.
They're gonna meet us there, you know, depending on if they can get a babysitter, and one that doesn't show up completely stoned out of her gourd this time.
Why do people have kids?
No idea.
All right.
You okay?
Stop.
Randall, wake the hell up.
You almost put a chemo pill in your shake.
Oh.
Uncle Kevin, why are you writing in your book?
Play, sweetheart.
It's a play, and the director wants me doing scene work.
You seem to be doing a lot of writing.
Well, I seem to be getting a lot of direction, William.
Tell you what.
You got a great voice.
You ever do any voice-over work?
Well, you should.
Really.
I mean, you could be a...
Like a...
like a...
Like an owl in a pixar movie, right?
- Yeah.
No offense.
Not sure why I would take offense to that.
Oh, I don't do blueberries.
Me neither.
Since when?
Since now.
- Yeah.
It's not the taste, right?
It's the texture of the skin, it's gross.
Yeah.
I don't want blueberries either.
Yeah.
Understood.
Uh, any other dietary restrictions
I should let the staff know about?
No, man.
You're busy.
I'll just, you know,
I'll make a list for you later when I get some time.
Thanks, buddy.
You need to put something in your stomach, William.
Toast, pills, juice.
That's the order.
Okay?
Is that medicine?
Do you have a cold, grandpa?
Grandpa's fine.
No.
They're just vitamins.
So.
You, uh, told the girls that he's grandpa, but not that he's sick.
Right?
That's ballsy.
Hey, so, Kevin, uh, it's been a few days now, you know, since you showed up.
Without calling.
Right.
And... and it's great to see you.
I was just sort of wondering...
How do I say this politely?
When are you leaving?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
No, I mean, come on.
I can, I...
I can, um...
I can get out of here whenever.
I just...
I...
I saw this as an opportunity to hang with you two, you know, and the girls, but, uh...
Plus I... honestly, this play, guys, it's kicking my ass a little, you know?
Mm.
And it's so lonely at that hotel.
I mean, I got this big suite all to myself but I guess the bigger the hotel room, the emptier it can feel.
You know?
I'm sitting there.
I got that 800 thread count sheets.
I got the endless minibar snacks.
You got the fancy oatmeal soaps, plush robes and all i can do is sit there and think about how...
Quiet it is.
We'll take it.
What's that?
Uh, the hotel.
Beth and I, we'll take it, tonight.
No, Randall.
Where are we gonna get a sitter?
No, we got two family members oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Living in our house for free.
One of them played a nanny on TV.
No.
No, actually, an au pair.
Technically, I played an au pair on TV.
There's a difference.
A lot of people don't know that.
I was... an au pair.
They were gonna call the show, whataupair,but the ...
Mannytestedbetter.
I-i can watch the girls.
I'm-a go pack.
Okay.
I'm-a go pack right now.
Wait.
Good morning.
Hey.
Hi.
Breakfast in bed?
Yeah.
What did I do to deserve this?
I don't know.
You've done a lot of really nice things for me, so I wanted to return the favor.
Oh.
By cutting up cardboard into little squares and putting it in a bowl?
Those are cheese squares.
Oh, yum.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What's on top?
Oh, hemp seed.
Hemp seeds on top?
Mm-hmm.
Boy, you really buried the lede.
Now I'm in.
What?
You're not gonna have any nonsense made-up food?
No.
Getting weighed at our meeting this afternoon.
You know what?
So am I.
I probably shouldn't eat, either.
Damn.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?
I was thinking miniature golf.
Last time,
I was like, 20 under going into the 18th, but that little windmill owns my ass.
I can't.
Steelers.
Sundaynightfootball.
Hmm.
Saturday night football.
With who?
Oh, no one.
Just me.
All right.
I'll watch with you.
Oh, no.
Thanks, but I'm good.
Seriously?
You'd rather watch by yourself than watch with me?
Yeah.
It's my thing.
I have a little ritual.
You know?
It's my thing.
Well, your thing...
Is sad.
Not to me.
Okay.
Okay.
How about this?
You can watch football...
All by yourself, which is totally normal, but with me.
Toby.
Hmm?
This is something that I do alone.
Okay?
Sure.
Great.
Thank you for being so sweet.
Yeah.
Can you bring, like, a bowl of sugar for this?
* and if you give me * * weed * * whites * * and wine * * and you show me a sign *
* I'll be * * willing' to be * * movin'. *
Thank you.
Go, steelers!
Whoo!
Thank, God.
Can we please watch the game now?
The rose bowl is back.
Not an empty seat anywhere.
Hey.
Excuse me.
That was amazing.
Ah, yeah?
Really?
Yeah.
Oh!
Shelly, Miguel.
There they are.
Hey!
- Yeah.
So sorry we're late.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were just about to head out the door, and the baby decides to projective vomit all over little Andy.
Yeah.
Almost got me, too.
So, what does Andy do?
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.
He slaps the baby.
Right across the face.
Pow!
No!
Is she okay?
Oh, she's fine.
Yeah.
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder, I'm screaming at Andy, and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,
Andy, she is a baby.
Like, you literally slapped a baby.
Which really helped, as you can imagine.
Of course, then Andy starts crying, baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
- We need drinks!
Weneeddrinks.
We'll be right back.
Okay.
Wow.
Promise me we are never having kids.
I think it's time for shots.
Somebody's down.
26 is having a tough day.
The first half, the rams, surprisingly, lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
- Pathetic.
Can't stop the run.
Oh, and bradshaw sucks!
Oh, no, bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.
Right, babe?
Yeah.
Big...
Big second half.
Are you okay?
Mm.
Fine.
Okay.
Actually, no.
Um, what did you mean before when, uh...
When you said...
"Promise me we'll never have kids"?
Oh.
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah, but... you did.
Kind of said it twice today.
And I shouldn't have.
Okay?
Sorry.
You know what we need to be doing?
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?
That's...
'Cause we-we never really talk about it.
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future, but it's the future now, bec, and I want kids.
You know what, we're gonna go grab another drink at the bar.
Okay.
...And see how the fans...
Let's go to the ginger man and Paul hornung.
L.A. fans have to be happy, Paul.
Bedtimesareat 8: 00 and 9:00-- that's teeth brushed, in the bed.
8:00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien, and then lights out, right?
That's too far.
Okay, listen, relax.
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home.
Okay?
The girls are gonna play.
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.
Oh, my God, please, take care of my babies.
And, please, don't call us.
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.
Oh, one more thing, though, before you go.
So, Tess was the, uh, the white wine drinker, right?
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.
Piss them off.
- Thanks.
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...
Yes.
It's a little too far.
He plays too much.
It's okay.
It's okay.
He plays too much.
Hey, call us if you need anything.
Don't call us.
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control, so what I've been finding to be really helpful
Is if I...
Take the portion out of the box and then I put the portion onto the plate and then I put the box
- Just pass it.
Away... and then I know...
How... how many crackers
I'm allowed to-to have.
Just pass it.
To h... to have, so then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers, then I have the ten crackers on my plate, which is fine, but at the same time,
there are other crackers that I like than-than other crackers.
So, I might not like saltine crackers as much as I like a cheez-it type cracker, but so, what I'll do with the cheez-it type cracker is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,
but I'm still rationing, so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate, but there might be 20 if it's a cheez-it.
But I still put the box away.
So, i-i mean i-i think that's...
That's a win.
Yeah.
She was always away on business.
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this...
But this was a different kind of alone.
She was always away on business, so i was used to being...
But...
So, I was...
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone, but this was a different kind of alone.
You know?
This-this...
Is a different kind of...
I thought you two were watching a movie.
We want to have a Barbie fashion show.
Oh, cool.
That sounds fun.
So, go play Barbie fashion show.
We need you to be the celebrity judge.
Right.
Uh, the thing is I can't because I got this rehearsal tomorrow and I really want to be off book, so...
What does "off book" mean?
Off book.
Off book means, uh, means that I know my lines.
So, uh, you, uh...
Have grandpa be the judge.
Grandpa's not a celebrity.
Yeah.
Their logic seems sound.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um... tell you what?
You want to, you want to help me?
You want to, you want to read the play with me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
Come on, over here.
William, let's do it.
I'm not much of an actor.
Oh, doesn't matter.
I just need to get the lines down, so...
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.
Why does she get to be Jessica?
Well, um, be...
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.
It means you get to boss your sister around.
How's that sound?
So.
William, multiple questions.
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's a little delicate.
Go ahead.
Do you know how to read?
Yes, I can read.
I knew it.
I was joking.
Of course you know how to read.
Trying to be funny.
Okay.
So if you could please read the role of Brad.
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?
I have to pee.
Oh, I kind of do, too.
What are you... oh, good God.
Mm.
Now, this is what
I'm talking about.
Okay, babe, here's the plan.
Sex first.
Right away.
Loud, adult, no kids in the next room sex.
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.
We just need to get the job done.
And under no circumstances are we allowed to fall asleep afterwards watching house hunters.
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping.
Right?
Ooh.
We'll do it in the shower.
That's good.
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.
And we'll order room service before.
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes and eat burgers...
No, wait-- spaghetti.
No, I like burgers better.
We will eat burgers in bed.
Ooh.
Oh.
Now, the big question is...
What to order on pay-per-view.
Oh, I already hope they, uh, I hope they have that huge grant-meryl streep movie that sounds like a black lady.
Come on.
FlorencefosterJenkins.
Baby, they already got FlorencefosterJenkins.
I'm late.
I'm a week and a half late, Randall, and I feel like crap.
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore and get a pregnancy test.
I'm bugging out, baby.
I need you to talk me down.
Oh.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, good.
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery, broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.
Thank you, that's so nice.
Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is my good friend, shooter.
Shooter, Kate.
Hey.
Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, too.
Great news.
You both love sports, so...
Sports party.
...And the Kansas City chiefs on Sunday night football.
Bradshaw drops back.
Bradshaw's got time...
So, what do you think, Jack?
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.
You want to do this now?
Okay.
Let's do it.
So...
I am not enough for you.
Am I not enough for you, Jack?
Okay, back to the bar?
Yup.
I never said that.
I just meant we need to have this conversation at some point.
Okay.
And you want to do that right now, at froggy's during the super bowl?
Yes, please don't make us miss a second of your drama.
Could you butt out?
Hey...
Babe, wejokeaboutit.
We see people with kids and go,
"oh, thank God that's not us."
Wejokeabout it.
Right?
Did I not get the joke?
I'm not...
Babe, you're right.
You are right.
And coming from the family that-that I did,
I definitely never saw myself having kids.
Okay.
But then I met you.
And, you know, we're j... we're great together and I love our life.
But the older we get, the more I think that...
The more I think there's got to be something bigger than just me and you.
Well, thank you very much for involving me in this huge invisible change of yours.
Huge.
Because you knew when you met me and married me that I did not want to be one of those women whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.
I was thinking more your sister.
Oh.
You probably were.
I'm... it's a bad joke.
I'm not there yet, Jack.
I'm not there yet.
I am only 29.
Almost 30.
I know how old I am!
Hey, sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?
Could you just shut up for a second?
Mind your business.
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.
Wow.
You got to learn some manners, pal.
You need to control your woman.
You need to watch your mouth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jack, sit down.
Come here.
It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.
Jack.
God, Jack.
Jack!
Jack.
No!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, we should really be having kids.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Uh, yeah.
Like, how?
You take the pill every day like clockwork, right?
Yeah.
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?
No.
I...
I mean, I changed medications last month and there might have been, like, a brief window.
A brief window?
Sorry.
A brief window, Beth?
Did it not occur to you that that might be something you want to run by your husband?
Well,
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.
Well, there goes Charleston.
Okay, I'm sorry, what?
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.
Oh, forgive me, Randall, but what in the holy hell are you talking about?
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?
I saw something about it on CNN.
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.
Sometimes at work, i look up places on zillow.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here's a riddle-- who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time and maybe, maybe...
Start to remember who she was?
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
But now will have to split her time between a diaper station and a home office?
This girl, right here.
It's two thumbs.
What?
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say
"what has two thumbs and is mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Gonna be splitting time betw..." Shut up.
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.
Hey.
Also, some altoids.
Please.
Look at that picture.
That is a vivid picture.
I feel like I'm at the game.
Over across the field, here.
Yeah.
It's a really nice TV...
What is this?
Plasma?
Led?
You know, I'm really not sure, but...
Hey, Toby!
Yeah?
Uh, do you guys like jicama?
Plasma or led?
I...
Have no idea.
Kate?
Jicama?
What?
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?
Can... can you actually just move, tob?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep.
The receiver's all set.
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle, and going for the end zone!
Hey.
Shooter, uh, tell Kate about that time we accidentally went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.
Oh...
Uh, you got to hear this.
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.
Toby, you paused the TV.
It's like, paused.
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.
No, this is a great story.
No.
O-okay,
I know it's not a big deal, really, but I kind of like to watch sports as they happen live.
Probably just me, right?
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
I don't know.
...Tends to wait...
- Now we're behind the game!
Fast forward it!
Touch down!
And heyward made it all alone down the left side...
That's great.
That's your team, right?
That's my fantasy team.
What's that?
You know what,
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
I'm actually not feeling good.
I'm gonna go ahead and go.
Oh, no!
Yeah...
Are you sure?
Yeah.
No, Kate, stay.
Shooter...
It was really nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What... wait, wait, wait.
Seriously, thank you for the jicama.
What...
I'll talk to you later.
What is happening?
You have to let her go, David.
This is crazy, man.
She's gone and she's never coming back.
Whew.
You really never acted before?
Nope.
Voice like silk.
Yeah.
How am I supposed to move on, David?
No.
I'm David.
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?
And who made you the expert of moving on?
Or the expert of anything for that matter?
Is that how you're gonna do it?
No.
Good.
It's your line.
Uh,
Tess, honey, you have the next line, uh...
Pay attention.
I-I'd rather you not move on.
I'm--
I'm obv-
- I'm obviously not planning to.
It's not good.
Not as easy as it looks, is it?
No.
No.
Okay.
There she is!
Do you see her?
Who, David?
Did I see who?
Her!
She's right there.
And ever since she died, her ghost has been haunting me.
Hold up.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What's happening in this story?
You're not following the story?
Do you follow it?
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.
Um...
Mm-hmm.
She died, right?
She's dead.
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.
So when you die you become a ghost?
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.
So what happens when you die?
What happens when you die?
Uh, is... you die.
Forever?
Sure... or not.
I don't know.
Honey, here's the thing, you know, do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts?
Because I can...
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick, is grandpa gonna die?
Why are you asking me this?
Yes?
Yes.
Soon?
Well, you know, I mean,
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...
No!
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
Look, i-i mean, I meant it, but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?
You two?
You're gonna die.
Mommy and daddy are gonna die.
Mommy and daddy are gonna die?
- No.
Uh...
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, wil...
It is getting late.
It's bedtime, girls.
- Come on, girls.
- Yep.
Time to go to bed.
Uh, sleep tight.
Thanks for all the help.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?
Uh, about, uh, four months into her first pregnancy.
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.
She's right, pal.
Yeah.
She's totally right.
You can kiss this life good-bye.
Third and eight for Pittsburgh and bradshaw.
What if she doesn't want kids?
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?
Yeah!
I got to go find Shelly.
That over the wrong shoulder.
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.
73 yards.
And the terrible towels will come out throughout the rose bowl.
Not much doubt about the best team.
Justbeeninformed that the mvp for this contest as picked by sport magazine and their panel of voters is Terry bradshaw.
This isn't the night i had planned.
I know.
Shall we look?
Wait.
Just, um, let's...
let's...
Let's give it like, 30 more seconds.
Okay.
You'll still be able to work more.
I can work less.
We'll get a nanny.
Or a Manny.
God, no.
You know, if you still want that vacation house you can...
I don't.
It's too much trouble.
Worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids using it for their who knows what?
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.
We do make good kids.
That we do, that we do.
The girls will love it.
Oh, they'll go nuts.
Hey.
Hmm?
What has two thumbs and loves his wife so much it hurts?
Oh, it does work better with two thumbs.
Nah.
I like the way you do it.
Mm.
Well...
I like your face.
Shall we do this?
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.
I got to go talk to the girls.
Go talk to the girls-- what am I gonna say?
You know, I am clearly not the man that needs to be talking to them about the intricacies of life and death.
It's...
Ah.
You do that a lot.
I do what a lot?
Doubt yourself.
You were very good, Kevin.
On that show.
You watched the Manny?
Before I came here, i had one old television, got three channels.
I really liked that program.
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.
I liked the one where you lose the baby.
Oh, geez.
"Manny on fire." Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no.
That was a...
That was a strong episode.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I never should have left that show.
I've...
I never should have come here, that's for sure.
Being an Uncle, right, doing theater...
I...
I...
I'm not cut out for theater.
And there you go again.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?
You're the wise owl in a pixar film.
I'm the dopey labrador.
I'm a dying recovering addict.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, well, people love labradors.
Said the wise owl.
You want to know what it is?
It's this play, right?
I mean, these people that I'm working with, wow, they're like next level smart.
I mean, uh, they're brilliant.
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
You know, it doesn't ma-- it doesn't matter, it's...
You're just gonna think it's stupid.
Said the dopey labrador.
We did it!
If it's between you and having kids, you win.
Every time.
No question.
My father, he loved football more than anything.
Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.
But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.
As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.
I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.
Except i-I'd let them talk...
As loud as they wanted.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
God, there's nothing wrong with you, bec.
All of my friends my age have kids.
Every single one of them.
And...
Maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at froggy's and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.
I don't know.
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
I see us with kids, Jack.
Yeah.
I just...
I love our life.
I love it right now.
And I'm so scared of changing it.
I don't want to change it.
Okay?
I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.
Okay?
What we have together, you and me.
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.
I just...
I just want you.
The steelers won the super bowl.
Steelers won the super bowl.
Bradshaw won mvp.
My man.
Yes.
I am.
You are.
hey.
Hey.
Okay.
So, uh...
What was all that about today?
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.
Then why did you agree to come over?
I don't know.
'Cause I didn't want to...
Seem like a weirdo.
Okay.
So, now I know.
No hanging out on Sundays during football season.
I got it.
But it's not just about football.
Okay.
What's it about then?
Okay.
So, growing up,
I used to watch the steelers with my dad.
Right?
Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.
It wasn't until the 2006 afc championship when they played the broncos.
Do you remember?
No.
Okay.
Anyway,
I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.
And I did.
And they won.
And then they won the super bowl.
And I just...
It's just-just what I do now.
I watch the steelers, and...
I watch 'em with my dad.
He sounds like a cool guy.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um...
All right.
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.
Uh...
This is your dad?
Jack.
Wow.
I know it sounds crazy and lame, but football is a really big part of my family.
Like,reallybig.
Like,I wouldn'tevenbehere ifitwasn'tfor football.
Iwasconceived ina bathroom duringthesuperbowl.
Hi.
Sorry if I was a jerk before.
You're really not gonna forgive me?
Okay.
Um...
What if I told you a-a secret that I've never shared with anyone before?
Hmm?
We're listening.
Okay.
All right.
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.
Is this about you dating demi lovato?
Because everyone knows.
No.
You know what, it's not about demi lovato, and we were just friends.
I just...
Sometimes I... paint.
Now, no one knows this, not even your aunt Kate, but... when I get a script, the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.
Um...
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.
So...
I think I scared you before.
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.
All that adult stuff we were reading about.
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.
So, uh, you know,
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting, tell you what I think my play is about.
Because I was thinking, um, that it might make us all feel a little bit better.
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?
So, um...
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?
And life is full of color.
And we each get to come along and we add our own color to the painting.
You know?
And even though it's not very big, the painting, you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction.
So, like, to infinity, you know?
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?
Andit'sreallycrazy,if youthinkaboutit, isn 'tit, that,a hundredyearsago , someguy thatI nevermetcameto thiscountrywithasuitcase.
hehasason , whohasason , whohasme .
So, at first, when I was painting, I was thinking, you know, maybe up here, that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know, down here, that's my part of the painting.
And then I started to think, well, what if...
We're all in the painting, everywhere?
And-andwhatif we 'rein the painting before we're born?
Whatifwe 'rein it afterwedie?
Andthesecolors thatwekeepadding, whatiftheyjustkeep getting addedontopofoneanother, untileventuallywe 'renot evendifferentcolorsanymore?

You promise you like your gift?
Previously, on This Is Us...
The towel?
It's absolutely terrible.
He said you just go up and over and burrito him.
They'll be in college soon.
Your Highness.
Need to find you a crown.
We're pretty good together.
These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?
They do their little stint in theater just to feel better about themselves.
- I'm here for the right reasons.
- Let's get this over with, shall we?
- You got the part.
- Wait, I'm sorry.
What?
They think the nanny will sell tickets.
I did everything wrong by you, and you've done everything right.
Look.
It's Kevin.
Yo.
This is my biological father.
Wow.
Well, that probably is gonna be a longer conversation, but it's good to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Long signal pass.
Baltimore hopping out of an eight man front.
Namath throwing deep.
Sauer, gets wide, get it, he was there.
He had an inside step on Lenny Miles...
Beer.
Mommy.
Rebecca, you and your sister need to play somewhere else.
Your father's trying to watch the game.
Rick Volk, number 21, coming with a fake safety blitz and he goes up top.
So that, um, is in pretty good...
He doesn't get all the glory of Rocky Bleier or Franco Harris, but he's been a great...
Jack.
Jack.
Jack!
Yeah.
Sorry.
No.
I refuse to be my mother staring at my father as he stares at the television.
Okay.
I think Cincinnati's looked a little tired...
So teach me.
Teach me football.
We got an offensive line... defensive line.
Quart...
- End zone, end zone.
- End zone, quarterback...
There's Bradshaw straight back...
You suck, Bradshaw!
- Come on, man.
- Babe...
The man has three Super Bowl rings.
- Give him a break.
- Yeah, he also had Franco wide open in the flat.
You're a freakin' bum, Bradshaw.
You're a freakin' bum.
Typical Bradshaw.
Super Bowl!
Mwah!
- Time to tailgate!
- Already?
Yeah, babe.
I got to move.
Froggy's wants me to sing at their pre-game party.
- Super Bowl Sunday?
- Yeah.
Biggest crowd of the whole year.
- And we get to drink for free.
- Yeah.
So be there early, okay?
I'll be there before Bradshaw even begins warming up his old noodle arm.
Whoa.
Easy on Bradshaw, babe.
Not in this house.
That's my girl.
Are Miguel and Shelly gonna make it?
Yeah.
They're gonna meet us there, you know, depending on if they can get a babysitter, and one that doesn't show up completely stoned out of her gourd this time.
Why do people have kids?
No idea.
All right.
You okay?
Stop.
Randall, wake the hell up.
You almost put a chemo pill in your shake.
Uncle Kevin, why are you writing in your book?
Play, sweetheart.
It's a play, and the director wants me doing scene work.
You seem to be doing a lot of writing.
Well, I seem to be getting a lot of direction, William.
Tell you what.
You got a great voice.
You ever do any voice-over work?
Well, you should.
Really.
I mean, you could be a... like a...
like a...
like an owl in a Pixar movie,
- right?
- Yeah.
No offense.
Not sure why I would take offense to that.
I don't do blueberries.
- Me neither.
- Since when?
- Since now.
- Yeah.
It's not the taste, right?
It's the texture of the skin, it's gross.
Yeah.
I don't want blueberries either.
Yeah.
Understood.
Any other dietary restrictions
I should let the staff know about?
No, man.
You're busy.
I'll just, you know,
I'll make a list for you later when I get some time.
Thanks, buddy.
You need to put something in your stomach, William.
Toast, pills, juice.
That's the order.
Okay?
Is that medicine?
Do you have a cold, Grandpa?
- Grandpa's fine.
- No.
They're just vitamins.
So.
You, told the girls that he's Grandpa, but not that he's sick.
Right?
That's ballsy.
Hey, so, Kevin, it's been a few days now, you know, since you showed up.
Without calling.
Right.
And... and it's great to see you.
I was just sort of wondering...
How do I say this politely?
When are you leaving?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean, come on.
I can, I...
I can, um...
I can get out of here whenever.
I just...
I...
I saw this as an opportunity to hang with you two, you know, and the girls, but...
Plus I... honestly, this play, guys, it's kicking my ass a little, You know?
And it's so lonely at that hotel.
I mean, I got this big suite all to myself but I guess the bigger the hotel room, the emptier it can feel.
You know?
I'm sitting there.
I got that 800 thread count sheets.
I got the endless minibar snacks.
You got the fancy oatmeal soaps, plush robes and all I can do is sit there and think about how... quiet it is.
- We'll take it.
- What's that?
The hotel.
Beth and I, we'll take it, tonight.
- No, Randall.
- Where are we gonna
- get a sitter?
- No, We got two family members
- No, no, no, no, no.
- living in our house for free.
One of them played a nanny on TV.
- No.
- No, actually, an au pair.
Technically, I played an au pair on TV.
There's a difference.
A lot of people don't know that.
I was... an au pair.
They were gonna call the show,
What Au Pair, but The...
Manny tested better.
I-I can watch the girls.
- I'm-a go pack.
- Okay.
- I'm-a go pack right now.
- Wait.
Good morning.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Breakfast in bed?
Yeah.
What did I do to deserve this?
I don't know.
You've done a lot of really nice things for me, so I wanted to return the favor.
By cutting up cardboard into little squares and putting it in a bowl?
Those are cheese squares.
Yum.
Yeah.
What's on top?
Hemp seed.
Hemp seeds on top?
Boy, you really buried the lede.
Now I'm in.
What?
You're not gonna have any nonsense made-up food?
No.
Getting weighed at our meeting this afternoon.
You know what?
So am I.
I probably shouldn't eat, either.
Damn.
Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?
I was thinking miniature golf.
Last time,
I was like, 20 under going into the 18th, but that little windmill owns my ass.
I can't.
Steelers.
Sunday Night Football.
Saturday Night Football.
With who?
No one.
Just me.
- All right.
I'll watch with you.
- No.
Thanks, but I'm good.
Seriously?
You'd rather watch by yourself than watch with me?
Yeah.
It's my thing.
I have a little ritual.
You know?
It's my thing.
Well, your thing... is sad.
Not to me.
Okay.
Okay.
How about this?
You can watch football... all by yourself, which is totally normal, but with me.
Toby.
This is something that I do alone.
Okay?
Sure.
- Great.
Thank you for being so sweet.
- Yeah.
Can you bring, like, a bowl of sugar for this?
Thank you.
Go, Steelers!
Whoo!
Thank, God.
Can we please watch the game now?
The Rose Bowl is back.
Not an empty seat anywhere.
Hey.
- Excuse me.
- That was amazing.
- Yeah?
Really?
- Yeah.
Shelly, Miguel.
- There they are.
Hey!
- Yeah.
- So sorry we're late.
- It's okay.
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.
Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were just about to head out the door, and the baby decides to projective vomit
- all over little Andy.
- Yeah.
- Almost got me, too.
- So, what does Andy do?
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.
He slaps the baby.
Right across the face.
Pow!
- No!
Is she okay?
- She's fine.
Yeah.
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder, I'm screaming at Andy, and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,
Andy, she is a baby.
Like, you literally slapped a baby.
Which really helped, as you can imagine.
Of course, then Andy starts crying,
- baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
- We need drinks!
We need drinks.
We'll be right back.
Okay.
Wow.
Promise me we are never having kids.
I think it's time for shots.
26 is having a tough day.
The first half, the Rams, surprisingly,
- lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
- Pathetic.
Can't stop the run.
And Bradshaw sucks!
No, Bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.
Right, babe?
Yeah.
Big... big second half.
Are you okay?
Fine.
Okay.
Actually, no.
Um, what did you mean before when... when you said...
"Promise me we'll never have kids"?
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah, but... you did.
Kind of said it twice today.
And I shouldn't have.
Okay?
Sorry.
You know what we need to be doing?
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?
That's...
'Cause we-we never really talk about it.
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future, but it's the future now, Bec, and I want kids.
You know what, we're gonna
- go grab another drink at the bar.
- Okay.
and see how the fans...
Let's go to the Ginger Man and Paul Hornung.
L.A. fans have to be happy, Paul.
Bedtimes are at 8:00
- and 9:00... that's teeth brushed, in the bed. -00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien, and then lights out, right?
That's too far.
Okay, listen, relax.
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home.
Okay?
The girls are gonna play.
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.
My God, please, take care of my babies.
And, please, don't call us.
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.
One more thing, though, before you go.
So, Tess was the, the white wine drinker, right?
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.
- Piss them off.
- Thanks.
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...
- Yes.
- It's a little too far.
- He plays too much.
- It's okay.
- It's okay.
- He plays too much.
Hey, call us if you need anything.
Don't call us.
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control, so what I've been finding to be really helpful is if I... take the portion out of the box and then I put the portion onto the plate
- and then I put the box - Just pass it.
Away... and then I know... how... how many crackers
I'm allowed to-to have.
Just pass it.
To h... to have, so then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers, then I have the ten crackers on my plate, which is fine, but at the same time,
there are other crackers that I like than-than other crackers.
So, I might not like saltine crackers as much as I like a Cheez-It type cracker, but so, what I'll do with the Cheez-It type cracker is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,
but I'm still rationing, so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate, but there might be 20 if it's a Cheez-It.
But I still put the box away.
So, I-I mean
I-I think that's... that's a win.
Yeah.
She was always away on business.
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this... but this was a different kind of alone.
She was always away on business, so I was used to being... but... so, I was...
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone, but this was a different kind of alone.
You know?
This-this... is a different kind of...
I thought you two were watching a movie.
We want to have a Barbie fashion show.
Cool.
That sounds fun.
So, go play Barbie fashion show.
We need you to be the celebrity judge.
Right.
The thing is I can't because I got this rehearsal tomorrow and I really want to be off book, so...
What does "off book" mean?
Off book.
Off book means, means that I know my lines.
So, you... have Grandpa be the judge.
Grandpa's not a celebrity.
Yeah.
Their logic seems sound.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um... tell you what?
You want to, you want to help me?
You want to, you want to read the play with me?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Come on.
- Okay.
- Yeah, let's do that.
Come on, over here.
William,
- let's do it.
- I'm not much of an actor.
Doesn't matter.
I just need to get the lines down, so...
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.
You're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.
Why does she get to be Jessica?
Well, um, be...
Because you're Gracie, okay?
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.
It means you get to boss your sister around.
How's that sound?
So.
William, multiple questions.
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you,
- it's a little delicate.
- Go ahead.
Do you know how to read?
Yes, I can read.
I knew it.
I was joking.
Of course you know how to read.
Trying to be funny.
Okay.
So if you could please read the role of Brad.
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?
I have to pee.
I kind of do, too.
What are you...
Good God.
Now, this is what
I'm talking about.
Okay, babe, here's the plan.
Sex first.
Right away.
Loud, adult, no kids in the next room sex.
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.
We just need to get the job done.
And under no circumstances are we allowed to fall asleep afterwards watching House Hunters.
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping.
Right?
Ooh.
We'll do it in the shower.
That's good.
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.
And we'll order room service before.
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes and eat burgers...
No, wait...
spaghetti.
No, I like burgers better.
We will eat burgers in bed.
Ooh.
Now, the big question is... what to order on pay-per-view.
I already hope they, I hope they have that
Huge Grant-Meryl Streep movie that sounds like a black lady.
Come on.
Florence Foster Jenkins.
Baby, they already got Florence Foster Jenkins.
I'm late.
I'm a week and a half late, Randall, and I feel like crap.
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore and get a pregnancy test.
I'm bugging out, baby.
I need you to talk me down.
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, good.
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery, broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.
Thank you, that's so nice.
And, Kate, this is my good friend, Shooter.
- Shooter, Kate.
- Hey.
- Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you, too.
Great news.
You both love sports, so... sports party.
and the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday Night Football.
Bradshaw drops back.
Bradshaw's got time...
So, what do you think, Jack?
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.
You want to do this now?
Okay.
Let's do it.
So...
I am not enough for you.
Am I not enough for you, Jack?
- Okay, back to the bar?
- Yup.
I never said that.
I just meant we need to have this conversation at some point.
Okay.
And you want to do that right now, at Froggy's
- during the Super Bowl?
- Yes, please don't make us
- miss a second of your drama.
- Could you butt out?
Hey... babe, we joke about it.
We see people with kids and go,
"Thank God that's not us."
We joke about it.
Right?
Did I not get the joke?
I'm not...
Babe, you're right.
You are right.
And coming from the family that-that I did,
I definitely never saw myself having kids.
- Okay.
- But then I met you.
And, you know, we're j...
we're great together and I love our life.
But the older we get, the more I think that... the more I think there's got to be something bigger than just me and you.
Well, thank you very much for involving me in this huge invisible change of yours.
Huge.
Because you knew when you met me and married me that I did not want to be one of those women whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.
I was thinking more your sister.
You probably were.
- I'm... it's a bad joke.
- I'm not there yet, Jack.
I'm not there yet.
- I am only 29.
- Almost 30.
I know how old I am!
Hey, Sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?
- Could you just shut up for a second?
- Mind your business.
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.
- Wow.
- You got to learn some manners, pal.
You need to control your woman.
- You need to watch your mouth.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jack, sit down.
Come here.
It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.
Jack.
- God, Jack.
- Jack!
Jack.
No!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, we should really be having kids.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Yeah.
Like, how?
You take the pill every day like clockwork, right?
Yeah.
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?
No.
I...
I mean, I changed medications last month and there might have been, like, a brief window.
A brief window?
Sorry.
A brief window, Beth?
Did it not occur to you that that might be something
- you want to run by your husband?
- Well,
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.
Well, there goes Charleston.
Okay, I'm sorry, what?
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.
Forgive me, Randall, but what in the holy hell are you talking about?
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?
I saw something about it on CNN.
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.
Sometimes at work, I look up places on Zillow.
Okay.
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here's a riddle... who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time and maybe, maybe... start to remember who she was?
Yeah?
But now will have to split her time between a diaper station and a home office?
This girl, right here.
- It's two thumbs.
- What?
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say
"what has two thumbs and is
- Gonna be splitting time betw..."
- Shut up.
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.
Hey.
- Also, some Altoids.
- Please.
Look at that picture.
That is a vivid picture.
I feel like I'm at the game.
Over across the field, here.
Yeah.
It's a really nice TV...
What is this?
Plasma?
You know, I'm really not sure, but...
Hey, Toby!
Yeah?
Do you guys like
- jicama?
- Plasma or LED?
I... have no idea.
- Kate?
Jicama?
- What?
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?
Can... can you actually just move, Tob?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep.
The receiver's all set.
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle, and going for the end zone!
Hey.
Shooter, tell Kate about that time we accidentally went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.
You got to hear this.
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.
Toby, you paused the TV.
It's like, paused.
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.
No, this is a great story.
No.
O-Okay,
I know it's not a big deal, really, but I kind of like to watch sports as they happen live.
Probably just me, right?
- Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
- I don't know.
- tends to wait...
- Now we're behind the game!
Fast forward it!
Touch down!
And Heyward made it all alone down the left side...
That's great.
That's your team, right?
That's my fantasy team.
- What's that?
- You know what,
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
I'm actually not feeling good.
I'm gonna go ahead and go.
- No!
- Yeah...
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- No, Kate, stay.
Shooter...
- it was really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- What... wait, wait, wait.
- Seriously,
- thank you for the jicama.
- What...
I'll talk to you later.
What is happening?
You have to let her go, David.
This is crazy, man.
She's gone and she's never coming back.
You really never acted before?
Nope.
Voice like silk.
Yeah.
How am I supposed to move on, David?
No.
I'm David.
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?
And who made you the expert of moving on?
Or the expert of anything for that matter?
Is that how you're gonna do it?
No.
Good.
It's your line.
Tess, honey, you have the next line,
- pay attention.
- I-I'd rather you not move on.
I'm...
I'm obv...
I'm obviously not planning to.
It's not good.
Not as easy as it looks, is it?
- No.
- No.
Okay.
There she is!
Do you see her?
Who, David?
Did I see who?
Her!
She's right there.
And ever since she died, her ghost has been haunting me.
Hold up.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What's happening in this story?
You're not following the story?
Do you follow it?
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.
Um...
She died, right?
She's dead.
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.
So when you die you become a ghost?
No.
- No, no, no, no, no.
No.
- Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.
So what happens when you die?
What happens when you die?
Is... you die.
Forever?
Sure... or not.
I don't know.
Honey, here's the thing, you know, do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts?
Because I can...
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick, is Grandpa gonna die?
Why are you asking me this?
Yes?
Yes.
Soon?
Well, you know, I mean,
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...
No!
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
Look, I-I mean, I meant it, but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?
You two?
You're gonna die.
Mommy and Daddy are gonna die.
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna die?
- No....
Look, my gosh, Wil...
it is getting late.
It's bedtime, girls.
- Come on, girls.
- Yep.
Time to go to bed.
Sleep tight.
Thanks for all the help.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?
About, four months into her first pregnancy.
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.
She's right, pal.
Yeah.
She's totally right.
You can kiss this life good-bye.
Third and eight for Pittsburgh and Bradshaw.
What if she doesn't want kids?
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?
Yeah!
I got to go find Shelly.
That over the wrong shoulder.
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.
73 yards.
And the terrible towels will come out throughout the Rose Bowl.
Not much doubt about the best team.
Just been informed that the MVP for this contest as picked by Sport Magazine and their panel of voters is Terry Bradshaw.
This isn't the night I had planned.
I know.
Shall we look?
Wait.
Just, um, let's...
let's... let's give it like, 30 more seconds.
Okay.
You'll still be able to work more.
I can work less.
We'll get a nanny.
Or a manny.
God, no.
You know, if you still want
- that vacation house you can...
- I don't.
It's too much trouble.
Worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids using it for their who knows what?
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.
We do make good kids.
That we do, that we do.
The girls will love it.
They'll go nuts.
Hey.

It does work better with two thumbs.
Nah.
I like the way you do it.
Well...
I like your face.
Shall we do this?
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.
I got to go talk to the girls.
Go talk to the girls...
what am I gonna say?
You know, I am clearly not the man that needs to be talking to them about the intricacies of life and death.
It's...
You do that a lot.
I do what a lot?
Doubt yourself.
You were very good, Kevin.
On that show.
You watched The Manny?
Before I came here, I had one old television, got three channels.
I really liked that program.
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.
I liked the one where you lose the baby.
Geez.
- "Manny on Fire."
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no.
That was a...
That was a strong episode.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I never should have left that show.
I've...
I never should have come here, that's for sure.
Being an uncle, right, doing theater...
I'm not cut out for theater.
And there you go again.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?
You're the wise owl in a Pixar film.
I'm the dopey Labrador.
I'm a dying recovering addict.
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah, well, people love Labradors.
Said the wise owl.
You want to know what it is?
It's this play, right?
I mean, these people that I'm working with, wow, they're like next level smart.
I mean, they're brilliant.
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
You know, it doesn't ma...
it doesn't matter, it's...
You're just gonna think it's stupid.
Said the dopey Labrador.
We did it!
If it's between you and having kids, you win.
Every time.
No question.
My father, he loved football more than anything.
Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.
But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.
As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.
I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.
Except I-I'd let them talk... as loud as they wanted.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
God, there's nothing wrong with you, Bec.
All of my friends my age have kids.
Every single one of them.
And... maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at Froggy's and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.
I don't know.
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
I see us with kids, Jack.
Yeah.
I just...
I love our life.
I love it right now.
And I'm so scared of changing it.
I don't want to change it.
Okay?
I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.
Okay?
What we have together, you and me.
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.
I just...
I just want you.
The Steelers won the Super Bowl.
Steelers won the Super Bowl.
Bradshaw won MVP.
My man.
Yes.
I am.
You are.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Okay.
So... what was all that about today?
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.
Then why did you agree to come over?
I don't know.
'Cause I didn't want to... seem like a weirdo.
Okay.
So, now I know.
No hanging out on Sundays during football season.
- I got it.
- But it's not just about football.
Okay.
What's it about then?
Okay.
So, growing up,
I used to watch the Steelers with my dad.
Right?
Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.
It wasn't until the 2006 AFC Championship when they played the Broncos.
Do you remember?
No.
Okay.
Anyway,
I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.
And I did.
And they won.
And then they won the Super Bowl.
And I just...
It's just-just what I do now.
I watch the Steelers, and...
I watch 'em with my dad.
He sounds like a cool guy.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Um...
- All right.
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.
This is your dad?
Jack.
Wow.
I know it sounds crazy and lame, but football is a really big part of my family.
Like, really big.
Like, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for football.
I was conceived in a bathroom during the Super Bowl.
Hi.
Sorry if I was a jerk before.
You're really not gonna forgive me?
Okay.
Um... what if I told you a-a secret that I've never shared with anyone before?
We're listening.
Okay.
All right.
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.
Is this about you dating Demi Lovato?
Because everyone knows.
No.
You know what, it's not about Demi Lovato, and we were just friends.
I just...
Sometimes I... paint.
Now, no one knows this, not even your Aunt Kate, but... when I get a script, the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.
Um...
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.
So...
I think I scared you before.
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.
All that adult stuff we were reading about.
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.
So, you know,
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting, tell you what I think my play is about.
Because I was thinking, um, that it might make us all feel a little bit better.
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?
So, um...
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?
And life is full of color.
And we each get to come along and we add our own color to the painting.
You know?
And even though it's not very big, the painting, you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction.
So, like, to infinity, you know?
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?
And it's really crazy, if you think about it, isn't it, that, a hundred years ago, some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase.
He has a son, who has a son, who has me.
So, at first, when I was painting, I was thinking, you know, maybe up here, that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know, down here, that's my part of the painting.
And then I started to think, well, what if... we're all in the painting, everywhere?
And-and what if we're in the painting before we're born?
What if we're in it after we die?
And these colors that we keep adding, what if they just keep getting added on top of one another, until eventually we're not even different colors anymore?
We're just... one thing.
One painting.
- Lucky cap.
- Lucky cap.
I mean, my dad is not with us anymore.
He's not alive, but he's with us.
He's with me every day.
It all just sort of fits somehow.
And even if you don't understand how yet, people will die in our lives, people that we love.
In the future.
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe years from now.
I mean, it's kind of beautiful, right, if you think about it, the fact that just because someone dies, just because you can't see them or talk to them anymore, it doesn't mean they're not still in the painting.
I think maybe that's the point of the whole thing.
There's no dying.
There's no you or me or them.
It's just us.
And this... sloppy... wild, colorful, magical thing that has no beginning, it has no end... this right here...
I think it's us.

So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control, so what I've been finding to be really helpful is if I... take the portion out of the box and then I put the portion onto the plate
- and then I put the box - (whispering):
Just pass it.
Away... and then I know... how... how many crackers
I'm allowed to-to have.
(whispering):
Just pass it.
To h... to have, so then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers, then I have the ten crackers on my plate, which is fine, but at the same time,
there are other crackers that I like than-than other crackers.
So, I might not like saltine crackers as much as I like a Cheez-It type cracker, but so, what I'll do with the Cheez-It type cracker is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,
but I'm still rationing, so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate, but there might be 20 if it's a Cheez-It.
But I still put the box away.

I-I think that's... that's a win.

We see people with kids and go,
"Oh, thank God that's not us."
We joke about it.
Right?
Did I not get the joke?
I'm not...
Babe, you're right.
You are right.
And coming from the family that-that I did,
I definitely never saw myself having kids.
- Okay.
- But then I met you.
And, you know, we're j...
we're great together and I love our life.
But the older we get, the more I think that... the more I think there's got to be something bigger than just me and you.
Well, thank you very much for involving me in this huge invisible change of yours.
Huge.
Because you knew when you met me and married me that I did not want to be one of those women whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.
I was thinking more your sister.
Oh.
You probably were.
- I'm... it's a bad joke.
- I'm not there yet, Jack.
I'm not there yet.
- I am only 29.
- Almost 30.
I know how old I am!
Hey, Sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?
- Could you just shut up for a second?
- Mind your business.
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.
- Wow.
- You got to learn some manners, pal.
You need to control your woman.
- You need to watch your mouth.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jack, sit down.
Come here.
It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.

Yeah, we should really be having kids.

Aren't you gonna say anything?
Uh, yeah.
Like, how?
You take the pill every day like clockwork, right?
Yeah.
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?
No.
I...
I mean, I changed medications last month and there might have been, like, a brief window.
A brief window?
Sorry.
A brief window, Beth?
Did it not occur to you that that might be something
- you want to run by your husband?
- Well,
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.
Well, there goes Charleston.
Okay, I'm sorry, what?
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.
Oh, forgive me, Randall, but what in the holy hell are you talking about?
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?
I saw something about it on CNN.
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.
Sometimes at work, I look up places on Zillow.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here's a riddle... who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time and maybe, maybe... start to remember who she was?
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
But now will have to split her time between a diaper station and a home office?
This girl, right here.
- It's two thumbs.
- What?
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say

Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.

But she keeps coming back as a ghost.

No.

No.

What happens when you die?
Uh, is... you die.
Forever?
Sure... or not.

Honey, here's the thing, you know, do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts?

Yes?
Yes.

But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.
As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.
I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.
Except I-I'd let them talk... as loud as they wanted.

Miguel:
Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were just about to head out the door, and the baby decides to projective vomit all over little Andy.
Yeah.
Almost got me, too.
So, what does Andy do?
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.
He slaps the baby.
(Gasps) Right across the face.
Pow!
No!
Is she okay?
Oh, she's fine.
Yeah.
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder, I'm screaming at Andy, and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,
Andy, she is a baby.
Like, you literally slapped a baby.
Which really helped, as you can imagine.
Shelly:
Of course, then Andy starts crying, baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
Miguel:
We need drinks!
Weneeddrinks.
We'll be right back.
Rebecca:
Okay.
Wow.
Promise me we are never having kids.
(Groans)
I think it's time for shots.
TV sports announcer:
Somebody's down.
Announcer 2:
26 is having a tough day.
Announcer:
The first half, the rams, surprisingly, lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
Miguel:
Pathetic.
Can't stop the run.
Oh, and bradshaw sucks!
Oh, no, bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.
Right, babe?
Yeah.
Big...
Big second half.
Are you okay?
Mm.
Fine.
Okay.
Actually, no.
Um, what did you mean before when, uh...
When you said... (Chuckles): "Promise me we'll never have kids"?
(Chuckles):
Oh.
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah, but... you did.
Kind of said it twice today.
And I shouldn't have.
Okay?
Sorry.
You know what we need to be doing?
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?
That's...
'Cause we-we never really talk about it.
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future, but it's the future now, bec, and I want kids.
Shelley:
You know what, we're gonna go grab another drink at the bar.
Okay.
Sports announcer:
...And see how the fans...
Let's go to the ginger man and Paul hornung.
(Sighs)
L.A. fans have to be happy, Paul.
Beth:
Bedtimesareat 8: 00 and 9:00-- that's teeth brushed, in the bed.
8:00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien, and then lights out, right?
That's too far.
Okay, listen, relax.
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home.
Okay?
The girls are gonna play.
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.
Oh, my God, please, take care of my babies.
And, please, don't call us.
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.
Oh, one more thing, though, before you go.
So, Tess was the, uh, the white wine drinker, right?
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.
Piss them off.
(Under breath):
Thanks.
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...
Yes.
It's a little too far.
He plays too much.
It's okay.
It's okay.
He plays too much.
Hey, call us if you need anything.
(Whispering):
Don't call us.
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control, so what I've been finding to be really helpful (Mouthing)
Is if I...
Take the portion out of the box and then I put the portion onto the plate and then I put the box (Whispering):
Just pass it.
Away... and then I know...
How... how many crackers
I'm allowed to-to have.
(Whispering):
Just pass it.
To h... to have, so then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers, then I have the ten crackers on my plate, which is fine, but at the same time,
there are other crackers that I like than-than other crackers.
So, I might not like saltine crackers as much as I like a cheez-it type cracker, but so, what I'll do with the cheez-it type cracker is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,
but I'm still rationing, so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate, but there might be 20 if it's a cheez-it.
(Mouthing)
But I still put the box away.
So, i-i mean i-i think that's...
That's a win.
Man:
Yeah.
(Applause)
(Mouthing)
She was always away on business.
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this...
But this was a different kind of alone.
She was always away on business, so i was used to being...
But...
So, I was...
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone, but this was a different kind of alone.
You know?
This-this...
Is a different kind of...
I thought you two were watching a movie.
We want to have a Barbie fashion show.
Oh, cool.
That sounds fun.
So, go play Barbie fashion show.
We need you to be the celebrity judge.
Right.
Uh, the thing is I can't because I got this rehearsal tomorrow and I really want to be off book, so...
What does "off book" mean?
Off book.
Off book means, uh, means that I know my lines.
So, uh, you, uh...
Have grandpa be the judge.
Grandpa's not a celebrity.
Yeah.
Their logic seems sound.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um... tell you what?
You want to, you want to help me?
You want to, you want to read the play with me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
Come on, over here.
William, let's do it.
I'm not much of an actor.
Oh, doesn't matter.
I just need to get the lines down, so...
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.
Why does she get to be Jessica?
(Chuckles) Well, um, be...
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.
It means you get to boss your sister around.
How's that sound?
So.
William, multiple questions.
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's a little delicate.
Go ahead.
Do you know how to read?
Yes, I can read.
I knew it.
I was joking.
Of course you know how to read.
(Chuckles)
Trying to be funny.
Okay.
So if you could please read the role of Brad.
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?
I have to pee.
Oh, I kind of do, too.
What are you... oh, good God.
(Chuckles)
Mm.
Now, this is what
I'm talking about.
Okay, babe, here's the plan.
Sex first.
Right away.
Loud, adult, no kids in the next room sex.
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.
We just need to get the job done.
And under no circumstances are we allowed to fall asleep afterwards watching house hunters.
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping.
Right?
Ooh.
We'll do it in the shower.
That's good.
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.
And we'll order room service before.
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes and eat burgers...
No, wait-- spaghetti.
No, I like burgers better.
We will eat burgers in bed.
Ooh.
Oh.
Now, the big question is...
What to order on pay-per-view.
Oh, I already hope they, uh, I hope they have that huge grant-meryl streep movie that sounds like a black lady.
Come on.
FlorencefosterJenkins.
Baby, they already got FlorencefosterJenkins.
I'm late.
I'm a week and a half late, Randall, and I feel like crap.
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore and get a pregnancy test.
I'm bugging out, baby.
I need you to talk me down.
Oh.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, good.
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery, broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.
Thank you, that's so nice.
Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is my good friend, shooter.
Shooter, Kate.
Hey.
Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, too.
Great news.
You both love sports, so...
Sports party.
Al Michaels:
...And the Kansas City chiefs on Sunday night football.
Commentator:
Bradshaw drops back.
Bradshaw's got time... (Crowd exclaims)
So, what do you think, Jack?
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.
You want to do this now?
Okay.
Let's do it.
So...
I am not enough for you.
Am I not enough for you, Jack?
Okay, back to the bar?
Yup.
I never said that.
I just meant we need to have this conversation at some point.
Okay.
And you want to do that right now, at froggy's during the super bowl?
Yes, please don't make us miss a second of your drama.
Could you butt out?
Hey...
Babe, wejokeaboutit.
We see people with kids and go,
"oh, thank God that's not us."
Wejokeabout it.
Right?
Did I not get the joke?
I'm not...
Babe, you're right.
You are right.
And coming from the family that-that I did,
I definitely never saw myself having kids.
Okay.
But then I met you.
And, you know, we're j... we're great together and I love our life.
But the older we get, the more I think that...
The more I think there's got to be something bigger than just me and you.
Well, thank you very much for involving me in this huge invisible change of yours.
Huge.
Because you knew when you met me and married me that I did not want to be one of those women whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.
I was thinking more your sister.
Oh.
You probably were.
I'm... it's a bad joke.
I'm not there yet, Jack.
I'm not there yet.
I am only 29.
Almost 30.
I know how old I am!
Hey, sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?
Could you just shut up for a second?
Mind your business.
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.
Wow.
You got to learn some manners, pal.
You need to control your woman.
You need to watch your mouth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jack, sit down.
Come here.
It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.
Jack.
(Grunts)
God, Jack.
Jack!
Jack.
No!
No, no, no, no.
(Indistinct chatter)
Yeah, we should really be having kids.
(Low, indistinct conversations)
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Uh, yeah.
Like, how?
You take the pill every day like clockwork, right?
Yeah.
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?
No.
I...
I mean, I changed medications last month and there might have been, like, a brief window.
A brief window?
Sorry.
A brief window, Beth?
Did it not occur to you that that might be something you want to run by your husband?
Well,
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.
Well, there goes Charleston.
Okay, I'm sorry, what?
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.
Oh, forgive me, Randall, but what in the holy hell are you talking about?
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?
I saw something about it on CNN.
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.
Sometimes at work, i look up places on zillow.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here's a riddle-- who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time and maybe, maybe...
Start to remember who she was?
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
But now will have to split her time between a diaper station and a home office?
This girl, right here.
It's two thumbs.
What?
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say
"what has two thumbs and is mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Gonna be splitting time betw..." Shut up.
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.
Hey.
Also, some altoids.
Please.
Shooter:
Look at that picture.
That is a vivid picture.
I feel like I'm at the game.
Announcer:
Over across the field, here.
Yeah.
It's a really nice TV...
What is this?
Plasma?
Led?
You know, I'm really not sure, but...
Hey, Toby!
Toby:
Yeah?
Uh, do you guys like jicama?
Plasma or led?
Toby:
I...
Have no idea.
Kate?
Jicama?
What?
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?
Can... can you actually just move, tob?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep.
Announcer:
The receiver's all set.
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle, and going for the end zone!
(TV beeps) Toby:
Hey.
Shooter, uh, tell Kate about that time we accidentally went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.
(Laughing):
Oh...
(Toby laughing)
Uh, you got to hear this.
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.
Toby, you paused the TV.
It's like, paused.
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.
No, this is a great story.
No.
O-okay,
I know it's not a big deal, really, but I kind of like to watch sports as they happen live.
Probably just me, right?
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
I don't know.
Announcer: ...
Tends to wait...
Now we're behind the game!
Fast forward it!
Announcer:
Touch down!
And heyward made it all alone down the left side...
That's great.
That's your team, right?
That's my fantasy team.
What's that?
You know what,
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
I'm actually not feeling good.
I'm gonna go ahead and go.
Oh, no!
Yeah...
Are you sure?
Yeah.
No, Kate, stay.
Shooter...
It was really nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What... wait, wait, wait.
Seriously, thank you for the jicama.
What...
I'll talk to you later.
What is happening?
You have to let her go, David.
This is crazy, man.
She's gone and she's never coming back.
Whew.
(Scoffs)
You really never acted before?
Nope.
Voice like silk.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
How am I supposed to move on, David?
No.
I'm David.
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?
And who made you the expert of moving on?
Or the expert of anything for that matter?
Is that how you're gonna do it?
No.
Good.
It's your line.
Uh,
Tess, honey, you have the next line, uh...
Pay attention.
I-I'd rather you not move on.
I'm--
I'm obv-
- I'm obviously not planning to.
It's not good.
Not as easy as it looks, is it?
No.
No.
Okay.
There she is!
Do you see her?
Who, David?
Did I see who?
Her!
She's right there.
And ever since she died, her ghost has been haunting me.
Hold up.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What's happening in this story?
You're not following the story?
Do you follow it?
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.
Um... (Muttering)
Mm-hmm.
She died, right?
She's dead.
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.
So when you die you become a ghost?
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.
So what happens when you die?
What happens when you die?
Uh, is... you die.
Forever?
Sure... or not.
I don't know.
Honey, here's the thing, you know, do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts?
Because I can...
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick, is grandpa gonna die?
(Whispering):
Why are you asking me this?
Yes?
Yes.
Soon?
Well, you know, I mean,
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...
(Clears throat)
No!
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
Look, i-i mean, I meant it, but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?
You two?
You're gonna die.
Mommy and daddy are gonna die.
Mommy and daddy are gonna die?
Kevin:
No.
Uh...
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, wil...
It is getting late.
It's bedtime, girls.
William:
Come on, girls.
Kevin:
Yep.
Time to go to bed.
Uh, sleep tight.
(Exhales)
Thanks for all the help.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
(Football game playing on TV)
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?
Uh, about, uh, four months into her first pregnancy.
(Chuckles)
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.
She's right, pal.
Yeah.
She's totally right.
You can kiss this life good-bye.
Summerall:
Third and eight for Pittsburgh and bradshaw.
What if she doesn't want kids?
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?
(Crowd cheering on TV)
(Cheering and whooping)
(Cheering) Yeah!
I got to go find Shelly.
TV commentator:
That over the wrong shoulder.
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.
73 yards.
(Cheering and whooping continues)
* *
summerall (On TV):
And the terrible towels will come out throughout the rose bowl.
Not much doubt about the best team.
* *
summerall (On TV):
Justbeeninformed that the mvp for this contest as picked by sport magazine and their panel of voters is Terry bradshaw.
This isn't the night i had planned.
I know.
(Sighs)
Shall we look?
Wait.
Just, um, let's...
let's...
Let's give it like, 30 more seconds.
Okay.
(Sighs)
You'll still be able to work more.
I can work less.
We'll get a nanny.
Or a Manny.
God, no.
You know, if you still want that vacation house you can...
I don't.
It's too much trouble.
Worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids using it for their who knows what?
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.
We do make good kids.
That we do, that we do.
The girls will love it.
Oh, they'll go nuts.
Hey.
Hmm?
What has two thumbs and loves his wife so much it hurts?
(Clicks tongue)
Oh, it does work better with two thumbs.
Nah.
I like the way you do it.
Mm.
Well...
I like your face.
Shall we do this?
(Footsteps)
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.
I got to go talk to the girls.
Go talk to the girls-- what am I gonna say?
You know, I am clearly not the man that needs to be talking to them about the intricacies of life and death.
It's... (Chuckles)
Ah.
(Exhales)
You do that a lot.
I do what a lot?
Doubt yourself.
You were very good, Kevin.
On that show.
You watched the Manny?
Before I came here, i had one old television, got three channels.
I really liked that program.
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.
I liked the one where you lose the baby.
(Laughing):
Oh, geez.
"Manny on fire." Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no.
That was a...
That was a strong episode.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I never should have left that show.
I've...
I never should have come here, that's for sure.
Being an Uncle, right, doing theater...
I...
I...
(Scoffs)
I'm not cut out for theater.
And there you go again.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?
You're the wise owl in a pixar film.
I'm the dopey labrador.
I'm a dying recovering addict.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, well, people love labradors.
Said the wise owl.
You want to know what it is?
It's this play, right?
I mean, these people that I'm working with, wow, they're like next level smart.
I mean, uh, they're brilliant.
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
You know, it doesn't ma-- it doesn't matter, it's...
You're just gonna think it's stupid.
Said the dopey labrador.
(Car horns honking, people whooping)
Man:
We did it!
(Cheering, whooping)
If it's between you and having kids, you win.
Every time.
No question.
My father, he loved football more than anything.
Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.
But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.
As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.
I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.
Except i-I'd let them talk...
As loud as they wanted.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
God, there's nothing wrong with you, bec.
All of my friends my age have kids.
Every single one of them.
And...
Maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at froggy's and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.
I don't know.
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
I see us with kids, Jack.
Yeah.
I just...
I love our life.
I love it right now.
And I'm so scared of changing it.
I don't want to change it.
Okay?
I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.
Okay?
What we have together, you and me.
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.
I just...
I just want you.
(Sighs)
The steelers won the super bowl.
Steelers won the super bowl.
(Sniffles)
Bradshaw won mvp.
My man.
Yes.
I am.
You are.
* *
hey.
Hey.
Okay.
So, uh...
What was all that about today?
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.
Then why did you agree to come over?
I don't know.
'Cause I didn't want to...
Seem like a weirdo.
Okay.
So, now I know.
No hanging out on Sundays during football season.
I got it.
But it's not just about football.
Okay.
What's it about then?
Okay.
So, growing up,
I used to watch the steelers with my dad.
Right?
Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.
It wasn't until the 2006 afc championship when they played the broncos.
Do you remember?
No.
Okay.
Anyway,
I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.
(Chuckles)
And I did.
And they won.
And then they won the super bowl.
And I just...
It's just-just what I do now.
I watch the steelers, and...
I watch 'em with my dad.
He sounds like a cool guy.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um...
All right.
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.
Uh...
This is your dad?
Jack.
Wow.
I know it sounds crazy and lame, but football is a really big part of my family.
Like,reallybig.
Like,I wouldn'tevenbehere ifitwasn'tfor football.
Iwasconceived ina bathroom duringthesuperbowl.
* *
(knocking lightly)
Hi.
Sorry if I was a jerk before.
You're really not gonna forgive me?
Okay.
Um...
What if I told you a-a secret that I've never shared with anyone before?
Hmm?
We're listening.
Okay.
All right.
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.
Is this about you dating demi lovato?
Because everyone knows.
No.
You know what, it's not about demi lovato, and we were just friends.
I just...
Sometimes I... paint.
Now, no one knows this, not even your aunt Kate, but... when I get a script, the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.
Um...
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.
So...
I think I scared you before.
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.
All that adult stuff we were reading about.
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.
So, uh, you know,
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting, tell you what I think my play is about.
Because I was thinking, um, that it might make us all feel a little bit better.
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?
So, um...
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?
And life is full of color.
And we each get to come along and we add our own color to the painting.
You know?
And even though it's not very big, the painting, you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction.
So, like, to infinity, you know?
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?
Andit'sreallycrazy,if youthinkaboutit, isn 'tit, that,a hundredyearsago , someguy thatI nevermetcameto thiscountrywithasuitcase.
* *
hehasason , whohasason , whohasme .
So, at first, when I was painting, I was thinking, you know, maybe up here, that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know, down here, that's my part of the painting.
And then I started to think, well, what if...
We're all in the painting, everywhere?
And-andwhatif we 'rein the painting before we're born?
Whatifwe 'rein it afterwedie?
Andthesecolors thatwekeepadding, whatiftheyjustkeep getting addedontopofoneanother, untileventuallywe 'renot evendifferentcolorsanymore?

- We need blood.
- So I've heard.
Human blood.
Everything's out of control.
We were fools to believe Valentine was dead.
[Jace] Previously on Shadowhunters...
My sister wants you to be her defense attorney.
For the right price.
- Name it.
- You.
[Jace] Clary, if you don't help us, no one survives.
Do you understand?
[Clary] Mom, please, wake up.
- You're out of order.
- This whole thing is out of order.
I am your father, Clary.
And Jace's.
- They're brother and sister.
- That means they can't...
You'll be lonely all your life.
Neither of you deserve it.
And I don't either.
Bring the flowers out to the wedding tent.
Put the lilies up on the dais, and lay the rose petals at the entrance.
Isabelle, which color do you like better?
It's for the curtains adorning the wedding tent.
Hmm.
The cobalt blue.
It's elegant, masculine... very Alec.
[woman] I'll put the cobalt blue out right away.
How are we supposed to get any work done with all this going on?
[sighs] We haven't had a wedding here in years.
- People are allowed to be excited.
- We need to focus.
Have you narrowed down the list of warlocks more powerful than Magnus Bane?
[sighs]
I've got it down to 20.
But it's gonna be hard to figure out which one cast that spell on Jocelyn.
I don't care how tough it is, we've gotta find him.
Back at Renwick's, I let Valentine go.
I won't make that mistake again.
We gotta wake up Jocelyn, in case she heard anything about his plan.
Have you spoken to Alec?
He's probably busy, what with wedding plans and all.
And I don't need to talk to anyone.
Let's just stick to the mission, okay?
She looks so peaceful now.
I just wish I knew how to reach her.
She's gonna be fine.
I'm sorry, Clary.
We should have told you everything before this got...
Luke, we can hash all that out when we wake Mom up.
The important thing now is that we have her back.
I'm looking for Lydia.
Have you seen her?
- I don't mean to interrupt your...
- No, stay for a minute.
I gotta get back to the station.
- Call me if anything changes?
- Yeah.
[sighs]
So, how is she?
The same, I guess.
[inhales deeply]
Alec, I know you and I don't always see eye to eye on things...
Actually, we never see eye to eye on anything, but I do want to thank you for everything you've done to get my mom back.
Actually I...
I should thank you.
I don't know what would have happened to Isabelle after the trial if you hadn't returned the Cup.
You saved my sister,
- so thank you.
- [inhales deeply]
Yeah, my whole world turned upside down, but, um,
- you and I thanking each other...
- [chuckles softly] ... that's... that's too much. [Chuckles] [scoffs] Yeah.
[cell phone vibrating] [sighs]
Magnus needs to speak with me.
He might have some information about how to wake your mother up or... stop Valentine.
It's important.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Hello...
Magnus?
You said you needed to talk to me.
[Magnus] Nice to see you, Alec.
I wasn't sure if you'd come.
You know how I hate to drink alone. [Chuckles]
I didn't come here to drink.
[sighs] Do you have any information...
On the warlock who cast a spell on Jocelyn?
I'm looking into it.
But... we never really finished our conversation after Izzy's trial.
About your wedding?
There's no conversation to be had.
I'm getting married.
You and I, we understand marriage very differently.
I'm a Shadowhunter.
This is about family, and tradition, honor...
Honor?
Where's the honor in living a lie?
What are you talking about?
What about love?
Even Shadowhunters fall in love, Alec.
Just tell me you're in love with Lydia, and I'll stop.
I don't know.
Why do you keep pushing?
[stammering]
You're confusing me.
Confusion is part of it.
That's how you find out if something's there.
Emotions are never black and white.
They're more like symptoms.
You lose your breath every time they enter a room.
[inhales deeply]
- [fingers snapping] - [exhales]
Your heart beats faster when they walk by.
Your skin tingles when they stand close enough to feel their breath.
[exhales]
[sighs]
I know you feel what I feel, Alec.
[scoffs]
You don't have any clue what I feel... so back off.
This is all just a game to you, isn't it?
You flirt, you laugh, you use magic, but at the end of the day, what do you risk?
Even if I did feel something for you... you want me to give up my life for you?
I have to do what's right for me.
I could lose my family, my career, everything!
You just don't get it.
You have a choice to make.
I will not ask again.
[ringing]
Hey, Clary.
What's goin' on?
I just, uh, needed to hear your voice.
Are you okay?
You sound upset.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just... things are kind of weird with Jace right now, but
- we'll work it out.
- So how's your mom?
I mean, I can't believe you actually rescued her.
We still have to wake her up, but at least she's away from Valentine.
When can I see her?
How about tomorrow night?
She's here at the infirmary.
Plus, it's Alec's wedding, so... [chuckles] I'd love if you'd come as my date.
Really?
I... [stammers] See, I just assumed you'd want to go with Jace.
That's, uh... [sighs] not really in the cards right now.
Besides, you are the person I'm closest to in the world.
- Please come.
- I'd love to.
Um... [clears throat]
But I might be a little bit late, you know, with the sun and all. [Chuckles]
You are the best.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
[Jace sighs]
Morning.
Morning.
You just come from training?
Yeah.
I'm, uh, workin' on my right hook.
Good.
That's a good punch.
Yeah.
I'm, uh, I'm workin' on it.
While this conversation is no doubt scintillating, remind me why we couldn't do this at my place?
- At least there we'd have cocktails.
- It's 9:00 in the morning.
Oh, it's happy hour somewhere, my dear.
[Jace] We invited you here, Magnus, because Hodge can't leave the Institute.
He's an important part of this mission.
Well, then, where is our tardy little tutor?
There are certain individuals that I'd like to avoid,
- so let's make this quick.
- [Hodge] Pardon the delay, Magnus.
I was following up on a lead.
Now, we've narrowed down our list of warlocks to these three.
Why is Ragnor Fell up there?
He's not more powerful than I am.
Well, some would disagree.
He is older than you.
- Certainly not wiser.
- Who is Ragnor Fell?
[Jace] The former High Warlock of London.
And one of my oldest friends.
Very prickly, likes to keep to himself.
Okay, look.
We just need to figure out which one of these warlocks had enough access to Jocelyn that they could create the potion for her without anyone discovering what they'd done.
By the early '90s, Ragnor was a professor at the Shadowhunter Academy in Idris.
Isn't that when my mother lived there?
Could he have made the potion for her?
The little bugger!
That's why he hasn't responded to my fire message.
Ever since Valentine began hunting warlocks,
Ragnor's been holed up in his secret country house just outside of London.
For all I know, Ragnor suspected my fire message was a ploy by Valentine to lure him out of hiding.
We'll have to confront him face-to-face.
- You're going on this mission?
- [Magnus] Of course!
I'm the only one Ragnor trusts.
Besides, I've played my last hand here.
Even I know when to fold.
Magnus, I didn't know you were here.
That was the point.
[Lydia] We're just on our way to greet a few representatives of the Clave who arrived early for tomorrow's wedding.
How long are you staying?
What's going on here?
Nobody told me about a meeting.
Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom.
We're just bringing him back to the Institute.
How can I help?
We're just recovering a warlock, Alec.
We got this covered.
Besides, you have emissaries from the Clave to meet.
You don't want to tarnish your family's perfectly-crafted image now, do you?
[inhales sharply] Again, lovely seeing you, Magnus.
[chuckles softly]
[Jace sighs]
Get ready.
We leave in an hour.
Jace.
Jace, slow down.
We need to talk about this.
Talk about what?
We're good, okay?
No, we're not.
At least...
I'm not.
We need to talk about what Valentine said about us.
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
It happened.
I feel weird right now.
I get it.
I feel the same way, okay?
But... [inhales deeply]
Look, we didn't know, all right?
It's not our fault.
[sighs] I can't do this right now.
I'm sorry.
Now that the Clave has control of the Mortal Cup, thanks to your lovely bride to be,
Mom and Dad can come home now.
They arrive tonight.
I heard.
Max is staying with his tutors in Idris.
It's safer there.
Now with all the dignitaries arriving for the wedding,
Mom must be beside herself.
This wedding is becoming more of a headache than I had planned.
Alec, you don't have to go through with this if you don't want to.
It's what I want.
- Okay.
- Okay?
No big argument from you?
You stood by me through my trial, and now I'm standing by you, big brother.
And...
I'm throwing you a bachelor party.
- A what?
- A bachelor party.
I don't need a bachelor party.
No one needs a bachelor party, but I'm throwing you one anyways.
Actually, Jace should be the one throwing it, but considering everything he must be going through with Clary...
I don't wanna ask him to do anything.
- You know what I mean?
- I do.
Sisters can really drive you nuts sometimes.
[sighs]
Ragnor's house is just across these fields.
Let's make this quick.
We'll talk to Ragnor, then Portal him back to the Institute before anyone knows we're gone.
So... brother and sister, huh?
I don't wanna talk about it.
What, so we're just gonna be work buddies now?
All about the mission, and totally ignore
- the huge bomb that just dropped on us.
- Yeah, sounds like a plan.
- [Sighs]
- What do you want me to say, Clary?
That I was attracted to my sister?
Point of fact, brother and sisters are often attracted to each other.
I once knew this one couple in ancient Egypt...
Magnus, not helping.
Maybe this will all make sense when we wake up Jocelyn.
- Since she is Jace's mother as well, perhaps...
- Don't say that again.
Maryse is my mother.
[Clary sighs]
At best, Jocelyn is the woman who abandoned me.
[Clary] Hey, that is not true.
My mother would never abandon her son.
She thought you were dead.
Or maybe she just didn't want me.
- You don't know her, Jace.
- That's right, Clary, I don't.
Do you?
I'm sorry I asked!
I came with you to escape my relationship drama, not get a front row seat to yours.
- What was that?
- Nice try, Jace.
You're not getting out of this conversation that easily.
Look out!
[Clary gasping]
Ragnor put up wards to protect his lair.
Why is the fire green?
It's a wall of fire that only the pure of heart and intention can pass through.
Are you ready?
Jace?
[Whooshing]
Magnus?
Where are you?
[breathing heavily] [energy pulsating]
Ragnor Fell.
Ragnor?
Ragnor?
Hello?
Is anybody home?
I need your help.
Ragnor, I know you're here.
I just need to find my friends.
[clicking]
Nice try, Ragnor.
[grunts]
Well done...
Clary Fairchild.
I've been expecting you.
You have Jocelyn's talent, I see.
Only a true artist would notice the subtle changes in my eyes.
Yes, I know.
I need to work on not moving my eyes, you don't need to remind me.
You knew my mom?
So you made the potion that put her to sleep?
At her request, yes.
And I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me looking for the antidote.
Please, sit.
My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane.
They were with me, but I lost them in the fire.
Let me do this my way!
Your friends, are they true?
Magnus said he's known you for centuries.
He sent you a fire message.
This is not an act.
It is not an act!
It is essential.
Okay, what is your deal?
My friends are missing and if you can't help me,
- I'll find someone who can.
- What is it worth to you?
You find my friends and wake my mother...
- I'll give you anything.
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- [fingers snapping] - [gasps]
[Magnus sighs] Honestly, Ragnor, was that nonsense necessary?
Of course.
She offered me anything.
You were only up to a timeshare of your flat in Paris.
Yawn.
All right, enough with the warlock games.
Can you really wake my mother?
Not without the Book of the White.
What is the Book of the White?
[Magnus] It's an ancient book of warlock magic containing spells more powerful than... [chuckles] most warlocks could ever imagine.
I possessed the book when your mother came to me, and I used its contents to create the potion.
Regrettably, I no longer have the book.
I asked Jocelyn to hide it that Valentine might never find it.
Ragnor, please, I have to get my mom back.
Is there any way to get the Book of the White?
Possibly.
I may have something that can help us.
Won't be but a moment.
What do we do if he can't find the book?
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
It's a bit drab, isn't it?
- [demon roaring] - [Ragnor screams] [gasps] Ragnor!
Shax demon.
[Ragnor gasping]
Creature took me... by surprise.
How could a Shax demon get past Ragnor's wards?
It must have followed us.
Jumped through when the fire wall reset.
Be still, my little dear cabbage. [Gasping]
Your wounds are deep.
Hold on, please.
[gasping] [softly] No, no, no.
[Jace sighs]
For centuries, this man knew me better than anyone.
Magnus, I'm so sorry.
We have to leave, now.
We can't.
Not until we find whatever it is Ragnor said could help us locate the Book of the White.
It's too dangerous.
If one Shax demon found us,
- you can bet there are more on the way.
- We have to try!
We don't have time to scour through mountains of Ragnor's stuff.
[inhales deeply] [fingers snapping] [energy pulsating]
Get back to the Institute.
I'll transport everything back to my place, and find what you need.
Now, leave me to take care of my friend.
- [Clary] Magnus, I am...
- Go!
[sighs]
Jace, you're coming to Alec's bachelor party, right?
No.
He doesn't want me there, and I'm swamped.
You two seriously haven't worked things out yet?
There's nothing to work out.
If he wants to talk, we'll talk.
He's your parabatai.
We have more important things going on than a bachelor party.
Come with me.
We have a mole in the Institute.
We were attacked by a Shax demon when we went to see Ragnor Fell.
The attack couldn't have been coincidence.
Valentine must have been tracking us.
You don't think someone from the Institute told Valentine where you were going.
There's no other explanation.
No one here would betray us like that.
This is our family.
Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom.
We're bringing him back to the Institute.
Not everyone's family yet.
- I swear, if Lydia is the leak, I'm gonna...
- Slow down.
We don't know if she did anything yet.
And wrongfully accusing someone of a crime is dangerous.
Trust me, I've been through it.
Lydia was right there when we were talking about Ragnor Fell.
If she's not gonna admit what she did, I'm gonna make her admit it.
Jace, stop.
You are too worked up to talk to anyone right now.
Especially not an important envoy from the Clave.
Let me talk to Lydia.
If you accuse Alec's fiancée of treason, you will ruin whatever relationship you have left with him.
Clary's right, Jace.
If Lydia did this, she might not be so defensive with Clary.
She might let her guard down.
- Slip up.
- Fine.
But I wanna know everything she says.
It's perfect.
I love it.
I'm so glad.
Let me know if you need anything else.
- Your dress is stunning.
- Thank you.
I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield.
I think that's pretty normal.
[inhales] Lydia, I need to talk to you about something.
What is it?
Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.
It killed Ragnor Fell.
By the Angel...
Only a few people here at the Institute even knew we were going on the mission.
You overheard us this morning.
Then we were attacked.
If I was working for Valentine, don't you think I would have already given him the Mortal Cup?
I don't believe this.
Fellow Shadowhunters accusing me of high treason.
- Lydia, I'm not accusing you of anything.
- Of course you are.
Unless you have hard evidence to back your claims,
I believe this conversation is over.
Fine, but know this.
These people have become like family to me... and I protect my family.
I care about them too.
Why else would I be marrying Alec?
How well do you actually know him?
You're talking about Alec's feelings for Magnus?
- I'm not blind.
- If... if you're not in love with Alec, then why are you going through with this marriage?
Alec's love for his family and his desire to restore the Lightwood name has touched me in ways that I haven't felt in a very long time.
Alec is a man of honor... and I truly care about him.
But what about Alec's happiness?
Shadowhunters know that our duty to our family supersedes our personal desires.
Look, I know that you're still new to this world and our traditions may seem foreign to you,
- but I...
- Yeah, more like ice cold.
Alec should not have to give up who he is, or at least the chance to figure it out, just to please his family.
But Alec proposed to me.
This is what he wants.
[sighs]
How do I trust you?
You're Valentine's daughter... and I learned to trust you.
Nice.
Trim fit.
- It'll make it look like you work out.
- Isabelle.
[stammers] Is... is Clary okay?
She's fine. [Sighs]
I just need your advice on something.
First time for everything, huh?
You can go now, Stan.
What's up?
It's about Alec's bachelor party.
When you were a mundane, you went to one, right?
Well, I'm only 18, and I'm a vampire now, so...
But...
I know a thing or two. [Chuckles]
Simon... what makes a bachelor party... a bachelor party?
Well, there is a certain bridge and tunnel crowd that would say the answer to that is strippers. [Chuckles]
But, you know, there's no one right way to throw a bachelor party.
It... depends on who's there.
Like... they're really about best friends coming together and assuring each other that they're always gonna be best friends.
Even if one of them gets married.
So it's about solidifying the bonds with the people that are closest to you?
That, and a ton of drinking.
[chuckles] You have both of those, and your bachelor party will be a success.
[sighs]
How I loathe that photograph.
I must remember, chin down, eyes up.
Otherwise, I look like a squinty toad.
You're here.
You didn't think you'd be rid of me that easily, did you?
[chuckling] Oh, my dear friend,
I will always be here for you.
Now, please, put away that horrid photograph.
It commemorates a night I'd rather forget.
[chuckles] Oh, how I had to comfort you.
How I loved her.
I prayed she would love me the same, but she just laughed.
To Camille, immortals aren't supposed to feel true love.
She was so cynical.
Camille broke my heart.
You let her break your heart, my friend.
You're immortal... but she killed you.
[beeps] [inhales deeply] [cell phone beeps]
[sighs]
Ready?
A couple more steps.
[dance music playing]
We're almost there!
All right, Izzy... [sighs]
You trust me, don't you?
[scoffs] No, not really.
And I told you, I don't need a bachelor party.
[sighs] You need this one.
- [sighs]
- Now, count to five, and take your blindfold off.
Really, Izzy?
Seriously?
Izzy said you wanted to talk.
I don't know what she thought I wanted to say.
Great.
I guess I'll go.
I've got work to do anyway.
[exhales] Damn it, Izzy.
[sighs] You know what?
She's right.
We do need to talk.
Okay.
Well, it's my bachelor party, so you go first.
I don't know how things got so messed up between us.
But I do know my life has been a lot harder not having you to talk to.
[sighs] Mine, too.
I know it seems like I've been making a lot of crazy choices lately.
And I know you think that I was only thinking about myself... and Clary, and I wasn't thinking about the consequences to anyone else.
All I can say is, I've been going through a lot.
But I only ever did what I thought was right, Alec.
But I never wanted to hurt you.
I'm sorry.
[sighs] I know.
You know, we just...
- got caught in all this drama.
- Yeah. [Scoffs]
I mean... you're getting married tomorrow.
And Clary's your sister.
You know, what's up with that?
Hell.
Yeah, uh, don't even get me started on that.
[sighs]
I kissed her.
Mmm.
It's worse, I wanted her.
I was falling in love.
I must be sick or something.
I don't know.
No.
Nah.
You're not sick.
Situation's just...
It's confusing.
And trust me, I know.
You know, it's like, you have this plan for your life... right, and you know what you need to do and what your responsibilities are.
And you think, you know,
"If you follow the rules, everything's gonna be fine."
Then somebody comes along, and... [inhales] pushes you off that path.
You just...
Hey...
I get it.
The point is, we're Shadowhunters.
Emotions get in the way.
And if you get knocked off the path, you have to focus... and find your way back.
I mean, you still have to be true to yourself.
I am.
[sighs]
I'm fulfilling my duty.
[sighs]
Look, would you be my suggenes and give me away tomorrow?
Alec, if this is what you really want...
I'd be honored.
[sighs]
I'm always gonna be here for you.
Me, too.
[playing out of tune]
I wouldn't describe that as an instrument of music.
An instrument of torture, perhaps.
- Oh, you never liked the charango.
- No, I did not.
And I pray you don't play it.
Death has already given me enough of a headache.
Do you remember Imasu?
He played this so beautifully.
I'm surprised that lasted as long as it did.
He was always so much better looking than you.
[chuckles] I don't understand why you didn't go after the boy.
I'm certain, with very little effort, you could have won him back.
No.
Imasu wanted more than I can give.
Maybe Camille was right.
I am immortal.
I can party and have fun to my heart's content without the anchors of love around my feet.
[Ragnar] You are not Camille.
And though I know you won't believe me, someday someone will come along who will tear down those walls you've built around your heart.
And when that love comes back to you, you must do everything in your power to fight for it.
Going somewhere?
Even in death... you give the best advice.
Be nice if you took it more than once every 300 years.
I... [classical music playing]
When you first proposed to Lydia, I'll admit, I was wary.
But now... [inhales deeply]
you've made me so proud.
[sighs] All right, you're ready for this?
- As ready as I'll ever be.
- Good.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Wouldn't be anywhere else.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.
- Did I miss anything?
I left right at sunset.
- No, you're right on time.
- Cool.
- Simon, you look incredible.
[chuckles] Thanks.
I borrowed one of Raphael's suits.
Embracing the new me.
- So, how's your mom?
- She's good.
Uh, Luke's with her right now, watching over her.
[thudding]

[Chuckles] But I didn't think he'd show.
Magnus, leave this wedding now.
Maryse, this is between me and your son.
I'll leave if he asks me to.
Are you gonna be okay, buddy?
[sighs]
Alec?
Hey. [Chuckles]
[Alec breathing heavily]
I... [gasping] I can't breathe.
I know.
It's okay.
[breathing heavily]
I can't do this.
I thought we were doing the right thing, but... this isn't it.
You don't have to explain.
- Lydia, I'm sorry.
- Hey... you deserve to be happy.
[chuckles]
Okay?
I'll be fine.

What did I just do?
Alec, I am so proud of you.
Guys, that was incredible.
It was like watching the live version of The Graduate.
You know, the Dustin Hoffman movie?
The amazing one?
You were Ben.
[Mimics Ben] Elaine!
And you were Elaine.
I mean, a... a taller, masculine, handsome version of her.
But at the altar, though, you were like... [mimics Elaine] Ben!
[normal voice] And then... and then now, you're both sitting on the bus at the end of the movie, both totally stoked, but wondering, like... [inhales deeply] "What're we gonna do now?"
You know?
[Chuckles]
Who invited the vampire?
Seriously?
[Jace] Hey.
What you just did for Alec...
- I, um...
- It was the right thing to do.
So what are you gonna do now?
Head back to Idris. [sighs]
Dive into work.
There's no place for me here.
There's always gonna be a place for you here.
Give Alec and Magnus my best.
[Jace sighs]
Is Lydia gonna be okay?
She'll be all right.
- [Clary sighs]
- Look, Clary...
Listen, I just need to say that... you were right.
Seeing what Alec just did,
I realized I can't shut you out.
I just don't know what to do with all this.
Much as this will shock Alec, my visit tonight wasn't all for him.
We need to speak privately.
I pulled every item of magical importance from Ragnor's belongings.
But I can't determine which will lead to the Book of the White.
Wait, this bookmark.
I've seen it before.
In the alternate dimension you showed me a book of spells, and this was in it.
It must have been the Book of the White.
[Alec] If that's the case, we can use the bookmark to track the owner of the book.
Okay.
Warlock tracking is stronger.
[breathing deeply]
[Camille screaming] Let me out of here!
[gasps]
Well, there's good news and bad news.
The good news is I know the owner.
The bad?
- It's Camille.
- Camille?
Looks like Raphael has her locked up in the basement of the Hotel DuMort.
Well, after I punched her, there's no way she'll help me.
She won't have a choice.
Trust me.
[screams] [grunts]
[groaning] [footsteps approaching]
[straining]
Why'd you ask me up here, Clary?
I needed you to see this.
What is all that?
Luke told me that my mother had a son.
[sighs]
Jonathan Christopher.
- What's that?
- It's my name.
"JC."
Jace.
Short for Jonathan Christopher.
Jace, I know all of this is impossible to believe, but... our mother never abandoned you.
She thought you were dead.
This is all she had left, and she... she carried you with her every single day.
Is all this really mine?
[sighs]
I don't know who I am anymore.
There's darkness in me.
It's always been there.
And now I... [sighs]
When we rescued Jocelyn... and I let Valentine go...
I was tempted to go with him.
He's my father.
Maybe that's where I belong.
Jace...
I know you're a good man.
I don't know how, but we are going to make sense of all this.
I promise.
[exhales] I'm so glad we got away from that crowd and all those people.
So intense.
I have to hand it to you, Alexander... you certainly know how to make a statement.
[footsteps approaching]
What have you done, Alec?
To us, this family?
- This isn't about you.
- Of course it is.
You are either being selfish or naive.
This wedding was your plan from the start.
And now you have humiliated us in front of the most respected members of the Clave.
I don't even recognize you anymore.
I'm the same person I've always been.
Now everything's just out in the open.
And all for a Downworlder.
Just give her time.
[Alec inhales deeply]
And you?
I don't really understand this.
But I suppose our world is changing.
How long has this been going on?
Are you two in love?
[scoffs] Love?
What?
No.
No, it's... it's, uh, it's sort of a different...
It's not...
It's all very new.
Right.
[sighs]
I better go check on Mom.
[sighs]
You know what I just realized?
We still haven't gone on our date yet.
[scoffs]
Yeah, you're right.
[sniffs]
You wanna...
I don't know, get a drink sometime?
I would love that.
Great.
Looks like we missed the wedding of the year.
It's all right.
You and I will be able to share our love openly one day.
How is she?
She's asleep... but she's home.
You okay, Hodge?
Yeah.
You should get some rest.
You've been so vigilant.
Why don't you let me watch over her.
Thank you, my friend.
Of course.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
You have the Cup.
Help me break my Punishment rune... and I will bring it to you.
A deal is a deal.
Previously on Shadowhunters...
Jonathan Christopher.
"JC." Jace.
I don't know who I am anymore.
There's darkness in me.
In the alternate dimension you showed me a book of spells, and this was in it.
It must have been the Book of the White.
We can use the bookmark to track the owner of the book.
It's Camille.
I want my property back.
Simon is not your property.
Camille killed this mundane.
He's the evidence we need to show the Clave she's been breaking the Accords.
I'm getting married.
I'm a Shadowhunter.
This is about family, and tradition.
What about love?
I can't do this.
You have the Cup.
How could I not know?
I spent a lifetime not knowing who I was.
But, Jace, the one thing I know for sure is you are not a bad person.
You're not Valentine.
I should have killed him.
And yet I can't shake the feeling that he was right.
Jace, Valentine is my father, too.
We are the same...
No, we're not, Clary.
No, we are not.
Jocelyn raised you.
I was raised by Valentine, and a pair of baby booties isn't gonna change that.
Stop!
Look, I can't even begin to explain what happened in our past, but our mom can.
We are so close to waking her up.
You want answers as badly as I do, we have to go back to the Hotel DuMort and talk to Camille.
Fine.
Where's Simon?
Simon, wait!
What's going on?
We need your help.
The Book of the White.
It contains the spell that can wake my mom, but she hid it so Valentine can never find it.
We have a lead.
The Bookmark of the White?
It's a piece of the book itself.
Magnus tracked its owner to the Hotel DuMort, but... it belongs to Camille.
Okay, um...
I'll set a meeting with Raphael.
Thank you.
Have you spoken with Lydia?
No one's seen her since the wedding.
- Mom, come on.
- Maryse.
Mom, I understand you're upset, but this is...
Calling off the wedding would've been one thing... but kissing that warlock in front of the entire Institute?
You've embarrassed all of us.
- Why?
Because he's a guy?
- No.
The fact that he is a guy, as you say, is the least of my worries.
Then what's the problem?
That you chose Magnus Bane.
His reputation precedes him.
And even for a warlock, he's a bit of a lothario.
Alec, there's so much that you don't know about him.
Well, then I plan to get to know him.
And if you have a problem with that, then I suggest you deal with it.
Now, I have to go find Lydia.
She's probably packing for Idris in your father's office.
What she did...
Saved my life.
So I should go thank her.
On a scale of one to ten...
- how unpleasant was it?
- Off the charts.
Yeah, I've never seen them so angry.
Just give them some time.
You're immortal.
Time is on your side.
After what I did...
I don't think they'll ever forgive me.
Don't underestimate a parent's love.
You don't regret it, do you?
Everything happened so fast.
I didn't have time to think.
I just wanna make sure Lydia's okay.
Now I owe her so much.
We owe her.
What she did was nothing short of heroic.
Hey, look, maybe we can slow things down?
Why don't we start with that date you owe me?
Yeah, let's do that.
I know this great Ethiopian place on 44th...
Lydia!
Go get help.
You're gonna be okay.
Hodge...
How's Lydia?
Better.
Magnus is doing what he can to help her, but it's bad.
And the Cup is definitely missing.
So is Hodge.
Maybe he was attacked, too.
-Maybe he's the one who attacked her.
- Hodge?
No way.
We've known him our entire lives.
He would never do that to us.
I led him right to the Cup.
We treated him like family.
How could he do this to us?
That's how.
What is that ring?
Looks like he's talking to someone.
And I can bet who it is.
Valentine.
Well, that explains how he deactivated the Punishment rune, but it doesn't explain where he got the ring.
You think someone smuggled it past the wards?
Maybe.
Hodge wasn't the only ex-Circle member around here.
Look, I know I don't always see eye to eye with my parents, but I know they're not traitors.
Really?
Isn't that what you just said about Hodge?
It'd have to be someone we trusted, but if there was an intruder inside the Institute, we would have found them by now.
What about the Forsaken attack?
No.
We killed that thing, and I didn't see a ring.
He didn't have one during the autopsy, but... maybe there's something in the footage.
Go to the other camera.
-There.
So, it wasn't a random attack.
He was just the delivery boy.
If he gives that Cup to Valentine, he'll create an army of Shadowhunters.
With that kind of power behind him, he'll kill thousands.
He'll kill thousands just creating the army.
Most mundanes won't survive that.
We won't let that happen.
I'm gonna make sure of it.
I believe you have something that belongs to me.
As we agreed... old friend.
Oh.
You've done well, Starkweather.
You have earned your freedom.
Thank you.
It's been a long time since I've been able to breathe fresh air.
To see the outside world with my own eyes.
Well, take it all in.
The world is about to change.
Let the Cup purify this blood.
Only the worthy shall survive.
I'm ready.
Then drink.
Is he dead?
No.
He's a Shadowhunter.
Jace, what are you doing?
Every second we waste here, Hodge gets closer to Valentine.
Hey, we're a team, all right?
I know you're mad right now, but Hodge could be dangerous.
Two of us, one of him.
Check the math, but I'm pretty sure he's outnumbered.
What is with you?
Would you just talk to me for a second?
Lydia, Hodge...
All this is happening because I didn't stop Valentine.
Jace, you cannot let emotions cloud your judgment.
Your words, remember?
When I first wanted to find my mom, I didn't care about anyone else.
But you were the one that taught me that it's about a world that's bigger than us.
That's why you need to wake her up.
She was his prisoner... and his wife.
- If anyone can stop him, she can.
- Jace, listen to me...
You can do this.
Maybe I can.
But it's not about me, it's you I'm worried about.
You cannot let Valentine's evil poison you!
He's my father.
Actually... he's our father.
You don't get it.
Jace...
How are we gonna find Hodge?
He didn't leave anything we can track.
I might be able to ask Magnus for help.
You need to stop thinking with your stele, Alec.
There's more than one way to track.
This is my fault.
He walked right past me, Jace!
Yeah, if I'd have known...
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Hodge Starkweather.
Hunt him down.
I want him found and I want him alive.
Raziel's blood runs through your veins.
You're now the first in a new order of Shadowhunters.
I have given you great power... but I expect something in return.
Jonathan and Clarissa... find them.
What do you need Jace and Clary for?
We already have the Cup.
"We"?
Yes.
I promised you your freedom, Starkweather.
Nothing else.
Have I not proven my loyalty to you?
You've only proven your willingness to betray it.
Do you really think that I would allow a traitor into my ranks?
I brought you the Cup.
You've served your purpose.
Now you're free to go.
Free?
You promised me protection.
The Clave will never stop hunting me and you know that.
Well, now that I have the Cup, the Clave's days are numbered.
I'm a man of my word.
The Clave will no longer bother you.
And you will no longer bother me.
Now, I suggest you enjoy your freedom before I change my mind.
For Shadowhunters, you don't seem to do a lot of Shadowhunting.
There is more to the job than killing demons.
We need to talk to Camille.
We know you have her here.
We tracked her to the DuMort.
It's true, but I'm afraid she's a bit tied up at the moment.
Is there something I can help you with?
Just a second.
Look, I know this sounds crazy, but we have to let them talk to Camille.
She has a spell book that could wake up Jocelyn Fairchild.
Valentine might have the Cup.
The entire Downworld's in danger.
She's far too dangerous.
Or did you already forget what happened last time you "talked" to her?
It's not like she can kill me again.
You said it yourself... if Valentine has the Cup, the entire Downworld is at risk.
Camille will only make things worse.
I'll bring you what's left of Camille's things, but speaking to her is out of the question.
Her things?
This isn't the kind of book she would've just left sitting around.
I'm sorry... but that's the best I can do.
- We're supposed to be allies.
- And we are.
But Shadowhunters have no business interfering with the Night Children's affairs.
You may look to the Clave for justice, but the vampires look to me.
Camille stays where she is.
You're making a huge mistake.
Where is it?
Jace...
I'm afraid you're too late.
Valentine already has the Cup.
How could you?
It was the only way to earn my freedom.
I'd been caged long enough.
Caged?
You were our teacher.
We treated you like family.
We loved you!
Family?
Family?
The Lightwoods cut a deal, Jace, to have me punished for crimes that they themselves committed.
Don't you see?
I was their prisoner!
And besides... let's be real for a moment.
You can't win.
I taught you everything you know.
Not everything, Hodge.
- It's over!
- It's not over.
He's a traitor.
He deserves to pay.
- You nearly killed him!
- Maybe I should've killed him!
He sided with Valentine, Alec.
The Clave let him go once before and look where that got us.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill every ex-Circle member, even our parents?
Robert and Maryse aren't my parents.
You said it yourself.
They raised you.
They are your parents!
Just calm down.
There's a dungeon in Idris with your name written all over it.
It's good to see you, Jonathan.
I've been expecting you.
I figured you'd find Starkweather.
I've trained you well.
You don't know me.
I raised you.
We're not so different, you and I.
Hodge had it coming.
You kill innocent people.
I'd never do that.
Not yet.
But it's all a matter of time.
The Clave has failed us.
They've failed all of humanity, but you knew that as well as I did.
Every day, the demons get stronger, and soon... there won't be enough Shadowhunters to fight back.
The Cup can change that.
The Cup destroys more than it creates.
Our job is to protect the mundanes, not to kill them.
Well, losses are acceptable when the alternative is extinction.
But come with me.
Together we can use the Mortal Cup to save the world.
Oh, I am coming for you.
We have unfinished business.
So these are all of Camille's things?
All I could find.
But she has hideouts all over the city.
Interesting.
I thought you were looking for a spell book.
We are.
"We"?
Where are your friends?
Give me a second.
I gotta deal with this.
No one told me anything about a new prisoner.
That's because you're not advisor to the interim chapter president.
I mean, you can take it up with Raphael if you want, but, uh, I wouldn't... wouldn't wanna tell you what happened to the last guy that challenged him.
Don't go anywhere.
Did you really think this stall tactic was going to work?
No... but I thought this would.
Typical Shadowhunter...
always underestimating a vampire.
- Sure this will work?
- Izzy's a pro.
By the time that vamp finds Raphael, we'll be long gone.
Let's get this over with.
If anyone catches us, we're dead.
Some of us already are.
Alaric, we've got Hodge.
Call off the rest of the pack.
We're gonna need a pickup.
We're at the subway station near Bergen.
Yeah.
I'll see you in five.
- How's Hodge doing?
- He'll live.
It's Jace I'm worried about.
Valentine really messed with his head.
- What, at Renwick's?
- Yeah.
He went through a lot recently.
I thought we had settled it, but something's killing him inside.
- I don't know what it is.
- This is all too familiar.
I saw a similar thing with Valentine 18 years ago.
Jace isn't Valentine.
Not yet.
We gotta keep an eye on him.
All right.
- Where'd they go?
- What do you mean?
Once we open this, there's no going back.
Everything we've done to unite the Downworld goes out the window.
I wish there was another way, but if Valentine gets ahold of the Cup... there won't be a Downworld left to unite.
She's dead.
Well, yeah.
What'd you expect?
She's a vampire.
Not so fast.
What took you so long?
Excuse me?
I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before.
We're forever linked, you and I.
How do you know I don't want to stake you?
Do you?
No.
I do.
But that's not why we're here.
- Where's the Book of the White?
- The book of the what?
The Book of the White.
Big, white spell book.
Kind of explains itself.
- Never heard of it.
- And yet we tracked it to you.
Darling... what would I possibly want with a spell book?
We don't have time for this.
Put her back in.
Okay, okay, okay.
You said it was a warlock book?
Yeah.
I think my mom gave it to you.
She ran an antique store.
Vampires sell that sort of stuff, right?
All the time.
But if your mother was even half as charming as you,
I'm pretty sure I'd remember her.
What about Dorothea Rollins?
She was my mom's assistant.
Dot?
Oh, but of course.
She was our favorite customer.
So your entire life has been paid for by my antiquities.
I guess that means you owe me.
Do you know where it is or not?
It's in my apartment on the Upper East Side.
My own pied-à-terre.
I can take you there... but you'll have to get me out of here first.
Or you can leave me in here, and never get the book.
Totally up to you.
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm going after Valentine.
Go help Clary.
You're acting crazy.
All right?
Whatever Valentine's telling you, it's not true.
That's just it, Alec.
It is true.
He's my father.
He taught me how to fight.
Not to be weak.
You can't let him control you like this.
This isn't you!
It is me.
It's always been me.
He raised me to be a killer.
Now I'm gonna make him regret it.
Go help Clary.
- She needs you.
- No.
No.
No, no.
You don't have to do this.
All right?
You're not a...
Jace?
Where's Valentine?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
I saw you take the ring.
And walk into a trap?
I don't think so.
Tell me what I need to know... or you're gonna lose the other hand... one finger at a time.
You're just like your father.
Then you know how slow your death will be if you don't answer my questions.
Where's Valentine?
Okay.
Simon, it's 6:00 a.m. The sun's almost up.
No problem.
We'll go downstairs and take the tunnels out.
Come on.
Going somewhere?
Raphael.
You should have stayed put.
I'm disappointed in you.
I...
I guess it's too late to put her back in the box?
I'm afraid so.
Our alliance is finished.
The Accords may prohibit killing mundanes, but they say nothing about sunburned vampires.
Simon's betrayed us...
just as Camille did.
They deserve the same fate.
Adios.
Kill them.
Seriously, guys?
Typical vampire... always underestimating a Shadowhunter.
Adios.
I think I'd have been better off just staying in the coffin.
But you didn't.
We got you out.
Technically, I got you out.
Noted.
Now, tell us where the book is.
Patience, my dear...
Enough!
Just because we got you out doesn't mean I won't kill you right here.
There's still one more thing I require of, um...
Simon.
A Writ of Transmutation.
What the hell is that?
A document stating you asked her to turn you into a vampire.
Signed and sealed in your blood, of course.
Haven't you had enough of my blood?
Never.
And I definitely don't want the Clave to falsely accuse me of killing mundanes.
You want Simon to pardon you?
No way.
You killed Simon.
The least we could do is return the favor.
And yet...
the second I go up in smoke, so does any hope of you finding your precious book.
It's okay.
So where do we get this document, huh?
I can't imagine you have many friends left.
I know a guy.
So, Magnus, how long has it been?
One hundred?
One hundred fifty years?
One hundred and thirty-eight.
Oddly, I haven't missed you.
Of course you have, my love.
All right, you two can catch up later.
Right now, we need to find the Book of the White.
And you will, but not without payment.
You of all people should understand that.
Of course.
And what is it you require?
A clean slate.
She wants a Writ of Turning-Me-Into-A-Vampire.
And we need you to draft it.
Hmm.
I thought I was done with you.
We'll never be done with each other.
I'm gonna call for backup.
Simon, can I talk to you for a minute?
You don't have to go through with this.
If you want to go out there and stake Camille through the heart,
I will hold her down while you do it.
I don't even care about that anymore.
Nothing matters but Jocelyn.
We have to wake her up.
She loves you so much.
She was always kind of like a second mom to me.
Remember when she got me that sealed copy of Battletoads?
Yeah.
I didn't even care that she opened it.
She just wanted to watch us play.
But Simon, Camille's dangerous.
If you sign this thing, we'll just be setting her free to kill again.
No.
She's not half as bad as Valentine.
Your mom beat him once.
If Valentine has a weakness, she knows it.
Or... maybe she is it.
But... we have to at least find out.
I guess it's not just me that needs my mom.
It's all of us.
You're still upset by my dalliance with that short-lived Russian?
Upset?
No.
I gave up feeling anything for you over a century ago.
Love is fleeting.
Even more so when you're immortal.
And yet true love cannot die.
But people can.
People are more than just toys for your amusement.
Hundreds of years old and still so naive.
You wouldn't know what to do with love if you found it.
Or do you think you already have?
Angel blood.
Well, this is awkward.
Where's the book?
It's complicated.
Clearly.
I have it.
And she's graciously offered it in exchange for her freedom.
And her freedom requires a lip-lock?
We don't negotiate with prisoners.
Prisoner?
I beg to disagree.
You see, I'm your only chance at saving the world.
You need me.
You certainly have a type, don't you, Magnus?
He's cute.
Too bad it won't last.
Say that again... you won't last.
I'd say he's about 20 years from male pattern baldness.
I don't have time for this.
Where's Clary?
Alec, did you find Hodge?
Yeah, but Valentine has the Cup.
What?
We're too late.
Where's Jace?
Is he okay?
He went after Valentine by himself.
It's like he's totally lost it.
I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen.
We need to find Jace.
He's in a dark place.
We don't know what he's gonna do.
Luke is out looking for him.
Jace wants us to stay on mission.
- That means we have to find the book.
- He's right.
We have to wake up your mom.
It's our only way to stop Valentine.
Ready to sign?
Take us to the apartment, give us the book, then you can have your pardon.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Good.
- Where is he?
- He was here.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he was here!
Ah, Jonathan.
To what do I owe this surprise?
I've reconsidered your offer.
First you want to kill me, then you want to join me.
Seems a bit convenient, don't you think?
- Do you want to meet me or not?
- Yes.
But on my terms, not yours.
'Cause I've taught you better than this.
Always strike where your opponent is vulnerable.
See, fighting you directly could prove... difficult.
But your friends...
Well, your friends are a different matter.
Pick up.
Come on, pick up.
You've reached Clary's phone.
I'm not here, but you know the deal.
- Damn it.
Where are you?
- Leave one at the beep.
Clary, call me as soon as you get this.
I thought the underground parking was nice.
Wow.
You've got a lot of books.
I've got a lot of time on my hands.
Welcome home, Madame Belcourt.
- This place creeps me out.
- Yeah.
- Let's check the perimeter.
- Good idea.
If I know Camille, she'll have a trick or three up her sleeve.
I still don't get it.
Why do you have this place if you live at Hotel DuMort?
The DuMort has too many rules.
Think of it like Gracie Mansion.
It's the official residence, but it doesn't mean I have to live there.
This place gives me the freedom to indulge in certain... proclivities.
You know, the mayor has the same problem.
Ow!
Hey.
Come with me.
On the dotted line.
Thank you.
He did what you asked.
Now give us the Book of the White.
I'd love to... but I can't.
I have no idea where it is.
Dot gave it to you.
I'm sure it's here somewhere.
But if the idea was to hide it, telling me would defeat the purpose.
Dot must have put it somewhere when I wasn't looking.
So we have to search the whole apartment?
See?
That's the spirit.
Although I'd start now.
I've got four more rooms just like this one.
Good-bye, Simon.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
- Wait.
- I wish I could, my little caramel.
But don't worry... we'll see each other soon.
I hate when she does that.
Jace?
Are you okay?
- Where are you?
- At Camille's apartment, Upper East Side.
Alucard building, 13th floor.
You're in danger.
Valentine's probably already on the way.
You need to leave, now.
We are so close to finding the Book of the White.
I'm not leaving without it.
Clary, you need to leave!
You said yourself, we have to stay on mission.
You need to leave now.
I can't.
Clary.
Clary!
Damn it.
I wish my mom had left us something.
Some sort of clue.
Maybe she did.
Did she ever say anything about a book?
I don't think so.
And if she did, she erased my memory of anything to do with the Shadow World.
Well, there's got to be something.
Maybe the clue has something to do with color, you know?
White is the absence of color, so...
Or is that black?
Simon, just let me think for a second.
Clary, that's a cookbook.
I've seen this before.
Chicken cacciatore, remember?
My mom used to make it all the time.
How could I forget?
Even better the next day.
The gift that keeps on giving.
It's...
Maybe more than we realized.
Is that what I think it is?
This is it.
You did it!
We gotta go.
He's here.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
Clarissa.
So good to see you again.
- Where's your brother?
- You think I'd tell you?
You won't have to.
Stay away from her!
Simon!
Stop!
This time you're not getting away.
Finally ready to kill your own father?
You abandoned me.
I was protecting you.
You weren't ready then, but you've grown.
You've become the warrior I've trained you to be.
You trained me well.
And yet, I still have so much to teach you.
I brought you here for a reason.
Look, fight me, and watch your friends die.
See, you are strong, but they make you weak.
Let us go.
You can have the book.
We won't be able to stop you without it.
- Ah, Clarissa.
- So like your mother.
Willing to do anything for those that you love.
I'm touched, but...
the book was never part of my plan.
I want you to wake up your mother.
I know that you'll both join me eventually.
It's fated.
You ready?
If I go with you... promise me you won't hurt them.
You have my word.
This is insane.
I'm sorry, Clary.
Jace... what are you doing?
You can't be serious!
Valentine is wrong.
You're not like him.
I'm not.
You're not!
You don't know that, Clary.
You don't know that.
Let them go.
- Simon...
- Get back, get back.
Alec, I mean it.
Jace.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
If you enter a Portal not knowing where you're going, you'll be stuck in limbo forever.
At least we got Hodge, right?
Clary?
We have to find Jace.
He thinks Valentine did something to him.
Raised him to be evil, but...
But I know Jace.
He's good.
He's tough.
He can handle himself.
Besides... knowing Jace, I give it a week before Valentine's begging us to take him back.
Simon, not now.
We'll save him.
What Valentine told Jace about his friends making him weak, that was wrong.
Love makes us stronger.
You saved me from the vampires.
Without you and Jace, I wouldn't be here.
We'll save him.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
Whatever you do, don't lose hope.
I love you, Clary.
I love you, too, Simon.
I know you don't want to hear it, so I'll just say it once.
Whatever I felt for Camille, it's ancient history.
Almost literally.
Yeah, but what she said about you being immortal... she's right.
You watch the people you care about age and die.
Alexander...
I may be the High Warlock of Brooklyn, but... even I can't see the future.
They're ready.
They moved her to the Ops Center.
Good.
We need the space.
Jocelyn's spell is very powerful.
Do you really think this is gonna work?
Let us hope.
Jocelyn!
I got you.
Luke.
Mom.
Mom!
I've missed you so much.
Oh...
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about your past.
No, not now.
I have had enough for one day.
We can talk about all that later.
Right now, I just...
I just really need my mom.
It's okay.
Join me... and my son!
Pledge me your loyalty!
Together... we can preserve our race and rid the world of the demons who plague it.
You are the chosen ones.
The new breed of Shadowhunters!
- We need blood.
- So I've heard.
Human blood.
Everything's out of control.
We were fools to believe Valentine was dead.
Previously on Shadowhunters...
My sister wants you to be her defense attorney.
For the right price.
- Name it.
- You.
Clary, if you don't help us, no one survives.
Do you understand?
Mom, please, wake up.
- You're out of order.
- This whole thing is out of order.
I am your father, Clary.
And Jace's.
- They're brother and sister.
- That means they can't...
You'll be lonely all your life.
Neither of you deserve it.
And I don't either.
Bring the flowers out to the wedding tent.
Put the lilies up on the dais, and lay the rose petals at the entrance.
Isabelle, which color do you like better?
It's for the curtains adorning the wedding tent.
Hmm.
The cobalt blue.
It's elegant, masculine... very Alec.
I'll put the cobalt blue out right away.
How are we supposed to get any work done with all this going on?
We haven't had a wedding here in years.
- People are allowed to be excited.
- We need to focus.
Have you narrowed down the list of warlocks more powerful than Magnus Bane?
I've got it down to 20.
But it's gonna be hard to figure out which one cast that spell on Jocelyn.
I don't care how tough it is, we've gotta find him.
Back at Renwick's, I let Valentine go.
I won't make that mistake again.
We gotta wake up Jocelyn, in case she heard anything about his plan.
Have you spoken to Alec?
He's probably busy, what with wedding plans and all.
And I don't need to talk to anyone.
Let's just stick to the mission, okay?
She looks so peaceful now.
I just wish I knew how to reach her.
She's gonna be fine.
I'm sorry, Clary.
We should have told you everything before this got...
Luke, we can hash all that out when we wake Mom up.
The important thing now is that we have her back.
I'm looking for Lydia.
Have you seen her?
- I don't mean to interrupt your...
- No, stay for a minute.
I gotta get back to the station.
- Call me if anything changes?
- Yeah.
So, how is she?
The same, I guess.
Alec, I know you and I don't always see eye to eye on things...
Actually, we never see eye to eye on anything, but I do want to thank you for everything you've done to get my mom back.
Actually I...
I should thank you.
I don't know what would have happened to Isabelle after the trial if you hadn't returned the Cup.
You saved my sister, so thank you.
Yeah, my whole world turned upside down, but, um, you and I thanking each other that's... that's too much.
Yeah.
Magnus needs to speak with me.
He might have some information about how to wake your mother up or... stop Valentine.
It's important.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Hello...
Magnus?
You said you needed to talk to me.
Nice to see you, Alec.
I wasn't sure if you'd come.
You know how I hate to drink alone.
I didn't come here to drink.
Do you have any information...
On the warlock who cast a spell on Jocelyn?
I'm looking into it.
But... we never really finished our conversation after Izzy's trial.
About your wedding?
There's no conversation to be had.
I'm getting married.
You and I, we understand marriage very differently.
I'm a Shadowhunter.
This is about family, and tradition, honor...
Honor?
Where's the honor in living a lie?
What are you talking about?
What about love?
Even Shadowhunters fall in love, Alec.
Just tell me you're in love with Lydia, and I'll stop.
I don't know.
Why do you keep pushing?
You're confusing me.
Confusion is part of it.
That's how you find out if something's there.
Emotions are never black and white.
They're more like symptoms.
You lose your breath every time they enter a room.
Your heart beats faster when they walk by.
Your skin tingles when they stand close enough to feel their breath.
I know you feel what I feel, Alec.
You don't have any clue what I feel... so back off.
This is all just a game to you, isn't it?
You flirt, you laugh, you use magic, but at the end of the day, what do you risk?
Even if I did feel something for you... you want me to give up my life for you?
I have to do what's right for me.
I could lose my family, my career, everything!
You just don't get it.
You have a choice to make.
I will not ask again.
Hey, Clary.
What's goin' on?
I just, uh, needed to hear your voice.
Are you okay?
You sound upset.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just... things are kind of weird with Jace right now, but
- we'll work it out.
- So how's your mom?
I mean, I can't believe you actually rescued her.
We still have to wake her up, but at least she's away from Valentine.
When can I see her?
How about tomorrow night?
She's here at the infirmary.
Plus, it's Alec's wedding, so...
I'd love if you'd come as my date.
Really?
I...
See, I just assumed you'd want to go with Jace.
That's, uh... not really in the cards right now.
Besides, you are the person I'm closest to in the world.
- Please come.
- I'd love to.
Um...
But I might be a little bit late, you know, with the sun and all.
You are the best.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Morning.
Morning.
You just come from training?
Yeah.
I'm, uh, workin' on my right hook.
Good.
That's a good punch.
Yeah.
I'm, uh, I'm workin' on it.
While this conversation is no doubt scintillating, remind me why we couldn't do this at my place?
- At least there we'd have cocktails.
- It's 9:00 in the morning.
Oh, it's happy hour somewhere, my dear.
We invited you here, Magnus, because Hodge can't leave the Institute.
He's an important part of this mission.
Well, then, where is our tardy little tutor?
There are certain individuals that I'd like to avoid,
- so let's make this quick.
- Pardon the delay, Magnus.
I was following up on a lead.
Now, we've narrowed down our list of warlocks to these three.
Why is Ragnor Fell up there?
He's not more powerful than I am.
Well, some would disagree.
He is older than you.
- Certainly not wiser.
- Who is Ragnor Fell?
The former High Warlock of London.
And one of my oldest friends.
Very prickly, likes to keep to himself.
Okay, look.
We just need to figure out which one of these warlocks had enough access to Jocelyn that they could create the potion for her without anyone discovering what they'd done.
By the early '90s, Ragnor was a professor at the Shadowhunter Academy in Idris.
Isn't that when my mother lived there?
Could he have made the potion for her?
The little bugger!
That's why he hasn't responded to my fire message.
Ever since Valentine began hunting warlocks,
Ragnor's been holed up in his secret country house just outside of London.
For all I know, Ragnor suspected my fire message was a ploy by Valentine to lure him out of hiding.
We'll have to confront him face-to-face.
- You're going on this mission?
- Of course!
I'm the only one Ragnor trusts.
Besides, I've played my last hand here.
Even I know when to fold.
Magnus, I didn't know you were here.
That was the point.
We're just on our way to greet a few representatives of the Clave who arrived early for tomorrow's wedding.
How long are you staying?
What's going on here?
Nobody told me about a meeting.
Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom.
We're just bringing him back to the Institute.
How can I help?
We're just recovering a warlock, Alec.
We got this covered.
Besides, you have emissaries from the Clave to meet.
You don't want to tarnish your family's perfectly-crafted image now, do you?
Again, lovely seeing you, Magnus.
Get ready.
We leave in an hour.
Jace.
Jace, slow down.
We need to talk about this.
Talk about what?
We're good, okay?
No, we're not.
At least...
I'm not.
We need to talk about what Valentine said about us.
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
It happened.
I feel weird right now.
I get it.
I feel the same way, okay?
But...
Look, we didn't know, all right?
It's not our fault.
I can't do this right now.
I'm sorry.
Now that the Clave has control of the Mortal Cup, thanks to your lovely bride to be,
Mom and Dad can come home now.
They arrive tonight.
I heard.
Max is staying with his tutors in Idris.
It's safer there.
Now with all the dignitaries arriving for the wedding,
Mom must be beside herself.
This wedding is becoming more of a headache than I had planned.
Alec, you don't have to go through with this if you don't want to.
It's what I want.
- Okay.
- Okay?
No big argument from you?
You stood by me through my trial, and now I'm standing by you, big brother.
And...
I'm throwing you a bachelor party.
- A what?
- A bachelor party.
I don't need a bachelor party.
No one needs a bachelor party, but I'm throwing you one anyways.
Actually, Jace should be the one throwing it, but considering everything he must be going through with Clary...
I don't wanna ask him to do anything.
- You know what I mean?
- I do.
Sisters can really drive you nuts sometimes.
Ragnor's house is just across these fields.
Let's make this quick.
We'll talk to Ragnor, then Portal him back to the Institute before anyone knows we're gone.
So... brother and sister, huh?
I don't wanna talk about it.
What, so we're just gonna be work buddies now?
All about the mission, and totally ignore
- the huge bomb that just dropped on us.
- Yeah, sounds like a plan.
What do you want me to say, Clary?
That I was attracted to my sister?
Point of fact, brother and sisters are often attracted to each other.
I once knew this one couple in ancient Egypt...
Magnus, not helping.
Maybe this will all make sense when we wake up Jocelyn.
- Since she is Jace's mother as well, perhaps...
- Don't say that again.
Maryse is my mother.
At best, Jocelyn is the woman who abandoned me.
Hey, that is not true.
My mother would never abandon her son.
She thought you were dead.
Or maybe she just didn't want me.
- You don't know her, Jace.
- That's right, Clary, I don't.
Do you?
I'm sorry I asked!
I came with you to escape my relationship drama, not get a front row seat to yours.
- What was that?
- Nice try, Jace.
You're not getting out of this conversation that easily.
Look out!
Ragnor put up wards to protect his lair.
Why is the fire green?
It's a wall of fire that only the pure of heart and intention can pass through.
Are you ready?
Jace?
Magnus?
Where are you?
Ragnor Fell.
Ragnor?
Ragnor?
Hello?
Is anybody home?
I need your help.
Ragnor, I know you're here.
I just need to find my friends.
Nice try, Ragnor.
Well done...
Clary Fairchild.
I've been expecting you.
You have Jocelyn's talent, I see.
Only a true artist would notice the subtle changes in my eyes.
Yes, I know.
I need to work on not moving my eyes, you don't need to remind me.
You knew my mom?
So you made the potion that put her to sleep?
At her request, yes.
And I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me looking for the antidote.
Please, sit.
My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane.
They were with me, but I lost them in the fire.
Let me do this my way!
Your friends, are they true?
Magnus said he's known you for centuries.
He sent you a fire message.
This is not an act.
It is not an act!
It is essential.
Okay, what is your deal?
My friends are missing and if you can't help me,
- I'll find someone who can.
- What is it worth to you?
You find my friends and wake my mother...
- I'll give you anything.
- That's what I wanted to hear.
Honestly, Ragnor, was that nonsense necessary?
Of course.
She offered me anything.
You were only up to a timeshare of your flat in Paris.
Yawn.
All right, enough with the warlock games.
Can you really wake my mother?
Not without the Book of the White.
What is the Book of the White?
It's an ancient book of warlock magic containing spells more powerful than... most warlocks could ever imagine.
I possessed the book when your mother came to me, and I used its contents to create the potion.
Regrettably, I no longer have the book.
I asked Jocelyn to hide it that Valentine might never find it.
Ragnor, please, I have to get my mom back.
Is there any way to get the Book of the White?
Possibly.
I may have something that can help us.
Won't be but a moment.
What do we do if he can't find the book?
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
It's a bit drab, isn't it?
Ragnor!
Shax demon.
Creature took me... by surprise.
How could a Shax demon get past Ragnor's wards?
It must have followed us.
Jumped through when the fire wall reset.
Be still, my little dear cabbage.
Your wounds are deep.
Hold on, please.
No, no, no.
For centuries, this man knew me better than anyone.
Magnus, I'm so sorry.
We have to leave, now.
We can't.
Not until we find whatever it is Ragnor said could help us locate the Book of the White.
It's too dangerous.
If one Shax demon found us,
- you can bet there are more on the way.
- We have to try!
We don't have time to scour through mountains of Ragnor's stuff.
Get back to the Institute.
I'll transport everything back to my place, and find what you need.
Now, leave me to take care of my friend.
- Magnus, I am...
- Go!
Jace, you're coming to Alec's bachelor party, right?
No.
He doesn't want me there, and I'm swamped.
You two seriously haven't worked things out yet?
There's nothing to work out.
If he wants to talk, we'll talk.
He's your parabatai.
We have more important things going on than a bachelor party.
Come with me.
We have a mole in the Institute.
We were attacked by a Shax demon when we went to see Ragnor Fell.
The attack couldn't have been coincidence.
Valentine must have been tracking us.
You don't think someone from the Institute told Valentine where you were going.
There's no other explanation.
No one here would betray us like that.
This is our family.
Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom.
We're bringing him back to the Institute.
Not everyone's family yet.
- I swear, if Lydia is the leak, I'm gonna...
- Slow down.
We don't know if she did anything yet.
And wrongfully accusing someone of a crime is dangerous.
Trust me, I've been through it.
Lydia was right there when we were talking about Ragnor Fell.
If she's not gonna admit what she did, I'm gonna make her admit it.
Jace, stop.
You are too worked up to talk to anyone right now.
Especially not an important envoy from the Clave.
Let me talk to Lydia.
If you accuse Alec's fiancée of treason, you will ruin whatever relationship you have left with him.
Clary's right, Jace.
If Lydia did this, she might not be so defensive with Clary.
She might let her guard down.
- Slip up.
- Fine.
But I wanna know everything she says.
It's perfect.
I love it.
I'm so glad.
Let me know if you need anything else.
- Your dress is stunning.
- Thank you.
I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield.
I think that's pretty normal.
Lydia, I need to talk to you about something.
What is it?
Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.
It killed Ragnor Fell.
By the Angel...
Only a few people here at the Institute even knew we were going on the mission.
You overheard us this morning.
Then we were attacked.
If I was working for Valentine, don't you think I would have already given him the Mortal Cup?
I don't believe this.
Fellow Shadowhunters accusing me of high treason.
- Lydia, I'm not accusing you of anything.
- Of course you are.
Unless you have hard evidence to back your claims,
I believe this conversation is over.
Fine, but know this.
These people have become like family to me... and I protect my family.
I care about them too.
Why else would I be marrying Alec?
How well do you actually know him?
You're talking about Alec's feelings for Magnus?
- I'm not blind.
- If... if you're not in love with Alec, then why are you going through with this marriage?
Alec's love for his family and his desire to restore the Lightwood name has touched me in ways that I haven't felt in a very long time.
Alec is a man of honor... and I truly care about him.
But what about Alec's happiness?
Shadowhunters know that our duty to our family supersedes our personal desires.
Look, I know that you're still new to this world and our traditions may seem foreign to you,
- but I...
- Yeah, more like ice cold.
Alec should not have to give up who he is, or at least the chance to figure it out, just to please his family.
But Alec proposed to me.
This is what he wants.
How do I trust you?
You're Valentine's daughter... and I learned to trust you.
Nice.
Trim fit.
- It'll make it look like you work out.
- Isabelle.
Is... is Clary okay?
She's fine.
I just need your advice on something.
First time for everything, huh?
You can go now, Stan.
What's up?
It's about Alec's bachelor party.
When you were a mundane, you went to one, right?
Well, I'm only 18, and I'm a vampire now, so...
But...
I know a thing or two.
Simon... what makes a bachelor party... a bachelor party?
Well, there is a certain bridge and tunnel crowd that would say the answer to that is strippers.
But, you know, there's no one right way to throw a bachelor party.
It... depends on who's there.
Like... they're really about best friends coming together and assuring each other that they're always gonna be best friends.
Even if one of them gets married.
So it's about solidifying the bonds with the people that are closest to you?
That, and a ton of drinking.
You have both of those, and your bachelor party will be a success.
How I loathe that photograph.
I must remember, chin down, eyes up.
Otherwise, I look like a squinty toad.
You're here.
You didn't think you'd be rid of me that easily, did you?
Oh, my dear friend,
I will always be here for you.
Now, please, put away that horrid photograph.
It commemorates a night I'd rather forget.
Oh, how I had to comfort you.
How I loved her.
I prayed she would love me the same, but she just laughed.
To Camille, immortals aren't supposed to feel true love.
She was so cynical.
Camille broke my heart.
You let her break your heart, my friend.
You're immortal... but she killed you.
Ready?
A couple more steps.
We're almost there!
All right, Izzy...
You trust me, don't you?
No, not really.
And I told you, I don't need a bachelor party.
You need this one.
Now, count to five, and take your blindfold off.
Really, Izzy?
Seriously?
Izzy said you wanted to talk.
I don't know what she thought I wanted to say.
Great.
I guess I'll go.
I've got work to do anyway.
Damn it, Izzy.
You know what?
She's right.
We do need to talk.
Okay.
Well, it's my bachelor party, so you go first.
I don't know how things got so messed up between us.
But I do know my life has been a lot harder not having you to talk to.
Mine, too.
I know it seems like I've been making a lot of crazy choices lately.
And I know you think that I was only thinking about myself... and Clary, and I wasn't thinking about the consequences to anyone else.
All I can say is, I've been going through a lot.
But I only ever did what I thought was right, Alec.
But I never wanted to hurt you.
I'm sorry.
I know.
You know, we just...
- got caught in all this drama.
- Yeah.
I mean... you're getting married tomorrow.
And Clary's your sister.
You know, what's up with that?
Hell.
Yeah, uh, don't even get me started on that.
I kissed her.
Mmm.
It's worse, I wanted her.
I was falling in love.
I must be sick or something.
I don't know.
No.
Nah.
You're not sick.
Situation's just...
It's confusing.
And trust me, I know.
You know, it's like, you have this plan for your life... right, and you know what you need to do and what your responsibilities are.
And you think, you know,
"If you follow the rules, everything's gonna be fine."
Then somebody comes along, and... pushes you off that path.
You just...
Hey...
I get it.
The point is, we're Shadowhunters.
Emotions get in the way.
And if you get knocked off the path, you have to focus... and find your way back.
I mean, you still have to be true to yourself.
I am.
I'm fulfilling my duty.
Look, would you be my suggenes and give me away tomorrow?
Alec, if this is what you really want...
I'd be honored.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
Me, too.
I wouldn't describe that as an instrument of music.
An instrument of torture, perhaps.
- Oh, you never liked the charango.
- No, I did not.
And I pray you don't play it.
Death has already given me enough of a headache.
Do you remember Imasu?
He played this so beautifully.
I'm surprised that lasted as long as it did.
He was always so much better looking than you.
I don't understand why you didn't go after the boy.
I'm certain, with very little effort, you could have won him back.
No.
Imasu wanted more than I can give.
Maybe Camille was right.
I am immortal.
I can party and have fun to my heart's content without the anchors of love around my feet.
You are not Camille.
And though I know you won't believe me, someday someone will come along who will tear down those walls you've built around your heart.
And when that love comes back to you, you must do everything in your power to fight for it.
Going somewhere?
Even in death... you give the best advice.
Be nice if you took it more than once every 300 years.
I...
When you first proposed to Lydia, I'll admit, I was wary.
But now... you've made me so proud.
All right, you're ready for this?
- As ready as I'll ever be.
- Good.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Wouldn't be anywhere else.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.
- Did I miss anything?
I left right at sunset.
- No, you're right on time.
- Cool.
- Simon, you look incredible.
Thanks.
I borrowed one of Raphael's suits.
Embracing the new me.
- So, how's your mom?
- She's good.
Uh, Luke's with her right now, watching over her.
Attention.
The ceremony is about to commence.
Wow.
It is time for Alec Lightwood and Lydia Branwell to mark each other with the Wedded Union rune.
A rune on the hand, a rune on the heart, a union is born.
What's that warlock doing here?
Izzy...
- did Alec invite Magnus?
- I did.
But I didn't think he'd show.
Magnus, leave this wedding now.
Maryse, this is between me and your son.
I'll leave if he asks me to.
Are you gonna be okay, buddy?
Alec?
Hey.
I...
I can't breathe.
I know.
It's okay.
I can't do this.
I thought we were doing the right thing, but... this isn't it.
You don't have to explain.
- Lydia, I'm sorry.
- Hey... you deserve to be happy.
Okay?
I'll be fine.
- Alec, what are you doing?
- Enough.
♪ 'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts ♪
- You never cease to amaze me, Alec.
- Yeah...
What did I just do?
Alec, I am so proud of you.
Guys, that was incredible.
It was like watching the live version of The Graduate.
You know, the Dustin Hoffman movie?
The amazing one?
You were Ben.
Elaine!
And you were Elaine.
I mean, a... a taller, masculine, handsome version of her.
But at the altar, though, you were like...
Ben!
And then... and then now, you're both sitting on the bus at the end of the movie, both totally stoked, but wondering, like...
"What're we gonna do now?"
You know?
Who invited the vampire?
Seriously?
Hey.
What you just did for Alec...
- I, um...
- It was the right thing to do.
So what are you gonna do now?
Head back to Idris.
Dive into work.
There's no place for me here.
There's always gonna be a place for you here.
Give Alec and Magnus my best.
Is Lydia gonna be okay?
She'll be all right.
Look, Clary...
Listen, I just need to say that... you were right.
Seeing what Alec just did,
I realized I can't shut you out.
I just don't know what to do with all this.
Much as this will shock Alec, my visit tonight wasn't all for him.
We need to speak privately.
I pulled every item of magical importance from Ragnor's belongings.
But I can't determine which will lead to the Book of the White.
Wait, this bookmark.
I've seen it before.
In the alternate dimension you showed me a book of spells, and this was in it.
It must have been the Book of the White.
If that's the case, we can use the bookmark to track the owner of the book.
Okay.
Warlock tracking is stronger.
Let me out of here!
Well, there's good news and bad news.
The good news is I know the owner.
The bad?
- It's Camille.
- Camille?
Looks like Raphael has her locked up in the basement of the Hotel DuMort.
Well, after I punched her, there's no way she'll help me.
She won't have a choice.
Trust me.
Why'd you ask me up here, Clary?
I needed you to see this.
What is all that?
Luke told me that my mother had a son.
Jonathan Christopher.
- What's that?
- It's my name.
"JC."
Jace.
Short for Jonathan Christopher.
Jace, I know all of this is impossible to believe, but... our mother never abandoned you.
She thought you were dead.
This is all she had left, and she... she carried you with her every single day.
Is all this really mine?
I don't know who I am anymore.
There's darkness in me.
It's always been there.
And now I...
When we rescued Jocelyn... and I let Valentine go...
I was tempted to go with him.
He's my father.
Maybe that's where I belong.
Jace...
I know you're a good man.
I don't know how, but we are going to make sense of all this.
I promise.
I'm so glad we got away from that crowd and all those people.
So intense.
I have to hand it to you, Alexander... you certainly know how to make a statement.
What have you done, Alec?
To us, this family?
- This isn't about you.
- Of course it is.
You are either being selfish or naive.
This wedding was your plan from the start.
And now you have humiliated us in front of the most respected members of the Clave.
I don't even recognize you anymore.
I'm the same person I've always been.
Now everything's just out in the open.
And all for a Downworlder.
Just give her time.
And you?
I don't really understand this.
But I suppose our world is changing.
How long has this been going on?
Are you two in love?
Love?
What?
No.
No, it's... it's, uh, it's sort of a different...
It's not...
It's all very new.
Right.
I better go check on Mom.
You know what I just realized?
We still haven't gone on our date yet.
Yeah, you're right.
You wanna...
I don't know, get a drink sometime?
I would love that.
Great.
Looks like we missed the wedding of the year.
It's all right.
You and I will be able to share our love openly one day.
How is she?
She's asleep... but she's home.
You okay, Hodge?
Yeah.
You should get some rest.
You've been so vigilant.
Why don't you let me watch over her.
Thank you, my friend.
Of course.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
You have the Cup.
Help me break my Punishment rune... and I will bring it to you.
A deal is a deal.
Previously on "Royal Pains"...
Help!
Someone please help my brother.
Hang in there, Ian.
I promise you'll get your foot back in a sec.
I'd like to speak to your folks anyway.
They're not around, but, uh, do you have, like, a card or something?
I've actually been in a lot of pain since the bike accident.
It looks like pancreatitis, so I'll need to reexamine you at some point.
And I'd like to talk to your aunt so that she knows what's going...
Yeah, that's fine.
(UPBEAT MUSIC)
All right, check with the ER in Riverhead then.
Just get back to me, ASAP though, okay?
All right, bye. (SIGHS)
Really?
Two phones?
You know you're running a hospital, not a stock exchange, right?
One for hospital business development, one for staffing.
And one for HankMed.
This one usually stays in the bag though 'cause three phones would look ridiculous.
Plus, you pretty much got the day-to-day handled over there anyway.
Well, not today.
The bookkeeper dropped off these spreadsheets.
I need you to decipher them, please.
(SIGHS)
Looks like we're low on retainers.
Oh, my God.
What, business development emergency?
No.
Emergency room emergency.
Most of the physicians have come down with this awful summer cold right when the head of ER is on vacation, so it's just causing a whole bunch of...
Oh, my God!
Now Dr. Roseman can't make it back till later today.
I gotta go.
I gotta find someone to cover the ER.
I could do it.
You?
Yeah, I could cover the shift.
It took the threat of an international incident to make you an attending, and that was just on paper.
You're House Call Hank, not Hospital Hank.
For you, I can make an exception.
I'll even give you a family discount.
♪ ♪
- Morning, Jeremiah.
- Yes, it is.
Any chance you can help me with appointments?
It's just you and me today.
Of course, I've been working on these data tables for hours.
I could use a break.
What?
You just called seeing patients a break.
You've come a long way since you were isolating yourself in here.
Why is it just the two of us today?
- What do we got?
- Male, 30s.
Syncope.
Full-thickness forehead laceration.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Clear the way.
Welcome to the ER, Dr. Lawson.
But we usually just let the EMTs bring them in.
Oh, okay.
What's your name?
- Barry.
- Hi, Barry, I'm Hank.
Let's take a look at this.
When is the doctor getting here?
I am the doctor.
Oh, uh, call me Dr. Lawson.
So what happened?
I was chopping vegetables for a salad.
This new diet is more work than it's worth.
Suddenly I got dizzy.
Next thing I knew, I was on the floor bleeding.
I must have hit the counter on the way down.
Huh.
Do you have a history of heart disease?
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.
Okay, you said you're on a new diet.
Do you eat a lot of salad?
I do now.
I just went vegetarian.
Dr. Lawson, should I call plastics?
No, I can stitch it myself.
I need a 4.0 Vicryl, 6.0 nylon.
My ER is short on physicians.
You need to delegate.
Uh, all right, call plastics.
But make sure Barry's hematocrit is over 30.
Let me know immediately if it's not.
Got it.
(SIGHS)
Hi, Hank.
Jill.
(UPBEAT MUSIC)
I can't believe it!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Well, I was gonna call you, but then I saw your name on the ER board, and I just...
I thought it'd be more fun to surprise you.
Mission accomplished.
Oh, Hank, sorry.
This is Dr. deGroot.
Oh, please, call me Hans.
Hans, nice to meet you.
So what are you doing here?
Well, the foundation had a fundraiser in the city, and they flew us in at the last minute.
And, well, ever since they put a picture of Hans and me on the homepage, we've accidentally become the face of the clinic.
Ah.
And who wouldn't want to open up their checkbook after seeing a photo of this beautiful woman vaccinating a baby?
Okay, look, I'm pretty sure that it's the shirtless shot of you in the rain that tends to seal the deal.
- Huh.
- I gave my shirt to that boy as a makeshift sling.
It was medically necessary.
- Okay.
- Huh.
Hey, so, uh, cancel your plans tonight.
I'm trying to get everyone together for a HankMed family reunion before we head off on the red-eye.
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Good.
And if it's not too much to ask,
I wondered if you could help me with some antibiotics for the trip back.
I have a sore throat.
Probably strep.
Been getting it a lot.
Okay, let me take a look.
(THERMOMETER BEEPING)
Yeah, you do have a low-grade temp... 99.9.
- Any other symptoms?
- Just a sore throat.
Okay, I'm just gonna grab a quick culture.
Open up, please.
Great.
Wow.
I never thought I would see Hank Lawson back in the ER.
What brought you in from the cold?
Ah, it's just for today.
Long story.
- I'll tell you tonight.
- Okay.
- Jill?
Oh, my gosh!
- Hey!
Aww, my favorite ER taskmaster... hi!
Wow.
We need to catch up.
And, Dr. Lawson, we've got an ingrown toenail with paronychia.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Um, here is a script for penicillin, and I will let you know the results of the strep test.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
So good to see you.
So yeah, I'll see you tonight, okay?
All right, great.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
Nice to meet you, Hans.
Bye.
Dr. Lawson?
- Dr. Lawson!
- Yes, right.
Coming.
Hello, Miss Green?
I'm Dr. Sacani from HankMed.
Oh, hi.
Sorry, I got buried in my work, and I forgot you were coming.
That's all right.
I'm familiar with the experience of being lost in one's work.
What can I do for you?
Uh, I've been feeling... well, it's my head, and I...
I just feel...
Is your headache sharp or a dull pain?
Uh, dull at the temples.
Just on and off for a few weeks.
What else?
You just feeling sort of, um, achy, tired, sore, weak?
Weak... that's it.
And my wrist started hurting this morning.
Okay, um, we'll start with an exam.
I'll get some vitals.
Dr. Sacani?
Uh, those bottles have scrolls in them, like the Message Tree from "The Chronicles of Zall."
Are you a C.G. Leviathan fan?
Well, I...
You're obviously familiar with the books.
Uh, very.
There's a book festival in town.
I was thinking of going.
They're gonna have a, uh, a panel on whether Jazwick is really dead.
Sacerdas saw his death in a vision, but the visions have been changeable in the past.
I saw that they were doing that panel.
Are you going?
I-I considered it, but, uh...
It's... crowds make me nervous.
Oh, me too.
But I was hoping I could find out whether Leviathan has finished writing the new installment.
He is as mysterious as his next book.
Even the Internet doesn't know who he really is.
Oh, um, your blood pressure is a bit high, so we should, uh, keep an eye on that.
In the meantime, I'd like to examine your wrist, and I'll draw some blood to check for thyroid irregularities or nutritional deficiencies.
Uh, Ms. Green, what is your first name?
Cindy.
Cin...
Wait... oh.
Cindy Green.
C.G.
You're C.G. Leviathan?
Hey, Lena from the bike crash, right?
- Yeah.
- How's your brother's foot?
He's great.
Back to bouncing off the walls.
Well, you're not.
So what's going on?
I keep throwing up.
Apparently, taco trucks that are Instagram famous can still give you food poisoning.
Okay, well, let's make sure it's not something worse than bad tacos.
Lie back, please.
Does that hurt?
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.
No, I just...
I think that it's just that I'm sore from all the throwing up.
Right, um, Margaret?
We need a CBC, BMP, UPREG, and then start her on Zofran and IV fluids.
- Doctor?
- Hey, um... you're in good hands with Nurse Margaret here.
I'll come back soon to check up on you.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Did you get an executive paper cut from all that business developing?
Uh, no, I'm here 'cause, uh, your department's backed up.
Connecting with patients makes you an amazing concierge doctor, but you can't run the ER like HankMed.
So just... just treat them and move on, okay?
Wait, did you seriously just come down here to tell me to move the meat?
No, I came down here to tell you to move the patients.
Huh.
Like that guy with the cut on his forehead.
- Barry?
- Yes, Barry.
You know you spent 22% more time with him than our average for lacerations?
22%... what happened during that 22%?
Did you learn all his hopes and dreams?
No, I learned that he's on a new vegetarian diet, which caused anemia.
That's why he fainted.
That's what I learned.
- Clear the way!
Bed right here!
- Male, late 40s.
He was found unconscious in his office.
He has no pulse and is not responding to chest compressions.
Okay, thank you.
Let's get him on the bed.
On three... one, two, three.
Okay.
What's this?
Who wears a fanny pack with a suit?
This is not the time.
It's not a fanny pack.
It's a battery.
It's connected to something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop.
He has a Left Ventricular Assist Device in his heart.
Compressions could kill him.
Um, call the cardiothoracic surgeon.
Tell her to prep the OR.
The wire from the battery pack to his pump has been cut.
The pump was the only thing perfusing his body.
Yeah, we don't have time to replace it.
Okay, um, get me a scalpel, electrical tape, a bunch of hemostats, and some cardboard.
We're gonna reconnect the battery.
Thank you.
His SpO2 is below 80.
Ground it.

I just stumbled into my desk.
Isn't an X-ray a bit overkill?
No, it's an appropriate diagnostic tool given the amount of swelling and tenderness in your wrist.
I got that.
(SIGHS)
It is fractured, which is surprising, given the low-impact nature of your injury.
Um, I'll splint the wrist for now, and we can put the cast on when the swelling subsides.
It broke so easily.
I...
I know I don't get out much, but I'm not frail.
We'll do some bone density tests to see if there's something else going on.
And your wrist will heal soon, so don't worry.
You'll be typing again in no time.
Wait, I won't be able to type?
How much time is "no time"?
Well, as you yourself wrote,
"The Great Sea can be crossed quickly, but better to cross it safely."
You're worried because you're on a deadline?
Book six is due to my editor next month.
The fans are waiting.
Yes, we are.
What brought you to my books?
Um, I have trouble picking up on unarticulated emotions sometimes, and my therapist recommended your fiction as an intermediary step 'cause the characters often tell you exactly what they're feeling.
But you read me though, just now.
You knew why I was worried.
I must be making progress.
I don't mean to brag.
I have trouble relating to people sometimes too.
They can be so loud and fast.
Everyone coming at you, wanting answers.
That's why I love writing.
My characters quiet down when I tell them to.
- I could type.
- What?
You could dictate, and I could type.
According to Mavis Beacon,
I'm above average in both speed and accuracy.
You should know,
I am bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, not to divulge any secrets I may learn about Zall.
Is this you being nice or you wanting to know what happens in book six?
Um, both.
So what else is new?
- I miss caffeine.
- (LAUGHS)
Well, on the plus side, you are the most beautiful pregnant woman ever.
(LAUGHS) Can you please come over every morning and tell me that when I can't fit into anything?
Deal.
In a few weeks, I don't know where you're gonna be coming to.
Still no word from Johns Hopkins?
Nope, nothing yet.
Well, be patient.
You'll end up where you're supposed to be.
What matters is that you're taking a leave.
Like you did.
Yeah, remember how terrified I was?
But once I realized it was my dream, there was no turning back.
Hey...
I am so proud of you.
Sometimes I think I'm crazy for taking this on, Jill.
The Divya Katdare I know can handle it all.
- Hey!
- BOTH:
Hey.
Here you go.
Extra hot, extra shot.
- You remembered.
- I did.
So how's it going in the ER?
Yeah, word is you pulled off this miraculous save with cardboard and duct tape?
Oh, uh, actually, it was electrical tape.
Oh.
You do know the point of an ER is that they have all the equipment that you need that you don't need to build some crazy contraption like you do at HankMed?
I had to rewire an LVAD on the fly.
I mean, they don't exactly have a tool for that lying around.
Some things don't change.
It is so good to all be together again.
You sure you can't stay awhile?
I really wish I could, but we've got so much going on right now.
The foundation wants to send me to some of their other clinics to introduce our new health care training initiative.
Jill is being modest.
She designed the program herself, and because it's been so successful, they wanna put it in clinics all over the world.
Oh, my God.
That sounds incredible.
Thank you.
(RATTLING)
Ugh, I'm all set for the trip back.
First-world medicine is amazing.
(LAUGHS)
Hans, I'm so glad to finally meet you on this trip.
I've heard so much about you.
You have?
Well, yeah, hello!
The monsoon story?
- The monsoon story.
- Oh, right, right, right.
When there was a puddle so big outside Jill's bungalow that people were actually fishing in it.
Yeah, no.
The other monsoon story.
When the village flooded and Hans improvised a rope bridge across the ravine.
He even saved the goat.
Ah.
I just knew the right knots to tie.
At last, my scouting days in Naaldenveld gave me something besides chigger bites.
(LAUGHS)
And what did the grateful villagers call you?
Dr. Big One. (LAUGHTER)
- Dr. Big One?
- Mm.
His surname, deGroot, translates that way.
Oh, how nice for you.
Mine means "son of Lawrence." - (CHUCKLES)
Hey, isn't that Lena Crawford?
Is her pancreatitis acting up?
Pancreatitis?
She didn't mention that.
Excuse us a moment.
- Hey, Lena.
- You okay?
Why didn't you tell me about your pancreatitis?
Because I'm better now.
That was, like, forever ago.
Well, you may not be completely better.
Your vomiting could be caused by pancreatic pseudocysts.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry, I really need to get going.
No, you really need to stay here.
If you have pseudocysts, we have to drain them.
Otherwise they could rupture.
Please, come back with us.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Evan, thank you for sending so many supplies to the clinic.
Oh, of course.
Yeah, Hamptons Heritage is always happy to do what we can for the, uh, people of...
- Sierra Leone.
- Sierra Leone.
That's right, and all nations, really.
That's why I paused just then.
I was gonna list them all.
Uh, have you guys seen Hank yet?
Yeah, uh, in the ER, of all places.
Mm-hmm.
And he helped me out with a much needed prescription.
Oh, I hope everything's okay.
Yeah, just running a slight fever.
And you were just in Sierra Leone?
Right this way, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, nice and easy.
MAN OVER PA SYSTEM:
Code quarantine, ER.
Code 529.

- Quarantine.
Down the hall to the right or left.
Keep calm.
Look the other way.
All right, this is clear.
Guys, guys, what's happening?
I forgot about first-world bureaucracy.
We're activating quarantine protocol.
If a patient possibly has Ebola...
Ebola?
He has strep.
He has a fever and was just in Sierra Leone.
Okay, okay.
Help me out here.
Was Hans in an area where there have been reported cases of Ebola?
(EXHALES)
There have been no recent cases.
Right, and he's showing no other symptoms.
If a patient presents with a fever and has just visited an outbreak region,
I have to quarantine, okay, until we get the results of a blood test.
Ev, you're overreacting.
I'm following protocol.
Let's go, guys.

This is not a crisis.
Sanitize your hands thoroughly.
There's a chart on the wall.
Yeah, don't need a chart.
No, that's not true.
We're just covering our bases.
That's right.
I've notified the DOHMH.
Now we're just waiting for the LRN to finish EVD testing.
And, uh... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Make sure to let the sanitizer dry completely before putting the gloves on."
Yeah, why don't I take over the checklist?
- No, it's...
- I know protocol.

Thank you.
- Nitrile gloves.
- Nitrile gloves.
Well, no comment.
No, sorry, bye.
Evan R. Lawson.
Yes, thank you for calling back.
Uh-huh, yes, this is definitely a crisis.
We need CDC backup, ASAP.
You know, Jill, I'm the Ebola lead here.
I need to ask if you traveled to Sierra Leone.
No.
Hans went alone.
Okay, disposable gown.
(CLEARS THROAT)
What about your contact with Hans?
I thought you weren't worried about Ebola.
I'm not, but I'm worried about you.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hans came straight from Sierra Leone, and we met up at the fundraiser, but he left early because he had a sore throat.
- Face mask.
- Face mask.
Well, I'm still gonna want to take your temperature when we're done here.
When will that be?
It takes about 10 minutes to don, 20 to doff.
(BEEP) man over PA system:
Trauma 100.
MVA.
Three non-critical.
They're gonna need you.
I can do the blood draw on Hans.
Hank, you can't do everything.

We can handle this.
Okay.
Okay, let's go, Margaret.
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.
- Hey... whoa!
You okay?
- (GASPS)
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm good.
I just needed some fresh air.
All right, I need to talk to you about a patient.
Right.
Wait, wait.
(WHISPERS) Hey, come on.
Ix-nay on the arantine-quay.
(WHISPERS) What are you talking about?
Oh, you don't know.
Um, so Hans...
Jill's Hans, he's under quarantine for possible Ebola.
But don't worry.
Even though we came in contact with him, we're not considered persons under investigation unless a positive blood test comes back.
And I acted really quickly, so I'm fully confident that you and your baby are totally...
What are his symptoms?
Just a fever so far.
You know, Ebola's only contagious when someone is symptomatic and only through close and direct contact with infected bodily fluids.
You sound just like Hank.
We both studied medicine.
Oh, really?
You did?
Did you both study running a hospital?
Did you?
Let's just say for a second, okay, hypothetically... let's just say I let this go, and it is Ebola.
What happens?
First, Boris fires me, okay?
Then the community goes into a panic, as Ebola spreads across the entire country until we're in a zombie apocalypse.
Hank disagreed with your zombie apocalypse theory?
Yes. (SIGHS)
But I'm right, right?
I had to call a quarantine.
I don't have all the facts.
Totally get that, but I am right.
While you're worrying about being right,
I'm worried about Lena.
Who's Lena?
She's a HankMed patient with traumatic pancreatitis, which caused pseudocysts.
She needs a laparoscopic procedure...
Are you coming up to a word I'll understand anytime soon?
She's 17 years old, and her parents passed away.
Oh.
Um, well, her guardian will have to clear the surgery.
Her Aunt Rosanna returned my call from an out-of-state number.
She was very vague about where she was, so I'm starting to wonder if she's reliable.
Lena has two younger brothers.
I stopped by to check in on them, but they weren't home.
I just...
I don't know who's watching them.
I'll have a social worker look into it, okay?
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
As airbag burns go, this one's pretty minor.
You can pick up your Bacitracin prescription on the way out.
No hurries.
My dad's just gonna lecture me about being a bad driver anyways.
Hey, you were in an accident.
And it wasn't even my fault.
It was the shoe's fault.
My heel got caught on the floor mat.
Well, maybe stick to flats for a while.
You know what, that may not be a bad idea after all, 'cause now I can go shopping.
You see?
There's always a silver lining.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
(DOOR OPENS)
(SIGHS)
Ugh, I'm so sorry about all this.
Nah, don't be.
This is the best sleep Hans has had in years, thanks to the air conditioning.
It's very luxurious.
Another silver lining.
You know, Hank, you should cut Evan some slack.
Even though he's wrong?
Protocols are designed to cover everything.
Including the hospital's ass.
You remember what it was like dealing with bureaucracy.
I do.
I guess it was just a little easier when you were the administrator.
I was never your boss.
And we didn't always see eye to eye.
I think we did pretty well together.
We did.
I'm so surprised to see you here, even as a favor to your brother.
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe I wanted to see if I still had it in me.
The truth is, I forgot how much fun it is.
Well, mostly.
What about you?
This make you miss the Hamptons?
I miss it every day.
Especially the people, but I love being in Africa.
It's the best decision I've ever made.
I needed to challenge myself, and now I just...
I feel more alive.
It works for you.
You look happy.
Mm.
You look happy too.
Hans?
(PHONE RINGING)
Hey.
Are you okay?
My fever has spiked.
102 degrees.
I didn't see that twist coming, but I did know Jazwick wasn't dead.
(SIGHS) I can't believe that I'm trusting you.
I gave you my word.
Okay.
So remember when Gompho discovered the mystery herbs?
Right.
You mean Ocimum discovered them.
The herbalist.
Oh, I...
I mixed them up.
That's so odd.
Actually, sit down for a minute.
I should recheck your blood pressure.
(SIGHS)
Something wrong?
I'm putting myself into the world of my story.
It's not easy with you here.
I-I don't usually bring people in with me when I write.
Well, I wish I were more of a creative type, so I could keep up.
I don't think of it as creating.
I just follow the characters where they lead me.
I know it sounds strange to say about a fantasy kingdom, but it's very real to me.
I developed a virosome.
What's that?
It's a synthetic vector that combines the carrying capacity and immune advantages of plasmids with the specificity and efficiency of a virus.
And that's what it felt like to me.
I-I followed the data and saw where it led me... from the security of my lab, but I also find good things when I venture out into other worlds.
Um, uh, so... when Oon proposes,
- Astaria says yes.
- Right.
Oh, no, but, uh, he's evil and her brother.
Oh, I...
I don't know why I keep...
You all right?
- Oh.
- Oh.
200 over 130.
That's too high.
Easy.
911.
This is Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.
I have a patient in hypertensive crisis.
- What's your address?
- 40 Timber Lane.
- We're on our way.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna give you Labetalol to temporize your BP.
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
That's good.
He said the Tylenol you gave him helped his fever, but his eye is really swollen.
Okay, um, put him on speaker.
Hans, are you feeling nauseous at all?
No.
But we all know that eye swelling is a late-stage Ebola symptom.
Hey, let's wait for the test results before you start talking like that.
Yeah, Jill's right.
Why would you have a late-stage symptom before any of the early ones?
(DOOR OPENS)
- Hey.
Dr. Roseman just showed up for the evening shift, which means you're free.
Okay, good, good.
I wanna get a closer look at Hans' eye.
All right, I'll help with the PPE.
I just...
I can't figure out why it would only be one eye.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Hans, does your eye feel warm?
My whole face feels warm.
Okay, have you ever had a blowout fracture?
Yes.
Okay, I'm going in.
Whoa, you gotta get in your gear.
He has an infection that's clearly getting worse.
Okay, we have to start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics now, or he could go septic and die while we wait for the Ebola test.
Henry, you go in there without gear, you're quarantined too.
Henry.
So your eye swelling is unilateral, and you haven't had any nausea or vomiting?
When I was 12, I hit my face on the ice and broke the floor of my eye socket.
I was saving my little brother when he fell through.
Of course you were.
And they put in a metal plate?
Yes.
I think your strep throat bacteria spread to the plate, which is acting as a nidus for the bacteria to lodge and multiply.
Bacterial biofilms on the implant.
Exactly.
I hope you're right.
Well, let's prove I am.
Okay, I'm just gonna give you some numbing drops.
Okay, good.
And here we go.
Yep.
Sure looks like an infection.
Let's check it out.
Okay, I'm just gonna add some dye.
And now we just need...
Ah.
I guess I'll have to send it to the lab.
You're looking for a microscope?
Yeah.
A microscope app.
Never know when I'm unable to get to a lab.
(CHUCKLES)
I am definitely getting one of those.
Okay.
Yep, there it is.
Guys?
There are white cells and bacteria in the fluid, which confirms infection.
That's why he has a fever.
- Boys, come on, please.
- Hey.
- (KNOCKING)
- Give it back.
Hey, guys.
How are you?
I'm Evan.
I'm the hospital administrator.
That means boss.
I'm Wes.
This is Ian.
- Hello.
- Hi.
That makes you Lena, right?
So there's a guy refilling the vending machine at the end of the hall.
If you drop my name,
Evan R. Lawson, he'll give you a freebie.
Then you and I could talk.
Go ahead, guys.
- Yes!
- Evan R. Lawson.
Don't forget the R!
So your doctor tells me you're checking out against medical advice?
Yeah, because this stupid hospital, which I guess means you, decided to send a social worker to my house.
Right.
We were just worried about your brothers.
They were at the neighbors', but now there's gonna be a child services investigation and a hearing, so thank you very much for messing up our lives.
So your aunt is away?
(SCOFFS)
When's she coming home?
Tomorrow.
I don't believe you.
Now I'm a liar.
No, you're a survivor.
I know 'cause I used to be one too.
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.
I lost my mom when I was, uh,
I guess a little younger than you.
This is after my dad bailed, so then it was just me and my brother.
We bounced around, but mostly we just had each other.
Does that sound familiar?
(SCOFFS)
Just because you had to take care of your little brother doesn't mean you know anything...
No.
He had to take care of me.
I was the little brother.
So I know how much your brothers need you.
You can't really be there for them if you don't get well.
So... can they stay at the neighbors' for a couple more days?
Can you call off the investigation?
No, but I can be on your side.

- Hey.
- Hi.
Your blood pressure is stabilized.
Um, but your lab results show high sugar and low potassium.
So I ran your cortisol levels, and they confirm Cushing's disease.
What is that?
Uh, an adenoma on your pituitary gland is causing it to release too much ACTH, which stimulates cortisol production.
Your headaches, weakness, bone loss, confusion, high blood pressure were all caused by too much cortisol.
Will I be okay?
After a transsphenoidal adenomectomy, yes.
I love those words, but the only one I understood was "yes."
Um, surgeons will remove the adenoma, through your nose, actually, which is minimally invasive.
You'll be back to work in a couple days.
And until your wrist heals, you can count on me as your stenographer.
Oh, thank you.

Hans' Ebola test came back negative.
And his CT proved that he had strep bacteria on the metal plate in his face.
He'll be okay.
Thanks.
You're very welcome.
For the record though, I knew it.
I knew you would never be able to take directions from your little brother.
If Jill had told you to quarantine a patient, you would've done it.
You wouldn't have challenged her in front of the whole hospital.
It wasn't the whole hospital.
Besides, I was right about Hans.
Yeah, but you didn't know you were right.
I mean, what if it had been Ebola and not just face strep?
Have you even thought about that?
Regardless, at least at HankMed, you dismissed me in private, Henry.
Maybe I dismissed some of your crazy ideas, but I...
Crazy ideas?
Oh, my God.
Crazy ideas?
Crazy ideas that built a successful business, is that what you were gonna say?
Not that you even noticed, actually, because apparently you thought I was just a bookkeeper, since that's all you replaced me with.
Just so you understand,
I was the CEO, CFO, community outreach director, media director, and head of sales.
That's five things.
You replaced me with one thing.
Well, I'm one thing.
I'm a doctor.
So you probably should've talked to me before you ordered a medically unnecessary quarantine in the middle of the ER that I was trying to run, just to help you out.

Welcome to the ER, Dr. Lawson.
But we usually just let the EMTs bring them in.
Oh, okay.
What's your name?
- Barry.
- Hi, Barry, I'm Hank.
Let's take a look at this.
When is the doctor getting here?
I am the doctor.
Oh, uh, call me Dr. Lawson.
So what happened?
I was chopping vegetables for a salad.
This new diet is more work than it's worth.
Suddenly I got dizzy.
Next thing I knew, I was on the floor bleeding.
I must have hit the counter on the way down.
Huh.
Do you have a history of heart disease?
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.
Okay, you said you're on a new diet.
Do you eat a lot of salad?
I do now.
I just went vegetarian.
Dr. Lawson, should I call plastics?
No, I can stitch it myself.
I need a 4.0 Vicryl, 6.0 nylon.
My ER is short on physicians.
You need to delegate.
Uh, all right, call plastics.
But make sure Barry's hematocrit is over 30.
Let me know immediately if it's not.
Got it.
Hi, Hank.
Jill.
I can't believe it!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Well, I was gonna call you, but then I saw your name on the ER board, and I just...
I thought it'd be more fun to surprise you.
Mission accomplished.
Oh, Hank, sorry.
This is Dr. deGroot.
Oh, please, call me Hans.
Hans, nice to meet you.
So what are you doing here?
Well, the foundation had a fundraiser in the city, and they flew us in at the last minute.
And, well, ever since they put a picture of Hans and me on the homepage, we've accidentally become the face of the clinic.
Ah.
And who wouldn't want to open up their checkbook after seeing a photo of this beautiful woman vaccinating a baby?
Okay, look, I'm pretty sure that it's the shirtless shot of you in the rain that tends to seal the deal.
- Huh.
- I gave my shirt to that boy as a makeshift sling.
It was medically necessary.
- Okay.

Hey, so, uh, cancel your plans tonight.
I'm trying to get everyone together for a HankMed family reunion before we head off on the red-eye.

I wondered if you could help me with some antibiotics for the trip back.

Probably strep.

Okay, let me take a look.
Yeah, you do have a low-grade temp... 99.9.
- Any other symptoms?
- Just a sore throat.
Okay, I'm just gonna grab a quick culture.

Hello, Miss Green?
I'm Dr. Sacani from HankMed.
Oh, hi.
Sorry, I got buried in my work, and I forgot you were coming.
That's all right.
I'm familiar with the experience of being lost in one's work.
What can I do for you?
Uh, I've been feeling... well, it's my head, and I...
I just feel...
Is your headache sharp or a dull pain?
Uh, dull at the temples.
Just on and off for a few weeks.
What else?
You just feeling sort of, um, achy, tired, sore, weak?
Weak... that's it.
And my wrist started hurting this morning.
Okay, um, we'll start with an exam.
I'll get some vitals.
Dr. Sacani?
Uh, those bottles have scrolls in them, like the Message Tree from "The Chronicles of Zall."
Are you a C.G. Leviathan fan?
Well, I...
You're obviously familiar with the books.
Uh, very.
There's a book festival in town.
I was thinking of going.
They're gonna have a, uh, a panel on whether Jazwick is really dead.
Sacerdas saw his death in a vision, but the visions have been changeable in the past.
I saw that they were doing that panel.
Are you going?
I-I considered it, but, uh...
It's... crowds make me nervous.
Oh, me too.
But I was hoping I could find out whether Leviathan has finished writing the new installment.
He is as mysterious as his next book.
Even the Internet doesn't know who he really is.
Oh, um, your blood pressure is a bit high, so we should, uh, keep an eye on that.
In the meantime, I'd like to examine your wrist, and I'll draw some blood to check for thyroid irregularities or nutritional deficiencies.
Uh, Ms. Green, what is your first name?
Cindy.
Cin...
Wait... oh.
Cindy Green.
C.G.
You're C.G. Leviathan?
Hey, Lena from the bike crash, right?
- Yeah.
- How's your brother's foot?
He's great.
Back to bouncing off the walls.
Well, you're not.
So what's going on?
I keep throwing up.
Apparently, taco trucks that are Instagram famous can still give you food poisoning.
Okay, well, let's make sure it's not something worse than bad tacos.
Lie back, please.
Does that hurt?
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.
No, I just...
I think that it's just that I'm sore from all the throwing up.
Right, um, Margaret?
We need a CBC, BMP, UPREG, and then start her on Zofran and IV fluids.
- Doctor?
- Hey, um... you're in good hands with Nurse Margaret here.
I'll come back soon to check up on you.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Did you get an executive paper cut from all that business developing?
Uh, no, I'm here 'cause, uh, your department's backed up.
Connecting with patients makes you an amazing concierge doctor, but you can't run the ER like HankMed.
So just... just treat them and move on, okay?
Wait, did you seriously just come down here to tell me to move the meat?
No, I came down here to tell you to move the patients.
Huh.
Like that guy with the cut on his forehead.
- Barry?
- Yes, Barry.
You know you spent 22% more time with him than our average for lacerations?
22%... what happened during that 22%?
Did you learn all his hopes and dreams?
No, I learned that he's on a new vegetarian diet, which caused anemia.
That's why he fainted.
That's what I learned.
- Clear the way!
Bed right here!
- Male, late 40s.
He was found unconscious in his office.
He has no pulse and is not responding to chest compressions.
Okay, thank you.
Let's get him on the bed.
On three... one, two, three.
Okay.
What's this?
Who wears a fanny pack with a suit?
This is not the time.
It's not a fanny pack.
It's a battery.
It's connected to something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop.
He has a Left Ventricular Assist Device in his heart.
Compressions could kill him.
Um, call the cardiothoracic surgeon.
Tell her to prep the OR.
The wire from the battery pack to his pump has been cut.
The pump was the only thing perfusing his body.
Yeah, we don't have time to replace it.
Okay, um, get me a scalpel, electrical tape, a bunch of hemostats, and some cardboard.
We're gonna reconnect the battery.
Thank you.
His SpO2 is below 80.
Ground it.
Okay, good.
He's pinking up.
Nice work, Dr. Lawson.
I've never seen that before.
You hired the right guy for the right day.
I just stumbled into my desk.
Isn't an X-ray a bit overkill?
No, it's an appropriate diagnostic tool given the amount of swelling and tenderness in your wrist.
I got that.
It is fractured, which is surprising, given the low-impact nature of your injury.
Um, I'll splint the wrist for now, and we can put the cast on when the swelling subsides.
It broke so easily.
I...
I know I don't get out much, but I'm not frail.
We'll do some bone density tests to see if there's something else going on.
And your wrist will heal soon, so don't worry.
You'll be typing again in no time.
Wait, I won't be able to type?
How much time is "no time"?
Well, as you yourself wrote,
"The Great Sea can be crossed quickly, but better to cross it safely."
You're worried because you're on a deadline?
Book six is due to my editor next month.
The fans are waiting.
Yes, we are.
What brought you to my books?
Um, I have trouble picking up on unarticulated emotions sometimes, and my therapist recommended your fiction as an intermediary step 'cause the characters often tell you exactly what they're feeling.
But you read me though, just now.
You knew why I was worried.
I must be making progress.
I don't mean to brag.
I have trouble relating to people sometimes too.
They can be so loud and fast.
Everyone coming at you, wanting answers.
That's why I love writing.
My characters quiet down when I tell them to.
- I could type.
- What?
You could dictate, and I could type.
According to Mavis Beacon,
I'm above average in both speed and accuracy.
You should know,
I am bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, not to divulge any secrets I may learn about Zall.
Is this you being nice or you wanting to know what happens in book six?
Um, both.
So what else is new?
I miss caffeine.
Well, on the plus side, you are the most beautiful pregnant woman ever.
Can you please come over every morning and tell me that when I can't fit into anything?
Deal.
In a few weeks, I don't know where you're gonna be coming to.
Still no word from Johns Hopkins?
Nope, nothing yet.
Well, be patient.
You'll end up where you're supposed to be.
What matters is that you're taking a leave.

Yeah, remember how terrified I was?
But once I realized it was my dream, there was no turning back.
Hey...

- I did.
So how's it going in the ER?
Yeah, word is you pulled off this miraculous save with cardboard and duct tape?
Oh, uh, actually, it was electrical tape.
Oh.
You do know the point of an ER is that they have all the equipment that you need that you don't need to build some crazy contraption like you do at HankMed?
I had to rewire an LVAD on the fly.
I mean, they don't exactly have a tool for that lying around.
Some things don't change.
It is so good to all be together again.
You sure you can't stay awhile?
I really wish I could, but we've got so much going on right now.
The foundation wants to send me to some of their other clinics to introduce our new health care training initiative.
Jill is being modest.
She designed the program herself, and because it's been so successful, they wanna put it in clinics all over the world.
Oh, my God.
That sounds incredible.
Thank you.
Ugh, I'm all set for the trip back.

He even saved the goat.

Oh, how nice for you.
Mine means "son of Lawrence." -

Is her pancreatitis acting up?
Pancreatitis?
She didn't mention that.
Excuse us a moment.
- Hey, Lena.
- You okay?
Why didn't you tell me about your pancreatitis?
Because I'm better now.
That was, like, forever ago.
Well, you may not be completely better.
Your vomiting could be caused by pancreatic pseudocysts.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry, I really need to get going.
No, you really need to stay here.
If you have pseudocysts, we have to drain them.
Otherwise they could rupture.
Please, come back with us.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Evan, thank you for sending so many supplies to the clinic.
Oh, of course.
Yeah, Hamptons Heritage is always happy to do what we can for the, uh, people of...
- Sierra Leone.
- Sierra Leone.
That's right, and all nations, really.
That's why I paused just then.
I was gonna list them all.
Uh, have you guys seen Hank yet?
Yeah, uh, in the ER, of all places.
Mm-hmm.
And he helped me out with a much needed prescription.
Oh, I hope everything's okay.
Yeah, just running a slight fever.
And you were just in Sierra Leone?
Right this way, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, nice and easy.
Code quarantine, ER.
Code 529.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Quarantine.
Down the hall to the right or left.
Keep calm.
Look the other way.
All right, this is clear.
Guys, guys, what's happening?
I forgot about first-world bureaucracy.
We're activating quarantine protocol.
If a patient possibly has Ebola...
Ebola?
He has strep.
He has a fever and was just in Sierra Leone.
Okay, okay.
Help me out here.
Was Hans in an area where there have been reported cases of Ebola?
There have been no recent cases.
Right, and he's showing no other symptoms.
If a patient presents with a fever and has just visited an outbreak region,
I have to quarantine, okay, until we get the results of a blood test.
Ev, you're overreacting.
I'm following protocol.
Let's go, guys.
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.
Paper booties.
Damn it.
"Dan's Papers" has it already.
Evan R. Lawson.
No, no, no.
This is not a crisis.
Sanitize your hands thoroughly.
There's a chart on the wall.
Yeah, don't need a chart.
No, that's not true.
We're just covering our bases.
That's right.
I've notified the DOHMH.
Now we're just waiting for the LRN to finish EVD testing.
And, uh... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Make sure to let the sanitizer dry completely before putting the gloves on."
Yeah, why don't I take over the checklist?
- No, it's...
- I know protocol.
Thank you.
- Nitrile gloves.
- Nitrile gloves.
Well, no comment.
No, sorry, bye.
Evan R. Lawson.
Yes, thank you for calling back.
Uh-huh, yes, this is definitely a crisis.
We need CDC backup, ASAP.
You know, Jill, I'm the Ebola lead here.
I need to ask if you traveled to Sierra Leone.
No.
Hans went alone.
Okay, disposable gown.
What about your contact with Hans?
I thought you weren't worried about Ebola.
I'm not, but I'm worried about you.
Hans came straight from Sierra Leone, and we met up at the fundraiser, but he left early because he had a sore throat.
- Face mask.
- Face mask.
Well, I'm still gonna want to take your temperature when we're done here.
When will that be?
It takes about 10 minutes to don, 20 to doff.
man over PA system:
Trauma 100.
MVA.
Three non-critical.
They're gonna need you.
I can do the blood draw on Hans.
Hank, you can't do everything.
All right?
We can handle this.
Okay.
Okay, let's go, Margaret.
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.
Hey... whoa!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm good.
I just needed some fresh air.
All right, I need to talk to you about a patient.
Right.
Wait, wait.
Hey, come on.
Ix-nay on the arantine-quay.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you don't know.
Um, so Hans...
Jill's Hans, he's under quarantine for possible Ebola.
But don't worry.
Even though we came in contact with him, we're not considered persons under investigation unless a positive blood test comes back.
And I acted really quickly, so I'm fully confident that you and your baby are totally...
What are his symptoms?
Just a fever so far.
You know, Ebola's only contagious when someone is symptomatic and only through close and direct contact with infected bodily fluids.
You sound just like Hank.
We both studied medicine.
Oh, really?
You did?
Did you both study running a hospital?
Did you?
Let's just say for a second, okay, hypothetically... let's just say I let this go, and it is Ebola.
What happens?
First, Boris fires me, okay?
Then the community goes into a panic, as Ebola spreads across the entire country until we're in a zombie apocalypse.
Hank disagreed with your zombie apocalypse theory?
Yes.
But I'm right, right?
I had to call a quarantine.
I don't have all the facts.
Totally get that, but I am right.
While you're worrying about being right,
I'm worried about Lena.
Who's Lena?
She's a HankMed patient with traumatic pancreatitis, which caused pseudocysts.
She needs a laparoscopic procedure...
Are you coming up to a word I'll understand anytime soon?
She's 17 years old, and her parents passed away.
Oh.
Um, well, her guardian will have to clear the surgery.
Her Aunt Rosanna returned my call from an out-of-state number.
She was very vague about where she was, so I'm starting to wonder if she's reliable.
Lena has two younger brothers.
I stopped by to check in on them, but they weren't home.
I just...
I don't know who's watching them.
I'll have a social worker look into it, okay?
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
As airbag burns go, this one's pretty minor.
You can pick up your Bacitracin prescription on the way out.
No hurries.
My dad's just gonna lecture me about being a bad driver anyways.
Hey, you were in an accident.
And it wasn't even my fault.
It was the shoe's fault.
My heel got caught on the floor mat.
Well, maybe stick to flats for a while.
You know what, that may not be a bad idea after all, 'cause now I can go shopping.
You see?
There's always a silver lining.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
Ugh, I'm so sorry about all this.
Nah, don't be.
This is the best sleep Hans has had in years, thanks to the air conditioning.
It's very luxurious.
Another silver lining.
You know, Hank, you should cut Evan some slack.
Even though he's wrong?
Protocols are designed to cover everything.
Including the hospital's ass.
You remember what it was like dealing with bureaucracy.
I do.
I guess it was just a little easier when you were the administrator.
I was never your boss.
And we didn't always see eye to eye.
I think we did pretty well together.
We did.
I'm so surprised to see you here, even as a favor to your brother.
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe I wanted to see if I still had it in me.
The truth is, I forgot how much fun it is.
Well, mostly.
What about you?
This make you miss the Hamptons?
I miss it every day.
Especially the people, but I love being in Africa.
It's the best decision I've ever made.
I needed to challenge myself, and now I just...
I feel more alive.
It works for you.
You look happy.
Mm.
You look happy too.
Hans?
Hey.
Are you okay?
My fever has spiked.
102 degrees.
I didn't see that twist coming, but I did know Jazwick wasn't dead.
I can't believe that I'm trusting you.
I gave you my word.
Okay.
So remember when Gompho discovered the mystery herbs?
Right.
You mean Ocimum discovered them.
The herbalist.
Oh, I...
I mixed them up.
That's so odd.
Actually, sit down for a minute.
I should recheck your blood pressure.
Something wrong?
I'm putting myself into the world of my story.
It's not easy with you here.
I-I don't usually bring people in with me when I write.
Well, I wish I were more of a creative type, so I could keep up.
I don't think of it as creating.
I just follow the characters where they lead me.
I know it sounds strange to say about a fantasy kingdom, but it's very real to me.
I developed a virosome.
What's that?
It's a synthetic vector that combines the carrying capacity and immune advantages of plasmids with the specificity and efficiency of a virus.
And that's what it felt like to me.
I-I followed the data and saw where it led me... from the security of my lab, but I also find good things when I venture out into other worlds.
Um, uh, so... when Oon proposes,
- Astaria says yes.
- Right.
Oh, no, but, uh, he's evil and her brother.
Oh, I...
I don't know why I keep...
You all right?
- Oh.
- Oh.
200 over 130.
That's too high.
Easy.
911.
This is Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.
I have a patient in hypertensive crisis.
- What's your address?
- 40 Timber Lane.
- We're on our way.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna give you Labetalol to temporize your BP.
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
That's good.
He said the Tylenol you gave him helped his fever, but his eye is really swollen.
Okay, um, put him on speaker.
Hans, are you feeling nauseous at all?
No.
But we all know that eye swelling is a late-stage Ebola symptom.
Hey, let's wait for the test results before you start talking like that.
Yeah, Jill's right.
Why would you have a late-stage symptom before any of the early ones?
- Hey.
Dr. Roseman just showed up for the evening shift, which means you're free.
Okay, good, good.
I wanna get a closer look at Hans' eye.
All right, I'll help with the PPE.
I just...
I can't figure out why it would only be one eye.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Hans, does your eye feel warm?
My whole face feels warm.
Okay, have you ever had a blowout fracture?
Yes.
Okay, I'm going in.
Whoa, you gotta get in your gear.
He has an infection that's clearly getting worse.
Okay, we have to start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics now, or he could go septic and die while we wait for the Ebola test.
Henry, you go in there without gear, you're quarantined too.
Henry.
So your eye swelling is unilateral, and you haven't had any nausea or vomiting?
When I was 12, I hit my face on the ice and broke the floor of my eye socket.
I was saving my little brother when he fell through.
Of course you were.
And they put in a metal plate?
Yes.
I think your strep throat bacteria spread to the plate, which is acting as a nidus for the bacteria to lodge and multiply.
Bacterial biofilms on the implant.
Exactly.
I hope you're right.
Well, let's prove I am.
Okay, I'm just gonna give you some numbing drops.
Okay, good.
And here we go.
Yep.
Sure looks like an infection.
Let's check it out.
Okay, I'm just gonna add some dye.
And now we just need...
Ah.
I guess I'll have to send it to the lab.
You're looking for a microscope?
Yeah.
A microscope app.
Never know when I'm unable to get to a lab.
I am definitely getting one of those.
Okay.
Yep, there it is.
Guys?
There are white cells and bacteria in the fluid, which confirms infection.
That's why he has a fever.
- Boys, come on, please.
- Hey.
Give it back.
Hey, guys.
How are you?
I'm Evan.
I'm the hospital administrator.
That means boss.
I'm Wes.
This is Ian.
- Hello.
- Hi.
That makes you Lena, right?
So there's a guy refilling the vending machine at the end of the hall.
If you drop my name,
Evan R. Lawson, he'll give you a freebie.
Then you and I could talk.
Go ahead, guys.
- Yes!
- Evan R. Lawson.
Don't forget the R!
So your doctor tells me you're checking out against medical advice?
Yeah, because this stupid hospital, which I guess means you, decided to send a social worker to my house.
Right.
We were just worried about your brothers.
They were at the neighbors', but now there's gonna be a child services investigation and a hearing, so thank you very much for messing up our lives.
So your aunt is away?
When's she coming home?
Tomorrow.
I don't believe you.
Now I'm a liar.
No, you're a survivor.
I know 'cause I used to be one too.
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.
I lost my mom when I was, uh,
I guess a little younger than you.
This is after my dad bailed, so then it was just me and my brother.
We bounced around, but mostly we just had each other.
Does that sound familiar?
Just because you had to take care of your little brother doesn't mean you know anything...
No.
He had to take care of me.
I was the little brother.
So I know how much your brothers need you.
You can't really be there for them if you don't get well.
So... can they stay at the neighbors' for a couple more days?
Can you call off the investigation?
No, but I can be on your side.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Your blood pressure is stabilized.
Um, but your lab results show high sugar and low potassium.
So I ran your cortisol levels, and they confirm Cushing's disease.
What is that?
Uh, an adenoma on your pituitary gland is causing it to release too much ACTH, which stimulates cortisol production.
Your headaches, weakness, bone loss, confusion, high blood pressure were all caused by too much cortisol.
Will I be okay?
After a transsphenoidal adenomectomy, yes.
I love those words, but the only one I understood was "yes."
Um, surgeons will remove the adenoma, through your nose, actually, which is minimally invasive.
You'll be back to work in a couple days.
And until your wrist heals, you can count on me as your stenographer.
Oh, thank you.
My editor thanks you too.
Speaking of Zall, I had a thought.
If I could get you out of the hospital for a few hours before the surgery, would you accompany me on a quest?
Yes, I assure you the crisis is under control.
Hold on for one second.
I told you there's no news story here, 'cause there was never a crisis.
It...
I'll call you back.
Don't worry, I'm not contagious.
Hans' Ebola test came back negative.
And his CT proved that he had strep bacteria on the metal plate in his face.
He'll be okay.
Thanks.
You're very welcome.
For the record though, I knew it.
I knew you would never be able to take directions from your little brother.
If Jill had told you to quarantine a patient, you would've done it.
You wouldn't have challenged her in front of the whole hospital.
It wasn't the whole hospital.
Besides, I was right about Hans.
Yeah, but you didn't know you were right.
I mean, what if it had been Ebola and not just face strep?
Have you even thought about that?
Regardless, at least at HankMed, you dismissed me in private, Henry.
Maybe I dismissed some of your crazy ideas, but I...
Crazy ideas?
Oh, my God.
Crazy ideas?
Crazy ideas that built a successful business, is that what you were gonna say?
Not that you even noticed, actually, because apparently you thought I was just a bookkeeper, since that's all you replaced me with.
Just so you understand,
I was the CEO, CFO, community outreach director, media director, and head of sales.
That's five things.
You replaced me with one thing.
Well, I'm one thing.
I'm a doctor.
So you probably should've talked to me before you ordered a medically unnecessary quarantine in the middle of the ER that I was trying to run, just to help you out.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a conversation.
And I'm in the middle of an important job.
Evan R. Lawson.
Yeah, no, I got plenty of time to talk.
What's up?
Wait a minute, what?
Oh, my God.
Well, I thought the muffin selection in the cafeteria was pretty good.
I don't know who authorized that.
- Okay.
- Well, Cloris...
No, no, no, Cloris, absolutely.
Muffins are by far the most important thing
I have going on right now, so...
- Okay, give it.
- No, I'm not gonna...
- Give it.
- Stop it.
Then hang up, so we can talk.
- No.
- Give it to me!
- Give me your phone!
- Oh, my...
Henry, are you really doing this?
- I'm really doing this!
- Hold on, Cloris!
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I have your leg.
Give it, give it, give it!
It's mine!
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Ev.
Ev!
Hmm, yeah, it hurts.
Yep, you definitely scratched your cornea.
You mean you scratched my cornea.
So I'll give you some drops, and you'll have to wear an eye patch for a few days.
Like a pirate?
My staff's gonna have a field day.
You know, technically you're not adhering to the call panel.
I mean, you should really be waiting for ophthalmology.
Oh, so now you wanna start following protocol?
Well, I don't want to upset the administrator.
Oh, my... you know what?
This whole...
All right, look, look, look.
You were right.
I shouldn't have questioned your authority.
But for the record...
I didn't replace you with a bookkeeper.
I hired one because I didn't want anyone else to be HankMed's CFO, and I kinda hoped that once you'd settled into your job here, you'd have more time for HankMed.
Right.
So you could keep belittling me, right?
No.
Because I miss you.
Huh?
I miss you.
It's strange not having you there every day.
And I know sometimes we argue, like today, but...
I don't know, that's us, and I just... miss us.
I miss us too.
All right, it's eye patch time.
This is great.
It's gonna be a good look for you.
Just hold that in place.
- Huh.
- What?
What?
Just, um, open wide.
My... my mouth?
Your mouth.
Open wide and say,
"Ahh..."
- Ahh...
"Arrr, matey!"
I hate you.
Yeah, I hate you too.
Your roots are showing.
Tree puns.
Clever.
It doesn't look that busy.
Well, the website did say that the panel would be at the back of the...
Wow.
They're all here for my books?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
That's too many people.
Ugh, maybe we should go.
I...
I...
I can read about the panel online.
Astaria, we are on a quest.
Don't worry, we'll blend right in.
Just have to act like a couple of nerds.
I think we can do that.
Hey, thank you for your help with Lena.
Yeah.
Hopefully the social services investigation will light a fire under her aunt, but, uh, Lena's not too happy about it.
You did what you had to do.
Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Aw, I really wish we didn't have to catch this flight tonight.
It wasn't much of a reunion with the quarantine and all.
Yeah, sorry about that, even though I'd order it all over again.
- Oh, God, really?
- No doubt.
Totally understand, Evan.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
And, Hank, thank you for everything.
Of course.
It was great to meet you, Hans.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Evan, I think you are doing a great job with my old job.
- Really?
- Yes.
Thank you so much, Jill.
Big shoes to fill.
Divya, I want pictures of the new baby
- and more pictures of Sashi and...
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, the whole family, just keep 'em coming, okay?
- Promise?
- Promise.
Oh, you're gonna be a fantastic doctor.
Come back soon, please.
Yeah.
Ah.
- It was so good to see you.
- You too.
I feel like we barely had a chance to talk.
I know.
- Maybe...
- Jill!
- Good-bye, Jill.
- Good-bye, Hank.
Well, she found a great guy.
Huh?
Hans.
Oh, God, you thought that...
What?
What?
Oh, Hank, Hans is gay.
- He is?
- Yeah.
- So they're not...
- No.
We really need to get Hank on Facebook.
Or what, are you gonna make him walk the plank?
Yeah.
Previously on "Royal Pains"...
Help!
Someone please help my brother.
Hang in there, Ian.
I promise you'll get your foot back in a sec.
I'd like to speak to your folks anyway.
They're not around, but, uh, do you have, like, a card or something?
I've actually been in a lot of pain since the bike accident.
It looks like pancreatitis, so I'll need to reexamine you at some point.
And I'd like to talk to your aunt so that she knows what's going...
Yeah, that's fine.
All right, check with the ER in Riverhead then.
Just get back to me, ASAP though, okay?
All right, bye.
Really?
Two phones?
You know you're running a hospital, not a stock exchange, right?
One for hospital business development, one for staffing.
And one for HankMed.
This one usually stays in the bag though 'cause three phones would look ridiculous.
Plus, you pretty much got the day-to-day handled over there anyway.
Well, not today.
The bookkeeper dropped off these spreadsheets.
I need you to decipher them, please.
Looks like we're low on retainers.
Oh, my God.
What, business development emergency?
No.
Emergency room emergency.
Most of the physicians have come down with this awful summer cold right when the head of ER is on vacation, so it's just causing a whole bunch of...
Oh, my God!
Now Dr. Roseman can't make it back till later today.
I gotta go.
I gotta find someone to cover the ER.
I could do it.
You?
Yeah, I could cover the shift.
It took the threat of an international incident to make you an attending, and that was just on paper.
You're House Call Hank, not Hospital Hank.
For you, I can make an exception.
I'll even give you a family discount.
- Morning, Jeremiah.
- Yes, it is.
Any chance you can help me with appointments?
It's just you and me today.
Of course, I've been working on these data tables for hours.
I could use a break.
What?
You just called seeing patients a break.
You've come a long way since you were isolating yourself in here.
Why is it just the two of us today?
- What do we got?
- Male, 30s.
Syncope.
Full-thickness forehead laceration.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Clear the way.
Welcome to the ER, Dr. Lawson.
But we usually just let the EMTs bring them in.
Oh, okay.
What's your name?
- Barry.
- Hi, Barry, I'm Hank.
Let's take a look at this.
When is the doctor getting here?
I am the doctor.
Oh, uh, call me Dr. Lawson.
So what happened?
I was chopping vegetables for a salad.
This new diet is more work than it's worth.
Suddenly I got dizzy.
Next thing I knew, I was on the floor bleeding.
I must have hit the counter on the way down.
Huh.
Do you have a history of heart disease?
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.
Okay, you said you're on a new diet.
Do you eat a lot of salad?
I do now.
I just went vegetarian.
Dr. Lawson, should I call plastics?
No, I can stitch it myself.
I need a 4.0 Vicryl, 6.0 nylon.
My ER is short on physicians.
You need to delegate.
Uh, all right, call plastics.
But make sure Barry's hematocrit is over 30.
Let me know immediately if it's not.
Got it.
Hi, Hank.
Jill.
I can't believe it!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Well, I was gonna call you, but then I saw your name on the ER board, and I just...
I thought it'd be more fun to surprise you.
Mission accomplished.
Oh, Hank, sorry.
This is Dr. deGroot.
Oh, please, call me Hans.
Hans, nice to meet you.
So what are you doing here?
Well, the foundation had a fundraiser in the city, and they flew us in at the last minute.
And, well, ever since they put a picture of Hans and me on the homepage, we've accidentally become the face of the clinic.
Ah.
And who wouldn't want to open up their checkbook after seeing a photo of this beautiful woman vaccinating a baby?
Okay, look, I'm pretty sure that it's the shirtless shot of you in the rain that tends to seal the deal.
- Huh.
- I gave my shirt to that boy as a makeshift sling.
It was medically necessary.
- Okay.
- Huh.
Hey, so, uh, cancel your plans tonight.
I'm trying to get everyone together for a HankMed family reunion before we head off on the red-eye.
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Good.
And if it's not too much to ask,
I wondered if you could help me with some antibiotics for the trip back.
I have a sore throat.
Probably strep.
Been getting it a lot.
Okay, let me take a look.
Yeah, you do have a low-grade temp... 99.9.
- Any other symptoms?
- Just a sore throat.
Okay, I'm just gonna grab a quick culture.
Open up, please.
Great.
Wow.
I never thought I would see Hank Lawson back in the ER.
What brought you in from the cold?
Ah, it's just for today.
Long story.
- I'll tell you tonight.
- Okay.
- Jill?
Oh, my gosh!
- Hey!
Aww, my favorite ER taskmaster... hi!
Wow.
We need to catch up.
And, Dr. Lawson, we've got an ingrown toenail with paronychia.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Um, here is a script for penicillin, and I will let you know the results of the strep test.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
So good to see you.
So yeah, I'll see you tonight, okay?
All right, great.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
Nice to meet you, Hans.
Bye.
Dr. Lawson?
- Dr. Lawson!
- Yes, right.
Coming.
Hello, Miss Green?
I'm Dr. Sacani from HankMed.
Oh, hi.
Sorry, I got buried in my work, and I forgot you were coming.
That's all right.
I'm familiar with the experience of being lost in one's work.
What can I do for you?
Uh, I've been feeling... well, it's my head, and I...
I just feel...
Is your headache sharp or a dull pain?
Uh, dull at the temples.
Just on and off for a few weeks.
What else?
You just feeling sort of, um, achy, tired, sore, weak?
Weak... that's it.
And my wrist started hurting this morning.
Okay, um, we'll start with an exam.
I'll get some vitals.
Dr. Sacani?
Uh, those bottles have scrolls in them, like the Message Tree from "The Chronicles of Zall."
Are you a C.G. Leviathan fan?
Well, I...
You're obviously familiar with the books.
Uh, very.
There's a book festival in town.
I was thinking of going.
They're gonna have a, uh, a panel on whether Jazwick is really dead.
Sacerdas saw his death in a vision, but the visions have been changeable in the past.
I saw that they were doing that panel.
Are you going?
I-I considered it, but, uh...
It's... crowds make me nervous.
Oh, me too.
But I was hoping I could find out whether Leviathan has finished writing the new installment.
He is as mysterious as his next book.
Even the Internet doesn't know who he really is.
Oh, um, your blood pressure is a bit high, so we should, uh, keep an eye on that.
In the meantime, I'd like to examine your wrist, and I'll draw some blood to check for thyroid irregularities or nutritional deficiencies.
Uh, Ms. Green, what is your first name?
Cindy.
Cin...
Wait... oh.
Cindy Green.
C.G.
You're C.G. Leviathan?
Hey, Lena from the bike crash, right?
- Yeah.
- How's your brother's foot?
He's great.
Back to bouncing off the walls.
Well, you're not.
So what's going on?
I keep throwing up.
Apparently, taco trucks that are Instagram famous can still give you food poisoning.
Okay, well, let's make sure it's not something worse than bad tacos.
Lie back, please.
Does that hurt?
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.
No, I just...
I think that it's just that I'm sore from all the throwing up.
Right, um, Margaret?
We need a CBC, BMP, UPREG, and then start her on Zofran and IV fluids.
- Doctor?
- Hey, um... you're in good hands with Nurse Margaret here.
I'll come back soon to check up on you.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Did you get an executive paper cut from all that business developing?
Uh, no, I'm here 'cause, uh, your department's backed up.
Connecting with patients makes you an amazing concierge doctor, but you can't run the ER like HankMed.
So just... just treat them and move on, okay?
Wait, did you seriously just come down here to tell me to move the meat?
No, I came down here to tell you to move the patients.
Huh.
Like that guy with the cut on his forehead.
- Barry?
- Yes, Barry.
You know you spent 22% more time with him than our average for lacerations?
22%... what happened during that 22%?
Did you learn all his hopes and dreams?
No, I learned that he's on a new vegetarian diet, which caused anemia.
That's why he fainted.
That's what I learned.
- Clear the way!
Bed right here!
- Male, late 40s.
He was found unconscious in his office.
He has no pulse and is not responding to chest compressions.
Okay, thank you.
Let's get him on the bed.
On three... one, two, three.
Okay.
What's this?
Who wears a fanny pack with a suit?
This is not the time.
It's not a fanny pack.
It's a battery.
It's connected to something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop.
He has a Left Ventricular Assist Device in his heart.
Compressions could kill him.
Um, call the cardiothoracic surgeon.
Tell her to prep the OR.
The wire from the battery pack to his pump has been cut.
The pump was the only thing perfusing his body.
Yeah, we don't have time to replace it.
Okay, um, get me a scalpel, electrical tape, a bunch of hemostats, and some cardboard.
We're gonna reconnect the battery.
Thank you.
His SpO2 is below 80.
Ground it.
Okay, good.
He's pinking up.
Nice work, Dr. Lawson.
I've never seen that before.
You hired the right guy for the right day.
I just stumbled into my desk.
Isn't an X-ray a bit overkill?
No, it's an appropriate diagnostic tool given the amount of swelling and tenderness in your wrist.
I got that.
It is fractured, which is surprising, given the low-impact nature of your injury.
Um, I'll splint the wrist for now, and we can put the cast on when the swelling subsides.
It broke so easily.
I...
I know I don't get out much, but I'm not frail.
We'll do some bone density tests to see if there's something else going on.
And your wrist will heal soon, so don't worry.
You'll be typing again in no time.
Wait, I won't be able to type?
How much time is "no time"?
Well, as you yourself wrote,
"The Great Sea can be crossed quickly, but better to cross it safely."
You're worried because you're on a deadline?
Book six is due to my editor next month.
The fans are waiting.
Yes, we are.
What brought you to my books?
Um, I have trouble picking up on unarticulated emotions sometimes, and my therapist recommended your fiction as an intermediary step 'cause the characters often tell you exactly what they're feeling.
But you read me though, just now.
You knew why I was worried.
I must be making progress.
I don't mean to brag.
I have trouble relating to people sometimes too.
They can be so loud and fast.
Everyone coming at you, wanting answers.
That's why I love writing.
My characters quiet down when I tell them to.
- I could type.
- What?
You could dictate, and I could type.
According to Mavis Beacon,
I'm above average in both speed and accuracy.
You should know,
I am bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, not to divulge any secrets I may learn about Zall.
Is this you being nice or you wanting to know what happens in book six?
Um, both.
So what else is new?
I miss caffeine.
Well, on the plus side, you are the most beautiful pregnant woman ever.
Can you please come over every morning and tell me that when I can't fit into anything?
Deal.
In a few weeks, I don't know where you're gonna be coming to.
Still no word from Johns Hopkins?
Nope, nothing yet.
Well, be patient.
You'll end up where you're supposed to be.
What matters is that you're taking a leave.
Like you did.
Yeah, remember how terrified I was?
But once I realized it was my dream, there was no turning back.
Hey...
I am so proud of you.
Sometimes I think I'm crazy for taking this on, Jill.
The Divya Katdare I know can handle it all.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Here you go.
Extra hot, extra shot.
- You remembered.
- I did.
So how's it going in the ER?
Yeah, word is you pulled off this miraculous save with cardboard and duct tape?
Oh, uh, actually, it was electrical tape.
Oh.
You do know the point of an ER is that they have all the equipment that you need that you don't need to build some crazy contraption like you do at HankMed?
I had to rewire an LVAD on the fly.
I mean, they don't exactly have a tool for that lying around.
Some things don't change.
It is so good to all be together again.
You sure you can't stay awhile?
I really wish I could, but we've got so much going on right now.
The foundation wants to send me to some of their other clinics to introduce our new health care training initiative.
Jill is being modest.
She designed the program herself, and because it's been so successful, they wanna put it in clinics all over the world.
Oh, my God.
That sounds incredible.
Thank you.
Ugh, I'm all set for the trip back.
First-world medicine is amazing.
Hans, I'm so glad to finally meet you on this trip.
I've heard so much about you.
You have?
Well, yeah, hello!
The monsoon story?
- The monsoon story.
- Oh, right, right, right.
When there was a puddle so big outside Jill's bungalow that people were actually fishing in it.
Yeah, no.
The other monsoon story.
When the village flooded and Hans improvised a rope bridge across the ravine.
He even saved the goat.
Ah.
I just knew the right knots to tie.
At last, my scouting days in Naaldenveld gave me something besides chigger bites.
And what did the grateful villagers call you?
Dr. Big One.
- Dr. Big One?
- Mm.
His surname, deGroot, translates that way.
Oh, how nice for you.
Mine means "son of Lawrence." -
Hey, isn't that Lena Crawford?
Is her pancreatitis acting up?
Pancreatitis?
She didn't mention that.
Excuse us a moment.
- Hey, Lena.
- You okay?
Why didn't you tell me about your pancreatitis?
Because I'm better now.
That was, like, forever ago.
Well, you may not be completely better.
Your vomiting could be caused by pancreatic pseudocysts.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry, I really need to get going.
No, you really need to stay here.
If you have pseudocysts, we have to drain them.
Otherwise they could rupture.
Please, come back with us.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Evan, thank you for sending so many supplies to the clinic.
Oh, of course.
Yeah, Hamptons Heritage is always happy to do what we can for the, uh, people of...
- Sierra Leone.
- Sierra Leone.
That's right, and all nations, really.
That's why I paused just then.
I was gonna list them all.
Uh, have you guys seen Hank yet?
Yeah, uh, in the ER, of all places.
Mm-hmm.
And he helped me out with a much needed prescription.
Oh, I hope everything's okay.
Yeah, just running a slight fever.
And you were just in Sierra Leone?
Right this way, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, nice and easy.
Code quarantine, ER.
Code 529.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Quarantine.
Down the hall to the right or left.
Keep calm.
Look the other way.
All right, this is clear.
Guys, guys, what's happening?
I forgot about first-world bureaucracy.
We're activating quarantine protocol.
If a patient possibly has Ebola...
Ebola?
He has strep.
He has a fever and was just in Sierra Leone.
Okay, okay.
Help me out here.
Was Hans in an area where there have been reported cases of Ebola?
There have been no recent cases.
Right, and he's showing no other symptoms.
If a patient presents with a fever and has just visited an outbreak region,
I have to quarantine, okay, until we get the results of a blood test.
Ev, you're overreacting.
I'm following protocol.
Let's go, guys.
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.
Paper booties.
Damn it.
"Dan's Papers" has it already.
Evan R. Lawson.
No, no, no.
This is not a crisis.
Sanitize your hands thoroughly.
There's a chart on the wall.
Yeah, don't need a chart.
No, that's not true.
We're just covering our bases.
That's right.
I've notified the DOHMH.
Now we're just waiting for the LRN to finish EVD testing.
And, uh... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Make sure to let the sanitizer dry completely before putting the gloves on."
Yeah, why don't I take over the checklist?
- No, it's...
- I know protocol.
Thank you.
- Nitrile gloves.
- Nitrile gloves.
Well, no comment.
No, sorry, bye.
Evan R. Lawson.
Yes, thank you for calling back.
Uh-huh, yes, this is definitely a crisis.
We need CDC backup, ASAP.
You know, Jill, I'm the Ebola lead here.
I need to ask if you traveled to Sierra Leone.
No.
Hans went alone.
Okay, disposable gown.
What about your contact with Hans?
I thought you weren't worried about Ebola.
I'm not, but I'm worried about you.
Hans came straight from Sierra Leone, and we met up at the fundraiser, but he left early because he had a sore throat.
- Face mask.
- Face mask.
Well, I'm still gonna want to take your temperature when we're done here.
When will that be?
It takes about 10 minutes to don, 20 to doff.
man over PA system:
Trauma 100.
MVA.
Three non-critical.
They're gonna need you.
I can do the blood draw on Hans.
Hank, you can't do everything.
All right?
We can handle this.
Okay.
Okay, let's go, Margaret.
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.
Hey... whoa!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm good.
I just needed some fresh air.
All right, I need to talk to you about a patient.
Right.
Wait, wait.
Hey, come on.
Ix-nay on the arantine-quay.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you don't know.
Um, so Hans...
Jill's Hans, he's under quarantine for possible Ebola.
But don't worry.
Even though we came in contact with him, we're not considered persons under investigation unless a positive blood test comes back.
And I acted really quickly, so I'm fully confident that you and your baby are totally...
What are his symptoms?
Just a fever so far.
You know, Ebola's only contagious when someone is symptomatic and only through close and direct contact with infected bodily fluids.
You sound just like Hank.
We both studied medicine.
Oh, really?
You did?
Did you both study running a hospital?
Did you?
Let's just say for a second, okay, hypothetically... let's just say I let this go, and it is Ebola.
What happens?
First, Boris fires me, okay?
Then the community goes into a panic, as Ebola spreads across the entire country until we're in a zombie apocalypse.
Hank disagreed with your zombie apocalypse theory?
Yes.
But I'm right, right?
I had to call a quarantine.
I don't have all the facts.
Totally get that, but I am right.
While you're worrying about being right,
I'm worried about Lena.
Who's Lena?
She's a HankMed patient with traumatic pancreatitis, which caused pseudocysts.
She needs a laparoscopic procedure...
Are you coming up to a word I'll understand anytime soon?
She's 17 years old, and her parents passed away.
Oh.
Um, well, her guardian will have to clear the surgery.
Her Aunt Rosanna returned my call from an out-of-state number.
She was very vague about where she was, so I'm starting to wonder if she's reliable.
Lena has two younger brothers.
I stopped by to check in on them, but they weren't home.
I just...
I don't know who's watching them.
I'll have a social worker look into it, okay?
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
As airbag burns go, this one's pretty minor.
You can pick up your Bacitracin prescription on the way out.
No hurries.
My dad's just gonna lecture me about being a bad driver anyways.
Hey, you were in an accident.
And it wasn't even my fault.
It was the shoe's fault.
My heel got caught on the floor mat.
Well, maybe stick to flats for a while.
You know what, that may not be a bad idea after all, 'cause now I can go shopping.
You see?
There's always a silver lining.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
Ugh, I'm so sorry about all this.
Nah, don't be.
This is the best sleep Hans has had in years, thanks to the air conditioning.
It's very luxurious.
Another silver lining.
You know, Hank, you should cut Evan some slack.
Even though he's wrong?
Protocols are designed to cover everything.
Including the hospital's ass.
You remember what it was like dealing with bureaucracy.
I do.
I guess it was just a little easier when you were the administrator.
I was never your boss.
And we didn't always see eye to eye.
I think we did pretty well together.
We did.
I'm so surprised to see you here, even as a favor to your brother.
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe I wanted to see if I still had it in me.
The truth is, I forgot how much fun it is.
Well, mostly.
What about you?
This make you miss the Hamptons?
I miss it every day.
Especially the people, but I love being in Africa.
It's the best decision I've ever made.
I needed to challenge myself, and now I just...
I feel more alive.
It works for you.
You look happy.
Mm.
You look happy too.
Hans?
Hey.
Are you okay?
My fever has spiked.
102 degrees.
I didn't see that twist coming, but I did know Jazwick wasn't dead.
I can't believe that I'm trusting you.
I gave you my word.
Okay.
So remember when Gompho discovered the mystery herbs?
Right.
You mean Ocimum discovered them.
The herbalist.
Oh, I...
I mixed them up.
That's so odd.
Actually, sit down for a minute.
I should recheck your blood pressure.
Something wrong?
I'm putting myself into the world of my story.
It's not easy with you here.
I-I don't usually bring people in with me when I write.
Well, I wish I were more of a creative type, so I could keep up.
I don't think of it as creating.
I just follow the characters where they lead me.
I know it sounds strange to say about a fantasy kingdom, but it's very real to me.
I developed a virosome.
What's that?
It's a synthetic vector that combines the carrying capacity and immune advantages of plasmids with the specificity and efficiency of a virus.
And that's what it felt like to me.
I-I followed the data and saw where it led me... from the security of my lab, but I also find good things when I venture out into other worlds.
Um, uh, so... when Oon proposes,
- Astaria says yes.
- Right.
Oh, no, but, uh, he's evil and her brother.
Oh, I...
I don't know why I keep...
You all right?
- Oh.
- Oh.
200 over 130.
That's too high.
Easy.
911.
This is Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.
I have a patient in hypertensive crisis.
- What's your address?
- 40 Timber Lane.
- We're on our way.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna give you Labetalol to temporize your BP.
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
That's good.
He said the Tylenol you gave him helped his fever, but his eye is really swollen.
Okay, um, put him on speaker.
Hans, are you feeling nauseous at all?
No.
But we all know that eye swelling is a late-stage Ebola symptom.
Hey, let's wait for the test results before you start talking like that.
Yeah, Jill's right.
Why would you have a late-stage symptom before any of the early ones?
Hey.
Dr. Roseman just showed up for the evening shift, which means you're free.
Okay, good, good.
I wanna get a closer look at Hans' eye.
All right, I'll help with the PPE.
I just...
I can't figure out why it would only be one eye.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Hans, does your eye feel warm?
My whole face feels warm.
Okay, have you ever had a blowout fracture?
Yes.
Okay, I'm going in.
Whoa, you gotta get in your gear.
He has an infection that's clearly getting worse.
Okay, we have to start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics now, or he could go septic and die while we wait for the Ebola test.
Henry, you go in there without gear, you're quarantined too.
Henry.
So your eye swelling is unilateral, and you haven't had any nausea or vomiting?
When I was 12, I hit my face on the ice and broke the floor of my eye socket.
I was saving my little brother when he fell through.
Of course you were.
And they put in a metal plate?
Yes.
I think your strep throat bacteria spread to the plate, which is acting as a nidus for the bacteria to lodge and multiply.
Bacterial biofilms on the implant.
Exactly.
I hope you're right.
Well, let's prove I am.
Okay, I'm just gonna give you some numbing drops.
Okay, good.
And here we go.
Yep.
Sure looks like an infection.
Let's check it out.
Okay, I'm just gonna add some dye.
And now we just need...
Ah.
I guess I'll have to send it to the lab.
You're looking for a microscope?
Yeah.
A microscope app.
Never know when I'm unable to get to a lab.
I am definitely getting one of those.
Okay.
Yep, there it is.
Guys?
There are white cells and bacteria in the fluid, which confirms infection.
That's why he has a fever.
- Boys, come on, please.
- Hey.
Give it back.
Hey, guys.
How are you?
I'm Evan.
I'm the hospital administrator.
That means boss.
I'm Wes.
This is Ian.
- Hello.
- Hi.
That makes you Lena, right?
So there's a guy refilling the vending machine at the end of the hall.
If you drop my name,
Evan R. Lawson, he'll give you a freebie.
Then you and I could talk.
Go ahead, guys.
- Yes!
- Evan R. Lawson.
Don't forget the R!
So your doctor tells me you're checking out against medical advice?
Yeah, because this stupid hospital, which I guess means you, decided to send a social worker to my house.
Right.
We were just worried about your brothers.
They were at the neighbors', but now there's gonna be a child services investigation and a hearing, so thank you very much for messing up our lives.
So your aunt is away?
When's she coming home?
Tomorrow.
I don't believe you.
Now I'm a liar.
No, you're a survivor.
I know 'cause I used to be one too.
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.
I lost my mom when I was, uh,
I guess a little younger than you.
This is after my dad bailed, so then it was just me and my brother.
We bounced around, but mostly we just had each other.
Does that sound familiar?
Just because you had to take care of your little brother doesn't mean you know anything...
No.
He had to take care of me.
I was the little brother.
So I know how much your brothers need you.
You can't really be there for them if you don't get well.
So... can they stay at the neighbors' for a couple more days?
Can you call off the investigation?
No, but I can be on your side.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Your blood pressure is stabilized.
Um, but your lab results show high sugar and low potassium.
So I ran your cortisol levels, and they confirm Cushing's disease.
What is that?
Uh, an adenoma on your pituitary gland is causing it to release too much ACTH, which stimulates cortisol production.
Your headaches, weakness, bone loss, confusion, high blood pressure were all caused by too much cortisol.
Will I be okay?
After a transsphenoidal adenomectomy, yes.
I love those words, but the only one I understood was "yes."
Um, surgeons will remove the adenoma, through your nose, actually, which is minimally invasive.
You'll be back to work in a couple days.
And until your wrist heals, you can count on me as your stenographer.
Oh, thank you.
My editor thanks you too.
Speaking of Zall, I had a thought.
If I could get you out of the hospital for a few hours before the surgery, would you accompany me on a quest?
Yes, I assure you the crisis is under control.
Hold on for one second.
I told you there's no news story here, 'cause there was never a crisis.
It...
I'll call you back.
Don't worry, I'm not contagious.
Hans' Ebola test came back negative.
And his CT proved that he had strep bacteria on the metal plate in his face.
He'll be okay.
Thanks.
You're very welcome.
For the record though, I knew it.
I knew you would never be able to take directions from your little brother.
If Jill had told you to quarantine a patient, you would've done it.
You wouldn't have challenged her in front of the whole hospital.
It wasn't the whole hospital.
Besides, I was right about Hans.
Yeah, but you didn't know you were right.
I mean, what if it had been Ebola and not just face strep?
Have you even thought about that?
Regardless, at least at HankMed, you dismissed me in private, Henry.
Maybe I dismissed some of your crazy ideas, but I...
Crazy ideas?
Oh, my God.
Crazy ideas?
Crazy ideas that built a successful business, is that what you were gonna say?
Not that you even noticed, actually, because apparently you thought I was just a bookkeeper, since that's all you replaced me with.
Just so you understand,
I was the CEO, CFO, community outreach director, media director, and head of sales.
That's five things.
You replaced me with one thing.
Well, I'm one thing.
I'm a doctor.
So you probably should've talked to me before you ordered a medically unnecessary quarantine in the middle of the ER that I was trying to run, just to help you out.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a conversation.
And I'm in the middle of an important job.
Evan R. Lawson.
Yeah, no, I got plenty of time to talk.
What's up?
Wait a minute, what?
Oh, my God.
Well, I thought the muffin selection in the cafeteria was pretty good.
I don't know who authorized that.
- Okay.
- Well, Cloris...
No, no, no, Cloris, absolutely.
Muffins are by far the most important thing
I have going on right now, so...
- Okay, give it.
- No, I'm not gonna...
- Give it.
- Stop it.
Then hang up, so we can talk.
- No.
- Give it to me!
- Give me your phone!
- Oh, my...
Henry, are you really doing this?
- I'm really doing this!
- Hold on, Cloris!
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I have your leg.
Give it, give it, give it!
It's mine!
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Ev.
Ev!
Hmm, yeah, it hurts.
Yep, you definitely scratched your cornea.
You mean you scratched my cornea.
So I'll give you some drops, and you'll have to wear an eye patch for a few days.
Like a pirate?
My staff's gonna have a field day.
You know, technically you're not adhering to the call panel.
I mean, you should really be waiting for ophthalmology.
Oh, so now you wanna start following protocol?
Well, I don't want to upset the administrator.
Oh, my... you know what?
This whole...
All right, look, look, look.
You were right.
I shouldn't have questioned your authority.
But for the record...
I didn't replace you with a bookkeeper.
I hired one because I didn't want anyone else to be HankMed's CFO, and I kinda hoped that once you'd settled into your job here, you'd have more time for HankMed.
Right.
So you could keep belittling me, right?
No.
Because I miss you.
Huh?
I miss you.
It's strange not having you there every day.
And I know sometimes we argue, like today, but...
I don't know, that's us, and I just... miss us.
I miss us too.
All right, it's eye patch time.
This is great.
It's gonna be a good look for you.
Just hold that in place.
- Huh.
- What?
What?
Just, um, open wide.
My... my mouth?
Your mouth.
Open wide and say,
"Ahh..."
- Ahh...
"Arrr, matey!"
I hate you.
Yeah, I hate you too.
Your roots are showing.
Tree puns.
Clever.
It doesn't look that busy.
Well, the website did say that the panel would be at the back of the...
Wow.
They're all here for my books?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
That's too many people.
Ugh, maybe we should go.
I...
I...
I can read about the panel online.
Astaria, we are on a quest.
Don't worry, we'll blend right in.
Just have to act like a couple of nerds.
I think we can do that.
Hey, thank you for your help with Lena.
Yeah.
Hopefully the social services investigation will light a fire under her aunt, but, uh, Lena's not too happy about it.
You did what you had to do.
Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Aw, I really wish we didn't have to catch this flight tonight.
It wasn't much of a reunion with the quarantine and all.
Yeah, sorry about that, even though I'd order it all over again.
- Oh, God, really?
- No doubt.
Totally understand, Evan.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
And, Hank, thank you for everything.
Of course.
It was great to meet you, Hans.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Evan, I think you are doing a great job with my old job.
- Really?
- Yes.
Thank you so much, Jill.
Big shoes to fill.
Divya, I want pictures of the new baby
- and more pictures of Sashi and...
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, the whole family, just keep 'em coming, okay?
- Promise?
- Promise.
Oh, you're gonna be a fantastic doctor.
Come back soon, please.
Yeah.
Ah.
- It was so good to see you.
- You too.
I feel like we barely had a chance to talk.
I know.
- Maybe...
- Jill!
- Good-bye, Jill.
- Good-bye, Hank.
Well, she found a great guy.
Huh?
Hans.
Oh, God, you thought that...
What?
What?
Oh, Hank, Hans is gay.
- He is?
- Yeah.
- So they're not...
- No.
We really need to get Hank on Facebook.
Or what, are you gonna make him walk the plank?
Yeah.

Help!
Anybody!
Tonight's top story, the notorious serial killer, Edward Wojowski's gruesome reign of terror over the city of Pittsburgh came to an end today with the escape of one of his would-be victims from an abandoned steel mill.
Unconfirmed police reports indicate that the killer, popularly referred to as The Survivalist, was killed by an unidentified female when she escaped, despite severe injuries, to South Side Hospital.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Well, I've looked at your x-rays and the CT scan.
There is some ligament damage to your knee.
It's gonna require therapy and a bit of time to completely mend.
Your eye on the other hand, well, there's been some damage.
Best thing we can do is leave this bandage on for the next week, let nature run its course.
I'm afraid you're not gonna get all of your vision back, but there will be some improvement.
Thanks.
My most pressing concern right now, is for your state of mental well-being.
A traumatic event like this, it's gonna be difficult for you to get over.
This is the number of a friend of mine.
He can help you get through this.
Give him a call.
He's a good guy.
But like your eye, it's gonna take some time.
(panting)
No, no, no, no.
No!
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no no no no, no, no no no no.
No.
(sobs)
(thud)
(camera bleeps)
(man clears his throat)
This is, uh--
Monday, May 5th.
This is the interview with Penelope Warren, by detective Jake Mosser, relating to the events of April 29th to May 2nd.
Can I get you a water, coffee, something like that, Miss Warren?
No, no I'm fine, thank you.
I'll try to make this as brief as possible, Penelope.
Um, well, Penny.
You can just call me Penny, I mean, everyone does.
Well--
(sighs)
Everyone did.
Okay then.
Penny, uh--
I'd like you to take a look at this photo, if you will.
Can you tell me, uh, who that is?
Um--
Yeah, that's him, that's the--
That's the man that murdered, and killed all my friends, and that killed my fiance.
The man I killed with an ax.
Let the record show that Miss Warren has identified Edward Wojowski, also known as The Survivalist, as her assailant.
(camera bleeps)
Well, uh--
I think that's all we're gonna need from you, uh, today.
There'll be a hearing regarding the murder of Wojowski.
I don't expect that you'll be needed for that.
Uh--
Given the circumstances, I don't believe that anyone would think that you acted, uh, in any way other than your own self-defense.
So I hope that now you can start to get past this and, uh, move on with your life.
How?
I beg your pardon?
How exactly am I supposed to move on with my life?
All my friends are dead.
My fiance is dead.
They were butchered by that--
That maniac.
[Jake sighs]
Penny, uh, I look at you and, I can see it.
You're a survivor.
[Penny chuckles]
Apparently so.
(somber music)
No, no.
No!
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
(dark atmospheric music)
No no, no no no no.
No.
(sobs)
Tell me what you see, Penny.
He's--
He's tall.
And he's angry.
It's hard, I can't--
I--
There's so much blood in my eyes, I can't see.
He has a knife.
I--
I think he knows where I am.
What, what are you doing?
Nothing.
I, I'm too scared to move.
(sighs)
It's, it's so cold.
I'm so hungry and my eye, my eye hurts so bad.
You're vulnerable right now.
Okay, let's talk.
The effects of an experience like this continues to undermine your own confidence, Penny.
The violation you sustained at the hands of Mr. Wojowski, well, this is something that we'll surely be dealing with for quite some time.
But in the end, we'll be able to overcome it together.
All right?
[Penny sighs]
Whatever you say.
Okay, good.
Now will I be able to see you again, Friday?
Okay.
Thanks, doctor.
Okay.
(dark atmospheric music)
(groans)
(grunts)
(friend whines)
(grunts)
(friend whines)
No!
No!
(friend groans)
(sobs)
(dark atmospheric music)
(pants)
(spraying water)
(music intensifies)
(groans)
Are we having more nightmares?
Oh, yeah.
You know--
I thought they'd be getting better by now.
Well, these things take time.
I'll give you a prescription, something to help you sleep.
Yeah, thanks.
I mean, I think the hardest thing that you're facing right now is how to reinsert yourself into your old life, Penny.
My old life is gone, Dr. Lentz.
I mean, there must be something, surely.
Have you tried going back to work, uh, what is it exactly that you do again?
Um--

An entertainer.
Well maybe that's the medicine that we need.
[Alicia] We're told today, the remains of Edward Wojowski were laid to rest in an unmarked grave.
Potters Field will be the final resting place of the man who terrorized the one and a half million residents of the greater Pittsburgh area.
But the question on the minds of the relieved people of this city is, who is this woman who stopped the bloody trail of death and suffering that The Survivalist blazed?
Sources say the woman is in her mid-20s, a local model and dancer.
Little more is known about this woman some Pittsburghers are calling a hero, but rest assured, WPXX will continue searching for answers.
This is Alicia Hayes reporting.

So tell me what you see.
I--
I can see the light.
I can see it a little.
But--
Okay.
I'm sorry, Penny, there was just too much damage to the cornea and your iris.
So then, that's it?
Well, look at this way, you still have excellent vision in your other eye.
It's important to look at positive things at a time like this.
Yeah.
Positive.
Like, we can get rid of that crutch and give you a knee brace.
Great!
Thank you.
So how's it going with Dr. Lentz?
(Chuckles) Well, you know.
It's going.
(light atmospheric music)
(smashing glass)
(grunts)
(sobs)
(groans)
(knocking)
(knocking)
Penny Warren?
Yeah?
Hi, I'm Alicia Hayes, WPXX News?
(Chuckles) I'm not interested in giving any interviews.
Look, I was just wondering if we could--
No, no, no, I'm not.
No, no interviews, just watch your hand.
I'm just gonna leave my card here for you, Penny!
Just in case you want someone to talk to!
(Chuckles) Lady, I have enough people that I have to talk to as it is.
I can't drive.
I can't work.
I can't, I can't even make a sandwich.
Fuck.
I don't have enough money to pay for physical therapy for my leg.
I don't even have enough money to pay you, doctor.
Edward Wojowski squatted in the steel mill, and you know, he had no family.
It's not like I can sue his estate or anything, can I?
There's just, everything is just now, it's just me.
I'm just, alone.
You're angry.
Well I'm glad all that money towards your college degree didn't go wasted, doc, 'cause you're fuckin' right I'm angry.
That bastard took everything from me!
He took everything!
He took my vision, he took my leg.
He took the--
He took the only man that I ever loved!
(sobs)
God.
And you know what, doctor, you know what?
Why, why did he leave me?
Why didn't he kill me?
'Cause this life wasn't meant for me.
I wasn't supposed to deal with all this shit 'cause my life wasn't this shit.
Fuck.
You should feel free to let it out.
This is a safe place.
Safe?
Yeah, hm.
I thought my house was a safe place, doctor.
I thought the woods was a safe place.
You know what?
Safety, there is no such thing as a safe place, I mean, safety is just, it's just an illusion.
What I'm gonna do is prescribe you something a little bit more powerful, a more powerful dosage.
You need time, you need time to heal yourself, to heal your psyche.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Shit!
Hello, Penny.
Oh god, lady, do you not get the hint?
Well if I did, then I wouldn't be very good at my job now, would I?
Hey, I just wanted--
Jesus.
Don't fuckin' touch me.
Now you listen to me and you listen to me real fuckin' good, news lady, now is the time for you to start backing off.
Okay?
But people wanna know!
What?
What do they exactly wanna know?
Do they wanna know how it feels to have everybody that you care about butchered?
Or maybe they wanna know how it feels to have to go through the rest of your life looking like a fuckin' freak.
I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.
So maybe that should be a hint to you, to leave me the fuck alone.
I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.
(dark atmospheric music)
(screaming)
(grunts)
No, no no, no no.
(woman screaming)
(grunts)
(woman screams)
[Jake sighs]
So what do we got?
[Woman] Look familiar?
[Jake] Did you check her back?
Um, not yet, I wanted you to see her before I moved her.
No scrapes on the back of her ankles or her legs that I can see here.
What do you think?
Did you check to see if there's any defensive wounds on the arms or hands?
Nothin' even under her nails.
I know, I can't figure it out.
She let somebody do this?
It's happened the same way.
I mean, look at the body positioning.
Everything is the same as the last time.
And my question is, if that's not Wojowski, then who the hell are we dealing with here?
(knocking)
Coming.
Oh, Detective--
Mosser.
Mosser, sorry.
Um.
Come in, come in.
Thanks.
Um.
I was just, um--
Oh, do you want some coffee or something?
Sure, that'd be great, thanks.
[Penny] Just give me a second.
[Jake] This is a nice place.
So uh, how are you doing, Penny?
[Penny] The truth?
[Jake] Of course.
(microwave bleeping)
[Penny] Pretty fuckin' bad.
Well I'm sorry.
It's a hell of a thing.
You took a man's life, right or wrong, it changes you.
It changes you.
My first year as a detective.
Domestic disturbance.
You know, more police officers are injured on domestics than any other type of call?
No, I didn't know that.
What happened?
Well--
That's not important anymore.
People were in danger, I had a choice to make and I made it, simple as that.
I'd do it again if I had to.
Well, I think I'd do it again.
So, um--
Oh, I'm sorry, did you come--
Did you need anything from me?
I didn't know if I forgot to call you or, did you--
Penny, we found a girl's body, up in the woods on the hill this morning.
By the reservoir.
We haven't, uh, IDed the girl yet, but she was stripped naked and killed with a survival knife.
Just, um-- (static)
Just like-- (static)
Yeah, the trouble is, what's left of Edward Wojowski is in an urn in the Potters Field.
I know, I saw him cremated.
So what are you saying then?
We're just not sure.
There's been a lot of media coverage of these events.
Sometimes we get copycats.
People looking to grab a headline.
The other possibility is that Edward Wojowski was not working alone.
That he had some kind of a partner on the outside.
We just don't know.
(screaming)
Well there's--
There's, um--
I'm sorry, detective, I'm--
I'm not, I'm not feeling that well.
(retches)
(knocking)
Penny.
Penny, are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine, detective, I'm just not feeling that good.
Can I call someone for you?
There's no one left to call.
I'm sorry?
Um.
Nothing, can you just make sure that the door is locked on your way out?
I'll--
Can I call and check on your tomorrow?
I feel bad leaving you like this.
Okay, um, great, thanks.
Yeah, I'll talk to your tomorrow.
I'll--
You, uh, you take care.
(sighs)
(sighs)
Shit.
The city of Pittsburgh is breathing a sigh of relief this week knowing that one of its most dangerous denizens, Edward "The Survivalist" Wojowski, is dead.
This is the steel mill where Wojowski ate, slept and tortured his victims.
Now police are not letting any reporters into the building, but here at WPXX, we've gained exclusive information regarding the woman who some are referring to as the one who got away.
This is the home of Penny Warren, who would have been The Survivalist's ninth victim, before her daring escape last Tuesday during which she managed to kill her captor with an ax.
I attempted to interview Miss Warren the other day, but found her unwilling to talk about the recent events.
Evidently, this is a woman who is still dealing with the trauma from recent events.
And now, we have unconfirmed reports that another body has been found in the woods in Mount Oliver.
It's obvious that this is a story whose conclusion has yet to be decided.
Until then, we'll be working to keep you informed.
Alicia Hayes, WPXX News.
(dark electronic music)
You know, I really hate to see you withdrawn like this, Penny.
I don't know, doctor, I've been--
I think after all I've been through and, you know, all the killings and stuff, like, maybe, maybe it changed me, somehow.
Well, you are who you are and nothing can change that.
I don't know, I've been having these dreams, like, these awful dreams.
And my temper, I'm just so angry.
Well, well of course you're angry.
I mean, your life has been turned upside down, and as far as the rest, your body's adjusting to the medication and you know, these things take time and we will work them out.
You know, the world has a lot to offer, and I'm afraid that you're missing out on some of these things, and uh, despite what you think, you're a young and attractive woman and uh, I'm sure that there's something out there for you.

Hello?
Penny, it's Dr. Lentz.
Uh, you missed your appointment this morning, and I was wondering if uh, everything was okay.
I'm a little concerned.
No, doctor.
(chuckles)
Everything is most definitely, not all right.
Well, if you feel better about coming over here to see me, or I can come to see you--
I...
I think it's best if you just--
If you just stay away from me.
Well Penny, I could be there, like, in around 10 minutes if you want--
Goodbye, doctor.
(sighs)
(children chattering)
(dark atmospheric music)
Penny, you didn't answer my call last night.
How'd you know I was here, detective?
Please, call me Jake.
Okay.
How'd you know I was here, Jake?
Now, I don't want you to take this the wrong way.
Oh god, please don't tell me that you're following me.
Penny, I just wanted to be sure that you're okay.
After what I've been through?
You don't think I have enough reasons to be paranoid?
I just--
I did it because I was worried about you.
Whoever killed these girls--
I gotta go.
[Jake] Penny, wait.
(dark atmospheric music)
No, no.
Fuckin' get away from me!
(screams)
Let go of me!
Why me, Jake?
- Let me give you a ride home.
- No, no!
You answer me.
There is a maniac out there killing girls, and you're stalking me?
Look at me, I'm a mangled ex-stripper, with a gimp leg, I can't work.
I gotta ride god-damn public transportation on top of all of that, I got some major anger issues.
As you, might be able to tell.
(chuckles)
So, uh--
Is that a yes?
I know that reporter lady's been harassing you.
I'll see what I can do to get her to quit.
Good luck.
She's almost as tenacious as you.
You know, it seems like everybody is trying to help me, but--
The more they try--
I don't know.
I don't want anything from you, Penny.
I don't have an angle, really.
I just--
Just, just--
Want you to be okay.
There's something that you should see.
(moody electronic music)
What?
This is it.
What's it?
Where they buried his ashes.
(sighs)
It's over now, Penny.
Now you can...
Move on with your life.
I found out the victim's name.
Megan Shamonski.
Turns it she works at The Cricket.
Danced under the name Sunny St. Claire.
Stripper.
Well, it fits The Survivalist's profile.
Yeah, more than you know.
Guess who else worked at The Cricket.
Guess who knew Sunny.
Oh, shit.
Jake.
This Warren girl.
She's caught up in something that's far from being over and the fact that you're seeing her--
I'm just... (sighs) I'm looking out for her, Kim.
She's been through hell.
Everybody she knows is dead, she's--
She's all alone out there.
You understand that, right?
No.
I don't.
And what if she's more involved in this than either of us know?
What then?
I mean, god, she could be so messed up in the head she doesn't even know what she's doing anymore.
And what if she's acting out, everything that happened to her?
Well then, uh--
I guess I'd--
Be the first to know.
Won't I?
(dark atmospheric music)
Oh hey, how are you doing?
(sharp thud)
It was nice of your mom to let you borrow her car.
(chuckles)
Come on, I get 400 miles to the gallon in this thing.
I told you, I can't handle tequila.
(dark electronic music)
(sharp thud) (faint wheezing)
(Jake groans)
Fuck.
(dark atmospheric music)
I'm sorry.
I can't.
It's--
It's all right.
Fuck you, it's all right!
(Jake sighs)
I'm sorry.
Stay away from me, Jake.
Stay away from me or we'll both be sorry.
I mean it.
Go!
(car starts)
(phone ringing)
(crunching)
(knocking)
(knocking)

(dark atmospheric music)
(clattering)
(spraying water)
(clinking)
Obvious that Penny Warren knows more about this than has been revealed.
This reporter wonders why the police are just allowing a material witness to withhold such potentially valuable information.
Lieutenant Jake Mosser, the detective in charge of the ongoing investigation even contacted me earlier this week and pressured me to abandon WPXX's reporting on the subject.
More young people are dying, detective.
Instead of covering it up, you need to bring in this woman and do whatever it takes to find out what she knows about this new murder.
[Penny sighs]
(phone rings)
(phone rings)
Penny?
Did you watch the news tonight, Dr. Lentz?
Yes, I saw it but uh, you really shouldn't take much stock in what a TV reporter has to say.
You know they're just after--
No, um, I wanna know, do you think there's a part of me that died along with my friends?
The good part of me.
Penny, you have to realize that there's a lot of guilt that's associated with when someone survives an incident where others die.
You know that, don't you?
Bullshit!
Bullshit.
I don't want any of your psychological PhD opinion crap, okay?
I wanna, I wanna know if someone kills another person, if something inside of them breaks, that allows them to go and kill someone else again and again.
Penny, are you taking your medication?
Penny?
Penny?
Never mind.
Sorry I called you so late.
Penny?
Penny!
No, Steven, I think it's a perfectly worthwhile allocation of my time, actually.
Well I think it's a good idea because no one else is going after her, and if I can land this, I can scoop Channel 4 and WPPG.
Well tell Lou and the others that they're fucking pussies and they need to strap it on if they wanna play with the big kids, okay?
(dark atmospheric music) Okay.
Well I'm gonna go take a shower.
Yes, Steven, I'll be naked.
That's how people take showers, naked.
Freak.
(electric guitar solo)
(spraying water)
(pulsating dark tones)
You?
(dark electronic tones)
(somber atmospheric music)
(phone vibrating)
(suspenseful strings)
[Jake] Penny!
Penny, I know you're there.
Will you just answer on the phone?
Penny, something's happened, we need to talk.
(knocking)
Penny, Alicia Hayes was killed last night.
They're gonna make me bring you in if you don't talk to Detective Hatherton.
(muffled chatter)
Where's Detective Mosser?
Oh, he's not doing this interview, Miss Warren, I am.
God, okay.
You know what?
I really don't need to see that, I get it.
Look, Penny, you've been through a hell of an ordeal.
I get it, I do.
But there are people dying out there and they're people that you have crossed paths with and you have no alibi for either night.
So what I need from you, is a reason why I shouldn't think you're completely crazy, and that you're not responsible for all of this.
(suspenseful music)
Jesus.
All right, well.
So, am I under arrest?
Not technically, no, but you are a person of interest in an ongoing investigation.
[Penny sighs]
Okay then, well.
I'm out of here.
(phone rings)
Hatherton.
(strong winds)
(dark atmospheric music)
[Penny sobs]
You gotta suck it up, sister, or you'll never make it through all this shit.
Who's there?
I think you know.
Oh, god.
Just get out.
Leave me alone!
I think you know that's impossible.
I can't leave, because I'm a part of you.
No.
No, no, no you're not me.
You're--
You're not me, you're a lie!
No, Penny.
I'm the only real truth.
Open your eyes and you'll see, I'm the part of you that you can't face.
I'm the one that got you through all this blood and all the shit, and all the death.
Take my hand.
Why?
Why are you here?
I told you.
I'm here to free you.
Free me to do what?
To fulfill your destiny.
There's work to be done and I can't do it alone.
You've been suffering for weeks.
You must be exhausted.
Don't worry.
I know how to make the pain go away.
Yeah.
So do I.
Hello, Dr. Lentz.
Jesus Christ!
Penny, you scared me!
What are you doing here?
(dark atmospheric music)
You left your door unlocked.
That's a very dangerous thing to do, I mean, anybody could have came walkin' in here.
Well, at least I'm glad it's you, but what are you doing here?
I don't understand.
Did we have an appointment or something?
I don't, I don't get this.
You see, I have come to a point of, self-realization.
Penny, you need help.
That's right.
Everybody wants to help me.
Penny, this is not, this is not good.
Here.
Penny, you can't quit these cold turkey, they're too strong!
Without, you know, side-effects?
Headaches and nausea, and irritability and anxiety, oh I know.
- Trust me, I know.
- Penny, Penny, please.
Please.
I decided I needed my own life back.
I decided I needed to tell what was real and what wasn't.
[Lentz] Penny, I don't understand.
(thud) (groans)
(thud) (groans)
I can't believe it took me this long to figure.. out!
(thud and groans)
You and your fuckin' drugs!
You killed that reporter!
She had a big mouth.
She was putting everything together anyways.
She was gonna figure things out.
(thud) (groans)
Yeah.
And what did Sunny do to you?
Why did you kill her?
- Why did you kill any of them?
- Stop it.
I had to do it, I had to kill them.
They were putting things together like that bitch detective.
She had to learn how to mind her own fucking business.
(groans)
Please stop hitting me.
Why me?
Why me?
Tell me, why me?
After everything I've been through, why me!
(thud) (groans)
Stop it.
(groans) Please.
Give me some god-damn answers...
And maybe I'll think about it!
I will, will, just please, please stop fucking hurting me.
(groans)
(coughs)
I was Wojowski's doctor.
He came to me four years ago.
I tried to keep him off the books.
He was perfect for what I was trying to do.
He was like clay in my hands.
He had been abused his entire childhood, and--
I had always wondered what all that anger would be like in that powerful huge individual like him.
Would there be an outlet for it.
And you gave it to him.
You gave him my friends.
And me.
I needed to know.
Medicine needed to know.
What makes someone kill.
Is it a switch that you pull off and on?
Is it--
Is it something that can be controlled and I needed to know!
What made you kill, Penny?
What made someone like you take another man's life?
(grunts)
(sharp thud)
I killed Wojowski because I had to!
But you?
I'm gonna kill you because I want to.
[Lentz coughs]
Killing me...
Only proves that I was right.
Fine.
You were right.
(sharp thud)
(sharp thud)
(sharp thud)
(screaming)
(sharp thud)
(screaming)
(sharp thud)
(sharp thud) (screaming)
(dark atmospheric tones)
They're gonna be coming for me soon, because of what you did, you and that monster that you created.
(sighs) Whatever.
I guess we're gonna see how this all ends, huh?
(thud) (cracking)
(knocking)
Dr. Lentz!
Dr. Lentz, we need to speak with you, it's very important!
It's about a call you made to one of our detectives.
Detective Hatherton.
(knocking) Dr. Lentz!
Doctor--
(dark electronic music)
Is there anybody here?
If there's anybody here, show yourself right now!
Damnit, Penny.
(sighs)
(dark atmospheric music)
(screaming) (thud)
(grunts) (thud)
(grunts) (thud)
Kim?
Fuck.
Jake.
What have you done?
Do it.
Go on.
Shoot me.
Blow me straight to hell.
You honestly think I give a shit anymore?
Why?
Why her?
I didn't kill her.
I found her like that whenever I got here.
And the doctor?
It was him.
He was your copycat.
It was him right from the beginning.
Just the puppet-master pulling all the strings.
I checked his cell phone records.
There were dozens of calls made to a prepaid cell phone purchased by him with his credit card.
Most of them around the time that you and your friends--
Yeah, he was training Wojowski, right from the beginning.
Just pushing him over the edge, just a little bit to unleash that killer that was inside of him.
He did the same thing to me.
I killed everybody I cared about.
(sighs) And anybody that got in the way.
Like Sunny and that reporter.
And Kim?
He wanted to see just how much I could take until I just went right over the edge.
Well I guess he found out.
I guess he did.
Then why not come to me for help?
Penny, why did you bring me back here, to this?
This is where it all began for me.
If Lentz was right...
Then whatever it was inside of me, that just woke up whenever I killed Wojowski--
It's not gonna end, it's never gonna end.
And--
(sighs)
Those dreams.
The dreams are just getting more and more vivid, and more and more frequent.
You didn't kill Sunny, and that reporter.
Penny, I believe that.
Well, maybe I didn't.
But I wanted to.
I could actually see myself doing it.
And if that's the way the rest of my life is gonna be, then I don't even wanna live.
No.
What Lentz started, is gonna finish...
Right here, and now.
(thud) (groans)
(suspenseful atmospheric music)
(music intensifies)
You know, they made so many of these in the 80s.
I was a little too young to remember but I checked.
Turns out that you can buy a bunch of 'em on the internet next to nothing.
I don't know if it was Wojowski or if it was Lentz that chose it, but, whoever it was did a good job.
Just all sorts of goodies that you can just store in here.
Whatever you're planning on doing, don't.
We can go to the prosecutor about--
About Lentz.
(sighs)
With all that you've been through, I'm sure that we can work something out.
[Penny sighs]
I'm sorry, Jake.
I really am.
You know this game, right?
You run and I chase.
If Lentz was right, then I kill you.
If not, you get away and you bring back a posse to come and get me.
Either way,...
This is gonna end today.
Go.
(dark atmospheric music)
(rattling)
(music intensifies)
[Jake chokes]
[Penny grunts]
(thud)
[Jake coughs and gasps]
(thud)
[Jake gasps and chokes]
Stay there!
Don't move.
Penny.
This isn't you.
(coughs)
(eerie music)
Stop acting like you know me, Jake!
You don't know me, you don't know the real me!
There's something behind these eyes that are just screaming!
And it wants to kill everything!
Penny.
It's not-- (coughs)
It's not you, it's, it's everything that's happened to you.
It's Lentz and all his bullshit theories.
The real you can choose who you wanna be.
I know that you know I've--
I've come to care about you a great deal.
Shut up!
[Jake groans]
There isn't enough going on that I gotta worry about some detective having a schoolboy crush on me.
Come on!
I'm just trying to help you remember the girl you were before all this happened to you.
[Penny mumbles to herself]
No.
No.
No, there's no going back.
Not for me.
Well--
Then I guess-- (coughs)
You're gonna have to kill me then.
I guess so.
And, if you kill me, that means--
Oh, this thing, that's inside you, that means that is who you really are.
No.
No more mind games, no more nothing.
This all ends.
[Jake coughs]
I'm, I'm sorry, Jake.
Yeah.
(coughs)
Me too.
(thud) (dramatic music)
(thud) (groans)
Damnit.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Just make it quick.
Come on, Penny.
[Penny] What the fuck are you doing?
I told you.
I just, wanted to help you.
[Penny] Well you can't, can you?
(somber atmospheric music)
(sobs)
Mosser!
There is no way on earth I'm gonna let you interrogate that woman.
Yeah, you and the DA try and stop me.
Chief will have your badge for this.

Help!
Anybody!
Tonight's top story, the notorious serial killer, Edward Wojowski's gruesome reign of terror over the city of Pittsburgh came to an end today with the escape of one of his would-be victims from an abandoned steel mill.
Unconfirmed police reports indicate that the killer, popularly referred to as The Survivalist, was killed by an unidentified female when she escaped, despite severe injuries, to South Side Hospital.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Well, I've looked at your x-rays and the CT scan.
There is some ligament damage to your knee.
It's gonna require therapy and a bit of time to completely mend.
Your eye on the other hand, well, there's been some damage.
Best thing we can do is leave this bandage on for the next week, let nature run its course.
I'm afraid you're not gonna get all of your vision back, but there will be some improvement.
Thanks.
My most pressing concern right now, is for your state of mental well-being.
A traumatic event like this, it's gonna be difficult for you to get over.
This is the number of a friend of mine.
He can help you get through this.
Give him a call.
He's a good guy.
But like your eye, it's gonna take some time.
No, no, no, no.
No!
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no no no no, no, no no no no.
No.
This is, uh--
Monday, May 5th.
This is the interview with Penelope Warren, by detective Jake Mosser, relating to the events of April 29th to May 2nd.
Can I get you a water, coffee, something like that, Miss Warren?
No, no I'm fine, thank you.
I'll try to make this as brief as possible, Penelope.
Um, well, Penny.
You can just call me Penny, I mean, everyone does.
Well--
Everyone did.
Okay then.
Penny, uh--
I'd like you to take a look at this photo, if you will.
Can you tell me, uh, who that is?
Um--
Yeah, that's him, that's the--
That's the man that murdered, and killed all my friends, and that killed my fiance.
The man I killed with an ax.
Let the record show that Miss Warren has identified Edward Wojowski, also known as The Survivalist, as her assailant.
Well, uh--
I think that's all we're gonna need from you, uh, today.
There'll be a hearing regarding the murder of Wojowski.
I don't expect that you'll be needed for that.
Uh--
Given the circumstances, I don't believe that anyone would think that you acted, uh, in any way other than your own self-defense.
So I hope that now you can start to get past this and, uh, move on with your life.
How?
I beg your pardon?
How exactly am I supposed to move on with my life?
All my friends are dead.
My fiance is dead.
They were butchered by that--
That maniac.
Penny, uh, I look at you and, I can see it.
You're a survivor.
Apparently so.
No, no.
No!
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No no, no no no no.
No.
Tell me what you see, Penny.
He's--
He's tall.
And he's angry.
It's hard, I can't--
I--
There's so much blood in my eyes, I can't see.
He has a knife.
I--
I think he knows where I am.
What, what are you doing?
Nothing.
I, I'm too scared to move.
It's, it's so cold.
I'm so hungry and my eye, my eye hurts so bad.
You're vulnerable right now.
Okay, let's talk.
The effects of an experience like this continues to undermine your own confidence, Penny.
The violation you sustained at the hands of Mr. Wojowski, well, this is something that we'll surely be dealing with for quite some time.
But in the end, we'll be able to overcome it together.
All right?
Whatever you say.
Okay, good.
Now will I be able to see you again, Friday?
Okay.
Thanks, doctor.
Okay.
No!
No!
Are we having more nightmares?
Oh, yeah.
You know--
I thought they'd be getting better by now.
Well, these things take time.
I'll give you a prescription, something to help you sleep.
Yeah, thanks.
I mean, I think the hardest thing that you're facing right now is how to reinsert yourself into your old life, Penny.
My old life is gone, Dr. Lentz.
I mean, there must be something, surely.
Have you tried going back to work, uh, what is it exactly that you do again?
Um--

An entertainer.
Well maybe that's the medicine that we need.
We're told today, the remains of Edward Wojowski were laid to rest in an unmarked grave.
Potters Field will be the final resting place of the man who terrorized the one and a half million residents of the greater Pittsburgh area.
But the question on the minds of the relieved people of this city is, who is this woman who stopped the bloody trail of death and suffering that The Survivalist blazed?
Sources say the woman is in her mid-20s, a local model and dancer.
Little more is known about this woman some Pittsburghers are calling a hero, but rest assured, WPXX will continue searching for answers.

I'm sorry, Penny, there was just too much damage to the cornea and your iris.
So then, that's it?
Well, look at this way, you still have excellent vision in your other eye.
It's important to look at positive things at a time like this.
Yeah.
Positive.
Like, we can get rid of that crutch and give you a knee brace.
Great!
Thank you.
So how's it going with Dr. Lentz?
Well, you know.
It's going.
Penny Warren?
Yeah?
Hi, I'm Alicia Hayes, WPXX News?
I'm not interested in giving any interviews.
Look, I was just wondering if we could--
No, no, no, I'm not.
No, no interviews, just watch your hand.
I'm just gonna leave my card here for you, Penny!
Just in case you want someone to talk to!
Lady, I have enough people that I have to talk to as it is.
I can't drive.
I can't work.
I can't, I can't even make a sandwich.
Fuck.
I don't have enough money to pay for physical therapy for my leg.
I don't even have enough money to pay you, doctor.
Edward Wojowski squatted in the steel mill, and you know, he had no family.
It's not like I can sue his estate or anything, can I?
There's just, everything is just now, it's just me.
I'm just, alone.
You're angry.
Well I'm glad all that money towards your college degree didn't go wasted, doc, 'cause you're fuckin' right I'm angry.
That bastard took everything from me!
He took everything!
He took my vision, he took my leg.
He took the--
He took the only man that I ever loved!
God.
And you know what, doctor, you know what?
Why, why did he leave me?
Why didn't he kill me?
'Cause this life wasn't meant for me.
I wasn't supposed to deal with all this shit 'cause my life wasn't this shit.
Fuck.
You should feel free to let it out.
This is a safe place.
Safe?
Yeah, hm.
I thought my house was a safe place, doctor.
I thought the woods was a safe place.
You know what?
Safety, there is no such thing as a safe place, I mean, safety is just, it's just an illusion.
What I'm gonna do is prescribe you something a little bit more powerful, a more powerful dosage.
You need time, you need time to heal yourself, to heal your psyche.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Shit!
Hello, Penny.
Oh god, lady, do you not get the hint?
Well if I did, then I wouldn't be very good at my job now, would I?
Hey, I just wanted--
Jesus.
Don't fuckin' touch me.
Now you listen to me and you listen to me real fuckin' good, news lady, now is the time for you to start backing off.
Okay?
But people wanna know!
What?
What do they exactly wanna know?
Do they wanna know how it feels to have everybody that you care about butchered?
Or maybe they wanna know how it feels to have to go through the rest of your life looking like a fuckin' freak.
I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.
So maybe that should be a hint to you, to leave me the fuck alone.
I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.
No, no no, no no.
So what do we got?
Look familiar?
Did you check her back?
Um, not yet, I wanted you to see her before I moved her.
No scrapes on the back of her ankles or her legs that I can see here.
What do you think?
Did you check to see if there's any defensive wounds on the arms or hands?
Nothin' even under her nails.
I know, I can't figure it out.
She let somebody do this?
It's happened the same way.
I mean, look at the body positioning.
Everything is the same as the last time.
And my question is, if that's not Wojowski, then who the hell are we dealing with here?
Coming.
Oh, Detective--
Mosser.
Mosser, sorry.
Um.
Come in, come in.
Thanks.
Um.
I was just, um--
Oh, do you want some coffee or something?
Sure, that'd be great, thanks.
Just give me a second.
This is a nice place.
So uh, how are you doing, Penny?
The truth?
Of course.
Pretty fuckin' bad.
Well I'm sorry.
It's a hell of a thing.
You took a man's life, right or wrong, it changes you.
It changes you.
My first year as a detective.
Domestic disturbance.
You know, more police officers are injured on domestics than any other type of call?
No, I didn't know that.
What happened?
Well--
That's not important anymore.
People were in danger, I had a choice to make and I made it, simple as that.
I'd do it again if I had to.
Well, I think I'd do it again.
So, um--
Oh, I'm sorry, did you come--
Did you need anything from me?
I didn't know if I forgot to call you or, did you--
Penny, we found a girl's body, up in the woods on the hill this morning.
By the reservoir.
We haven't, uh, IDed the girl yet, but she was stripped naked and killed with a survival knife.
Just, um--
Just like--
Yeah, the trouble is, what's left of Edward Wojowski is in an urn in the Potters Field.
I know, I saw him cremated.
So what are you saying then?
We're just not sure.
There's been a lot of media coverage of these events.
Sometimes we get copycats.
People looking to grab a headline.
The other possibility is that Edward Wojowski was not working alone.
That he had some kind of a partner on the outside.
We just don't know.
Well there's--
There's, um--
I'm sorry, detective, I'm--
I'm not, I'm not feeling that well.
Penny.
Penny, are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine, detective, I'm just not feeling that good.
Can I call someone for you?
There's no one left to call.
I'm sorry?
Um.
Nothing, can you just make sure that the door is locked on your way out?
I'll--
Can I call and check on your tomorrow?
I feel bad leaving you like this.
Okay, um, great, thanks.
Yeah, I'll talk to your tomorrow.
I'll--
You, uh, you take care.
Shit.
The city of Pittsburgh is breathing a sigh of relief this week knowing that one of its most dangerous denizens, Edward "The Survivalist" Wojowski, is dead.
This is the steel mill where Wojowski ate, slept and tortured his victims.
Now police are not letting any reporters into the building, but here at WPXX, we've gained exclusive information regarding the woman who some are referring to as the one who got away.
This is the home of Penny Warren, who would have been The Survivalist's ninth victim, before her daring escape last Tuesday during which she managed to kill her captor with an ax.
I attempted to interview Miss Warren the other day, but found her unwilling to talk about the recent events.
Evidently, this is a woman who is still dealing with the trauma from recent events.
And now, we have unconfirmed reports that another body has been found in the woods in Mount Oliver.
It's obvious that this is a story whose conclusion has yet to be decided.
Until then, we'll be working to keep you informed.
Alicia Hayes, WPXX News.
You know, I really hate to see you withdrawn like this, Penny.
I don't know, doctor, I've been--
I think after all I've been through and, you know, all the killings and stuff, like, maybe, maybe it changed me, somehow.
Well, you are who you are and nothing can change that.
I don't know, I've been having these dreams, like, these awful dreams.
And my temper, I'm just so angry.
Well, well of course you're angry.
I mean, your life has been turned upside down, and as far as the rest, your body's adjusting to the medication and you know, these things take time and we will work them out.
You know, the world has a lot to offer, and I'm afraid that you're missing out on some of these things, and uh, despite what you think, you're a young and attractive woman and uh, I'm sure that there's something out there for you.
Penny?
Penny?
Hello?
Penny, it's Dr. Lentz.
Uh, you missed your appointment this morning, and I was wondering if uh, everything was okay.
I'm a little concerned.
No, doctor.
Everything is most definitely, not all right.
Well, if you feel better about coming over here to see me, or I can come to see you--
I...
I think it's best if you just--
If you just stay away from me.
Well Penny, I could be there, like, in around 10 minutes if you want--
Goodbye, doctor.
Penny, you didn't answer my call last night.
How'd you know I was here, detective?
Please, call me Jake.
Okay.
How'd you know I was here, Jake?
Now, I don't want you to take this the wrong way.
Oh god, please don't tell me that you're following me.
Penny, I just wanted to be sure that you're okay.
After what I've been through?
You don't think I have enough reasons to be paranoid?
I just--
I did it because I was worried about you.
Whoever killed these girls--
I gotta go.
Penny, wait.
No, no.
Fuckin' get away from me!
Let go of me!
Why me, Jake?
- Let me give you a ride home.
- No, no!
You answer me.
There is a maniac out there killing girls, and you're stalking me?
Look at me, I'm a mangled ex-stripper, with a gimp leg, I can't work.
I gotta ride god-damn public transportation on top of all of that, I got some major anger issues.
As you, might be able to tell.
So, uh--
Is that a yes?
I know that reporter lady's been harassing you.
I'll see what I can do to get her to quit.
Good luck.
She's almost as tenacious as you.
You know, it seems like everybody is trying to help me, but--
The more they try--
I don't know.
I don't want anything from you, Penny.
I don't have an angle, really.
I just--
Just, just--
Want you to be okay.
There's something that you should see.
What?
This is it.
What's it?
Where they buried his ashes.
It's over now, Penny.
Now you can...
Move on with your life.
I found out the victim's name.
Megan Shamonski.
Turns it she works at The Cricket.
Danced under the name Sunny St. Claire.
Stripper.
Well, it fits The Survivalist's profile.
Yeah, more than you know.
Guess who else worked at The Cricket.
Guess who knew Sunny.
Oh, shit.
Jake.
This Warren girl.
She's caught up in something that's far from being over and the fact that you're seeing her--
I'm just...
I'm looking out for her, Kim.
She's been through hell.
Everybody she knows is dead, she's--
She's all alone out there.
You understand that, right?
No.
I don't.
And what if she's more involved in this than either of us know?
What then?
I mean, god, she could be so messed up in the head she doesn't even know what she's doing anymore.
And what if she's acting out, everything that happened to her?
Well then, uh--
I guess I'd--
Be the first to know.
Won't I?
Oh hey, how are you doing?
It was nice of your mom to let you borrow her car.
Come on, I get 400 miles to the gallon in this thing.
I told you, I can't handle tequila.
Fuck.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
It's--
It's all right.
Fuck you, it's all right!
I'm sorry.
Stay away from me, Jake.
Stay away from me or we'll both be sorry.
I mean it.
Go!
Obvious that Penny Warren knows more about this than has been revealed.
This reporter wonders why the police are just allowing a material witness to withhold such potentially valuable information.
Lieutenant Jake Mosser, the detective in charge of the ongoing investigation even contacted me earlier this week and pressured me to abandon WPXX's reporting on the subject.
More young people are dying, detective.
Instead of covering it up, you need to bring in this woman and do whatever it takes to find out what she knows about this new murder.
Penny?
Did you watch the news tonight, Dr. Lentz?
Yes, I saw it but uh, you really shouldn't take much stock in what a TV reporter has to say.
You know they're just after--
No, um, I wanna know, do you think there's a part of me that died along with my friends?
The good part of me.
Penny, you have to realize that there's a lot of guilt that's associated with when someone survives an incident where others die.
You know that, don't you?
Bullshit!
Bullshit.
I don't want any of your psychological PhD opinion crap, okay?
I wanna, I wanna know if someone kills another person, if something inside of them breaks, that allows them to go and kill someone else again and again.
Penny, are you taking your medication?
Penny?
Penny?
Never mind.
Sorry I called you so late.
Penny?
Penny!
No, Steven, I think it's a perfectly worthwhile allocation of my time, actually.
Well I think it's a good idea because no one else is going after her, and if I can land this, I can scoop Channel 4 and WPPG.
Well tell Lou and the others that they're fucking pussies and they need to strap it on if they wanna play with the big kids, okay?
Okay.
Well I'm gonna go take a shower.
Yes, Steven, I'll be naked.
That's how people take showers, naked.
Freak.
You?
Penny!
Penny, I know you're there.
Will you just answer on the phone?
Penny, something's happened, we need to talk.
Penny, Alicia Hayes was killed last night.
They're gonna make me bring you in if you don't talk to Detective Hatherton.
Where's Detective Mosser?
Oh, he's not doing this interview, Miss Warren, I am.
God, okay.
You know what?
I really don't need to see that, I get it.
Look, Penny, you've been through a hell of an ordeal.
I get it, I do.
But there are people dying out there and they're people that you have crossed paths with and you have no alibi for either night.
So what I need from you, is a reason why I shouldn't think you're completely crazy, and that you're not responsible for all of this.
Jesus.
All right, well.
So, am I under arrest?
Not technically, no, but you are a person of interest in an ongoing investigation.
Okay then, well.
I'm out of here.
Hatherton.
You gotta suck it up, sister, or you'll never make it through all this shit.
Who's there?
I think you know.
Oh, god.
Just get out.
Leave me alone!
I think you know that's impossible.
I can't leave, because I'm a part of you.
No.
No, no, no you're not me.
You're--
You're not me, you're a lie!
No, Penny.
I'm the only real truth.
Open your eyes and you'll see, I'm the part of you that you can't face.
I'm the one that got you through all this blood and all the shit, and all the death.
Take my hand.
Why?
Why are you here?
I told you.
I'm here to free you.
Free me to do what?
To fulfill your destiny.
There's work to be done and I can't do it alone.
You've been suffering for weeks.
You must be exhausted.
Don't worry.
I know how to make the pain go away.
Yeah.
So do I.
Hello, Dr. Lentz.
Jesus Christ!
Penny, you scared me!
What are you doing here?
You left your door unlocked.
That's a very dangerous thing to do, I mean, anybody could have came walkin' in here.
Well, at least I'm glad it's you, but what are you doing here?
I don't understand.
Did we have an appointment or something?
I don't, I don't get this.
You see, I have come to a point of, self-realization.
Penny, you need help.
That's right.
Everybody wants to help me.
Penny, this is not, this is not good.
Here.
Penny, you can't quit these cold turkey, they're too strong!
Without, you know, side-effects?
Headaches and nausea, and irritability and anxiety, oh I know.
- Trust me, I know.
- Penny, Penny, please.
Please.
I decided I needed my own life back.
I decided I needed to tell what was real and what wasn't.
Penny, I don't understand.
I can't believe it took me this long to figure.. out!
You and your fuckin' drugs!
You killed that reporter!
She had a big mouth.
She was putting everything together anyways.
She was gonna figure things out.
Yeah.
And what did Sunny do to you?
Why did you kill her?
- Why did you kill any of them?
- Stop it.
I had to do it, I had to kill them.
They were putting things together like that bitch detective.
She had to learn how to mind her own fucking business.
Please stop hitting me.
Why me?
Why me?
Tell me, why me?
After everything I've been through, why me!
Stop it.
Please.
Give me some god-damn answers...
And maybe I'll think about it!
I will, will, just please, please stop fucking hurting me.
I was Wojowski's doctor.
He came to me four years ago.
I tried to keep him off the books.
He was perfect for what I was trying to do.
He was like clay in my hands.
He had been abused his entire childhood, and--
I had always wondered what all that anger would be like in that powerful huge individual like him.
Would there be an outlet for it.
And you gave it to him.
You gave him my friends.
And me.
I needed to know.
Medicine needed to know.
What makes someone kill.
Is it a switch that you pull off and on?
Is it--
Is it something that can be controlled and I needed to know!
What made you kill, Penny?
What made someone like you take another man's life?
I killed Wojowski because I had to!
But you?
I'm gonna kill you because I want to.
Killing me...
Only proves that I was right.
Fine.
You were right.
They're gonna be coming for me soon, because of what you did, you and that monster that you created.
Whatever.
I guess we're gonna see how this all ends, huh?
Dr. Lentz!
Dr. Lentz, we need to speak with you, it's very important!
It's about a call you made to one of our detectives.
Detective Hatherton.
Dr. Lentz!
Doctor--
Is there anybody here?
If there's anybody here, show yourself right now!
Damnit, Penny.
Kim?
Fuck.
Jake.
What have you done?
Do it.
Go on.
Shoot me.
Blow me straight to hell.
You honestly think I give a shit anymore?
Why?
Why her?
I didn't kill her.
I found her like that whenever I got here.
And the doctor?
It was him.
He was your copycat.
It was him right from the beginning.
Just the puppet-master pulling all the strings.
I checked his cell phone records.
There were dozens of calls made to a prepaid cell phone purchased by him with his credit card.
Most of them around the time that you and your friends--
Yeah, he was training Wojowski, right from the beginning.
Just pushing him over the edge, just a little bit to unleash that killer that was inside of him.
He did the same thing to me.
I killed everybody I cared about.
And anybody that got in the way.
Like Sunny and that reporter.
And Kim?
He wanted to see just how much I could take until I just went right over the edge.
Well I guess he found out.
I guess he did.
Then why not come to me for help?
Penny, why did you bring me back here, to this?
This is where it all began for me.
If Lentz was right...
Then whatever it was inside of me, that just woke up whenever I killed Wojowski--
It's not gonna end, it's never gonna end.
And--
Those dreams.
The dreams are just getting more and more vivid, and more and more frequent.
You didn't kill Sunny, and that reporter.
Penny, I believe that.
Well, maybe I didn't.
But I wanted to.
I could actually see myself doing it.
And if that's the way the rest of my life is gonna be, then I don't even wanna live.
No.
What Lentz started, is gonna finish...
Right here, and now.
You know, they made so many of these in the 80s.
I was a little too young to remember but I checked.
Turns out that you can buy a bunch of 'em on the internet next to nothing.
I don't know if it was Wojowski or if it was Lentz that chose it, but, whoever it was did a good job.
Just all sorts of goodies that you can just store in here.
Whatever you're planning on doing, don't.
We can go to the prosecutor about--
About Lentz.
With all that you've been through, I'm sure that we can work something out.
I'm sorry, Jake.
I really am.
You know this game, right?
You run and I chase.
If Lentz was right, then I kill you.
If not, you get away and you bring back a posse to come and get me.
Either way,...
This is gonna end today.
Go.
Stay there!
Don't move.
Penny.
This isn't you.
Stop acting like you know me, Jake!
You don't know me, you don't know the real me!
There's something behind these eyes that are just screaming!
And it wants to kill everything!
Penny.
It's not--
It's not you, it's, it's everything that's happened to you.
It's Lentz and all his bullshit theories.
The real you can choose who you wanna be.
I know that you know I've--
I've come to care about you a great deal.
Shut up!
There isn't enough going on that I gotta worry about some detective having a schoolboy crush on me.
Come on!
I'm just trying to help you remember the girl you were before all this happened to you.
No.
No.
No, there's no going back.
Not for me.
Well--
Then I guess--
You're gonna have to kill me then.
I guess so.
And, if you kill me, that means--
Oh, this thing, that's inside you, that means that is who you really are.
No.
No more mind games, no more nothing.
This all ends.
I'm, I'm sorry, Jake.
Yeah.
Me too.
Damnit.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Just make it quick.
Come on, Penny.
What the fuck are you doing?
I told you.
I just, wanted to help you.
Well you can't, can you?
Mosser!
There is no way on earth I'm gonna let you interrogate that woman.
Yeah, you and the DA try and stop me.
Chief will have your badge for this.
♪ Terror, violent hatred ♪
'Do you know the name Alice Webster?
' 'She was abducted in spring 2003.'
'Yesterday, she came back.
Walked into the town square.'
What's happened to her, Sam?
Where the hell has she been?
There's a name she mentioned when the paramedics asked who they could call.
She said the name Sophie Giroux.
Sophie Giroux?
This is a Photofit of the man who took Alice and Sophie.
It will be in every newspaper by the evening edition.
I have over 5,000 men and women in this garrison ready to help.
'I need to find someone to drive me to Azwya.'
Across an active warzone.
That's a pretty good way to get yourself killed.
I must find this man
- Daniel Reed.
Henry Reed was a soldier, but a father first.
He leaves behind his son Daniel.
Do you ever feel like your family is slipping away from you?
I believe that girl was not Alice Webster.
Mrs Giroux.
Julien, leave me alone.
I promise you, I haven't given up on Sophie.
I won't give up until I find your daughter.
Do you believe that?
Mrs Giroux, however bad things seem now... it will get better.
♪ Oh, my love, we pray each day
♪ May you come home and be OK
♪ For now we wait for you
♪ For you to come home. ♪
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Did you sleep?
Not really.
It's strange, isn't it?
Having another set of footsteps in the house after all this time.
Yeah.
We used to be able to tell, didn't we, who was going past the bedroom, just by their footsteps.
She'd always take them two at a time, wouldn't she?
Always in such a rush.
I've thought about it so many times.
What it would be like, if she ever came back.
I suppose somehow I expected it would just be the same as before.
It's going to take a while before she's back to herself.
Before any of us are.
But, in time, we'll recognise those footsteps again.
I promise you.
Are you all right, my love?
Do you want me to...?
Would you like a cup of tea?
No.
No, thank you.
I just need to...
I've just got so many questions I want to ask, but I keep stopping myself.
You can ask me things, you know.
Well, I was...
I was just going to ask you how you slept, that's all.
I didn't.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Good morning.
What's going on?
My name is Julien Baptiste.
In 2002, a girl called Sophie Giroux was abducted in Paris and I investigated her case.
I have been informed your daughter Alice was held captive with her.
If I could speak with Alice...
We've only just got our daughter back.
She needs some time alone.
She's got people coming round today that she needs to talk to, so that's what's important.
I hope you understand...
Yes, of course, but there is a man just like you, whose daughter was taken from him.
Only this man continues to live with the uncertainty you must know so well.
That ever-present hope that today might be the day the telephone rings.
That somebody has called to say, "We've found her".
The man's name is Remy Giroux.
He's Sophie's father.
Please, let me talk to Alice.
You must be tired.
I know the last thing you feel like is answering more questions.
I'm just here to ask about Sophie Giroux.
I don't know what more I can say about her.
Why didn't she escape with you?
When I got ill, it happened so fast.
But Sophie...
She'd been ill for a while.
He kept her away from me, mostly.
In the dark.
Sometimes he wouldn't feed her for days on end because she'd talk back.
She argued with him and he hated that.
She could hardly talk or stand.
Then when I found the lock was open... ..I tried to help her to her feet, but she couldn't.
I promised that I would get help.
She didn't even have the energy to move when I left.
And the place you escaped from?
It was underground, I think.
But the light was so bright when I got out so I just ran.
Well, perhaps if you were to return to the woods, you might recall.
You might find the place you ran from.
In her state?
She's only just come out of the hospital and we have spoken to the police about this.
Sophie was your friend.
If she's still alive...
Look, I hate to say this, but whoever did this, he'd know that Alice is gone, so he would have moved the other girl already.
Now, what's important is for my daughter to get better, so...
Of course.
But if your abductor was in a hurry, perhaps he left something.
I don't know.
You must realise, Alice, you are the only one who can help us find your friend.
I don't know.
How long before you reached the road?
I've already been through this
All right, Mr Baptiste.
That's enough, now.
And I don't remember, OK?
It's time for you to leave, OK?
Oi, do you hear me?
Are you listening?
Yes.
Forgive me.
Thank you...
Alice.
Ja, ja.
Danke.
Danke.
Wiedersehen.
- Poor Agata.
- Mm.
There is something going round.
That's all.
She'll be fine.
I mean having to put up with that man as a husband.
You have to put up with me.
Size of a bloody auroch, that thing.
Ah!
Something you don't know!
They were a large breed of cattle, went extinct back in the 1600s, apparently.
Horns up to a metre long.
Aggressive bastards.
Goering tried to genetically engineer them back into existence during World War II.
Tried to turn them into a symbol of the party, apparently.
People do the strangest things.
You always surprise me.
Well, I... fell in love with a butcher.
I had to do my research.
Find some common ground before I came over and talked to him...
So... you were stalking me, hmm?
Trying to seduce me.
Maybe... a little bit.
So, what did you find?
I haven't figured it out yet.
Andreas?
Hello?
It's me, your loving husband.
How are you?
Do you remember when Sophie Giroux went missing?
Yeah.
How could I not?
There was this video...
Every time there was a report on the news, they would play this clip.
I had a copy of that video in with my case files, in the attic.
Would you send it to me?
Well, I could...
If I could find it...
But I'm sure it's online.
OK.
For your next birthday, I'm going to buy you a computer course.
Right...
There's bound to be some news reports from the time knocking around somewhere, it's going to be a lot easier than me trawling through that mess in the attic...
Ah!
Voila.
Voila quoi?
Here...
Check your e-mail.
Then click on the link.
So, how's it going out there?
We are just at the beginning.
I love you.
We're all set.
For only 500, you too can enter a warzone.
So the officer says there was a lot of fighting around al-Mazwaa yesterday.
He says if we stick to the north and follow this road, then we should be within areas controlled by the Peshmerga.
But right now, the larger villages to the south
- Hawija, Abbasi - are all being held by Isil.
It changes every second,
Isil are pushing north for more territory.
Look, I say we head straight for Azwya, no stopping, and if there's anything at all, anything that has us second-guessing ourselves, we turn back.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
And you're sure this guy...
Daniel Reed?
Yeah, Daniel Reed.
Is he worth it?
If we find Daniel Reed, we will find who took those girls.
It's a long story.
We have plenty of time.
But first... and foremost...
What is this?
Bhangra.
My wife got me into it, She's Punjabi.
It is very loud.
I'm sorry.
It's non-negotiable.
Do you have to rush off?
I've got the room all day.
And what a room
I'll let you book it next time.
We could come back tomorrow morning.
Gemma's at school...
Not that she asks where I'm going these days...
I know.
I don't want to talk about your family, Sam.
Any more than you want to hear me talk about the baby.
OK?
Thanks.
You write.
Please?
The guest book.
We insist...
Well, I haven't got a pen, so...
Ah, here.
Thank you... ..Mr Jones.
This is Azwya?
Should be.
It's quiet.
Yeah.
I saw a few of these last time I was in these parts.
Ghost villages.
Caught in the crossfire.
Wherever your boy Daniel Reed is,
I don't think he's here.
Not any more.
We have come this far.
We must look.
So if this girl wasn't Alice Webster, who was she?
I studied Sophie Giroux, for years and years.
There is a gesture she makes - a nervous habit.
This girl, Alice, made the same gesture.
So you think Alice was really Sophie?
Because of a gesture?
Such things are unconscious habits.
We do not know we do them.
When I saw this, I thought of photographs of the girls when they were taken.
Even at that age, they could have been sisters.
The abductor was looking for a specific physical type.
What about the accent?
Sophie's mother was English.
The girls spent almost half their lives with only each other for company.
Is it impossible they should become like one another?
And what?
Alice's parents, they...
They just accept it?
Have you never fooled yourself into believing something, just because you wanted it so much to be true?
Yeah, but I don't understand.
Why would anyone...
Why would anyone...
Shit!
That's an Isil flag.
Miss Stone, please...
I am sorry.
It is too hard.
He pushed me.
I cannot.
I understand.
Can you stay until I find another nurse?
Two weeks.
Thank you.
Dad?
Morning.
Watching this again?
This is the first film I ever saw.
I was just a boy.
My father took me to the cinema.
He had his arm in a sling at the time.
He'd broken it, so he took the day off work.
I remember when it started.
These figures, larger than life, appeared doing impossible, heroic things.
I couldn't take my eyes off that screen.
And when we left the cinema, I talked a thousand miles an hour about how brave the people were.
And he looked at me, at how entranced I was by it all, and he said,
"Son, how do you think I broke my arm?"
He told me he was there, in the movie and that I'd missed him in the background fighting alongside the others.
I made my daughter, Eve, watch it when she was a girl...
Dad...
It's me.
It's Eve.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
I know.
Engel.
Brigadier Stone...
Any luck with the Photofit?
It is with every major news outlet, in all the papers, and with every police department.
The media might be more interested if we could tell them what this man was wanted in connection with.
Miss Webster needs her privacy right now.
- Where are we with the search?
- The area is significant.
We have covered only a small part of the woods around the town.
Based on the girl's description, we are estimating at least...
Mrs Webster...?
Yes, of course.
But...
You're sure?
Right.
Thank you.
I'll call right back.
- ..into the forest...
- That was Gemma Webster.
Alice says she's ready to help us find the place she was kept.
Right, then, let's go.
Thank you for bringing me, Sergeant.
You don't have to do this, you know?
I mean, the psychologists are coming, you just need to get better.
Or take me or your mum with you.
You're going to need someone...
I don't want you to... be there.
Alice!
Alice, look what I found.
Right.
Yeah.
Don't you recognise it?
You made it for me.
Just before your 10th birthday.
Oh.
Yeah.
With your art teacher.
Miss Hammond.
Don't you mean Mrs Barker?
Oh, yeah.
My mistake.
Alice, are you ready?
We'll take good care of her.
It's quite some way from Eckhausen.
To walk that journey in the state she was in... ..it's not an easy task.
It's amazing what people can do when they're trying to just stay alive.
- You OK?
- It's from an old case.
There are good days and bad, you know.
And you?
I'm pregnant, not disabled.
I hear you went to see Alice, right before she called us.
What is it with you and the Giroux case?
I wonder - has anybody performed a DNA test on Alice Webster?
There was no need.
Her own parents identified her.
It's only standard procedure if you can't get an ID.
Perhaps if you asked her parents for something - a lock of hair maybe.
Just to be sure...
What's going on, Baptiste?
I spoke with Alice Webster.
There was something about her.
The girl is lying.
What would she have to lie about?
I can't be sure.
But...
It doesn't make sense.
She's picking up the pace.
Sam... ..does she seem...
..different to you?
Of course.
How could she not be after what she's been through?
But she'll get better.
Yeah, it's just...
When I gave her the scarf, she was...
What?
Nothing.
I thought when we had her back...
Well, it's all we've ever wanted, isn't it?
But now she's back... ..and the way she is now...
But she is back.
And that's all that matters, isn't it?
Pass auf, wir gehen gleich zusammen da runter.
What is this?
Looks like an old World War II bunker.
They're all over Germany.
No-one ever bothered to seal them off.
They must have missed it in the original search.
Must be hard.
It was brave of you to come back.
Sophie...
I knew her parents when she was taken.
It was a tragedy, what happened to her mother.
Julien!
Julien, they're coming up.
Excuse me.
There's somebody here.
I'll go.
Hello.
You're Henry Reed's son.
I'm sorry about your dad.
I saw you at the funeral.
That's why I'm here.
I'm speaking to everyone that knew him.
I didn't know him all that well.
They say he killed himself.
Only, he didn't have any reason to.
Me, if I was collecting my armed forces pension, that shitty amount for risking my life on behalf of some shirt in Whitehall... me, I'd be tempted.
But not my dad.
He was happy.
So I've been going through his stuff, trying to find something.
And... he kept a diary.
And you're in it.
Probably not the nicest account of me, I would imagine.
I...
I had a reputation.
Every day on ops, he'd write in this diary.
Every day, no exception.
Except when he fought in Iraq in 1991.
It just stops.
So, what happened?
Being in combat changes you.
You'll learn soon enough.
Don't patronise me.
You're all the same.
Officers.
You're a bunch of idiots.
You're in pain.
I understand.
But you can't talk to me like that, trooper.
You're not in the Army any more.
You don't give me orders.
Who was that?
It looks like no-one's been down here since it was built.
The girl says they were moved here, yes?
She says they were moved a few times over the years.
Basements, cellars...
And then, most recently, here, for... several months?
As best as she can remember.
It's not like she had any way of telling the time.
This abductor - he takes Sophie.
The following year, Alice Webster.
For 11 years he keeps them hidden from the world, and then... ..takes them to this place in the middle of a forest.
Why?
We'll find out when we catch the bastard.
We should turn back.
Julien.
Julien!
Julien.
Julien, we can turn back!
Julien!
Julien!
We are looking for someone.
We are not seeking trouble.
English?
You speak English?
The jihadists are gone.
Isil has fled for now.
The Peshmerga came and drove them out.
Who is it you are looking for?
His name is Daniel Reed.
The information I have says he was here a month or so ago.
I do not recognise him.
But perhaps someone else will.
Follow me.
I will show this photo around.
Isil did not scare us all away.
Thank you.
Because of the surface area of the burns,
I would suggest a split thickness skin graft.
It allows us to cover larger areas.
And because the same site can be harvested after six weeks, it's possible to do the surgery in stages.
How much is it?
Because of your situation, Mr Webster,
I would do the work for free.
The scarring would be minimal at first.
And, then, in time, you will not even be able to see it.
Back to the old me, then, eh?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What did the plastic surgeon say?
- Yeah, he said he can do it.
- Oh, great.
But we can't afford it.
I looked into it.
Just scars.
I'll live with it.
Matthew!
Matthew, I want to talk to you.
Matthew!
Well, no change there, then.
- Can't you talk to him?
- Me?
We can't just stop trying, Sam.
I haven't stopped trying.
He just doesn't care, does he?
I nearly lost my job because of him.
Now I'm stuck pushing papers around.
And for what?
So he can still hate me.
I'm going to go and work on the car.
You'll never get it going again.
Or is that the point?
Oh, don't get oil on your shirt again.
So, what do you think, then?
We should get back.
We'll be late.
Dad, you need to look around.
See if you like the place.
I...
I've seen it.
Now let's go home.
Dad, you're not even looking.
I know where I am, for Christ's sake.
I know what we're doing.
This is a place where you'll be looked after, Dad.
They'll be able to help you much better than I can.
These people gave their lives for their country and this is how we repay them?
Scrabble sets with half the pieces missing and a shared toilet?
This is what passes for the state taking care of those who took care of them?
Stopped them talking bloody Arabic?
It's not good enough!
Dad, this isn't a military hospital.
This is a place where...
Henry knows what I'm talking about.
Good old Henry Reed.
He's got his head screwed on.
He'll tell you.
Dad.
Come on.
Remarkable, is it not?
In front of all this, people still go about their business.
They adapt.
I guess it's the only way of taking control of your life, I suppose.
Feeling like your fate is in your own hands for a change.
I miss that feeling.
Is there really nothing they can do?
Well, they say... ..if I don't have it operated on, there is a chance I will die.
But if I have it operated on... ..there is a chance I will die.
So...
You see my problem.
But with all that going on, why here, now?
Many years ago, I was given a case - a missing girl.
Sophie Giroux.
I made a mistake.
The mother died.
The father, Remy Giroux, lost his entire family and I carry that guilt with me.
Always.
I once heard someone say that guilt is like a cancer - you can treat the symptoms, but never the cause.
Perhaps that's all I am doing.
Nah.
You're doing it for yourself.
Right?
I mean...
Detectives are just a bunch of nosy bastards with badges, right?
And journalists are the same, non?
Only, no badges...
We must leave.
Wait, what?
Right now.
What just happened?
What did you see?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
I think somebody is following me.
Twice, I have seen the same man - once in Kirkuk, at the bank, do you remember?
- And now again in the village.
- You're sure?
The same person followed you from Kirkuk all the way out here?
Well, maybe this explains why our hosts were so keen to keep us there.
Maybe they know exactly where Daniel Reed is.
Julien, you need to be honest with me.
Why are you being followed?
And what's all this got to do with Alice Webster and Sophie Giroux?
Look, look!
What's happening?
It's fine, they're Peshmerga.
What is he saying?
He wants to know how you know that man.
What is going on?
I have no idea.
But that photo means something to them.
What?
Whoa, whoa!
Hey.
Do you remember this?
Yeah.
We had the biggest fight over that.
Here you go, Midget.
Mine at last.
I want to ask you something.
I want you to...
I want you to do something for me.
OK.
I can't sleep.
I just feel like anyone could get in.
No-one's going to hurt you now, Alice.
What's in the shed?
I don't know.
Nothing much.
I want to sleep in the shed.
The floors here, they're...
They're too soft.
It's cold out there.
I want to sleep in the shed.
And I need you... to lock me in.
Is that what he did to you?
I haven't slept since I got here.
No, not like that.
I'm not locking you in like an animal.
I'm asking you to help me.
It's what I want.
Please.
I'll come and get you in the morning.
First thing.
Thanks, Midget.
Hello.
'Sergeant, it's Jorn.
I'm sorry for calling so early.'
But we've been combing through everything the search parties found at the bunker and I think we have something.
Or rather Detective Baptiste found something.
A receipt, dated from a week ago.
'There was no other human debris down there.
'And, as far as we know, no persons were aware of these tunnels.'
Where's it from?
'A clothes store here in Eckhausen.'
The receipt shows only the last few digits of the card, but we've called them, and we have a name.
Kristian?
!
Argh!
Argh!
What the hell's going on, Sergeant?
We need to question your husband about the abduction of two little girls.
I'm sorry.
Please don't...
Don't blame Matthew.
I-I begged him to do it.
Ssh-ssh.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all right.
I don't like the light coming in to wake me up...
Ssh.
- ..it burns my eyes.
- It'll get better.
I promise you, it'll get better.
You should come inside.
It's freezing.
And...
Well, something's happened.
There's been an arrest.
And the army police, they want you to identify him.
You know, the man that took you.
It's just a photograph.
All you have to do is look at a photograph and say if it's him.
Can you do that, my love?
Good girl.
Alice.
I'm going to show you some pictures, and I need you to tell me if you recognise any of the men in these photos.
That's him.
Must be.
The way she looked at it - this is him, isn't it?
We need a positive identification.
Let me try talking to her.
It might be less overwhelming.
Do you mind?
So, the man in the photo.
Yes, that's him.
Must be something, all this.
Like being able to see again.
I can see just fine.
I always have.
Do you ever hear that fable about the turtle?
He lived in a tiny pond at the foot of a mountain, swimming in circles and playing with frogs.
The thing he loved most was when his friends, the birds, came to visit.
They'd tell him about their adventures, up snowy mountain peaks, lush green valleys.
He desperately wanted to go with them.
But he couldn't - they said - he didn't have any wings.
He replied... .. "You could be my wings."
And the birds came up with this idea.
They got hold of a long stick - they clasped either end of it in their claws.
The turtle would be in the middle of them, and he'd clench his jaw around the stick.
Then they'd be able to take him up into the sky.
Up he went, higher and higher.
And when he looked down and saw the tiny place he used to call his home...
..he said, "Wow."
Opening his mouth.
And he fell back down to earth, cracking his shell into a million pieces.
I've heard that story.
I thought he fell into the ocean.
That's the fairy-tale version.
The one for children.
And you're not a child any more.
Are you?
You don't want to end up like that, Alice.
Hold on to that stick.
How can you live with yourself... ..after what you've done?
Don't stay out here too long.
It's cold.
Tonight on Panorama - the battle for the soul of the Labour Party.
The leader, Jeremy Corbyn, adored by his supporters.
It's not about an individual, it's about what we collectively as a society want to do and want to achieve.
But challenged by his own MPs.
The reason I'm standing is I want the Labour Party to survive.
We've been on the frontline of Labour's Civil War.
The battle for the soul of the Labour
Party is going to be fought out in the streets of Brighton Hove.
I think we are standing absolutely at the edge of a cliff.
It might well be that one or other of the factions or both of us end up going over it.
The fight is turning nasty.
There has been abuse.
There has been bullying.
There have been threats.
It's real.
It's happened to me.
Homophobic, sexist, anti-Semitic, that's nonsense.
Can the party unite or is this the end for Labour?
Unless things change radically and rapidly, it's very doubtful that I'll see another
Labour Government in my lifetime.
Welcome to Brighton, the seaside town with an alternative street.
Summer by the sea and it's holiday weather.
But here inside Labour's biggest local party, the feuding between left and right has grown bitter.
The struggle revolves around
Jeremy Corbyn.
CHEERING
The Labour leader's in town for a leadership campaign rally and so are more than a thousand of his supporters.
I think Jeremy Corbyn is perhaps Britain's greatest hope for a genuinely new type of politics.
Many of the volunteers here are Momentum members, the grass-roots group fiercely loyal to Corbyn.
We are ordinary people who are enthused and who have become active because we've got real hope now.
This is a politics of hope.
Labour's opinion poll ratings look dismal and he's fighting to stay on as leader.
But he's still smiling, counting on
Labour's members, whose votes will decide this election.
Jeremy is a breath of fresh air.
He's actually speaking some sense which is really speaking to the people.
United we're very strong.
United as a party we go forward to create that decent, better society.
Jeremy Corbyn is good at packing out the crowds.
They believe in him and many are drawn to his left-wing policies, anti-Trident, anti-tuition fees and renationalising the railways.
Great job.
I know why I got the job.
Zblt
Corbyn phenomenon is about timing.
Labour's traditional, working-class support has been ebbing away for years.
Jeremy Corbyn has built a new base and made it all his own.
After all those New Labour compromises and one election defeat too many, they wanted something different.
Jeremy
Corbyn may have been around for decades, but he's certainly something different.
Trouble is most Labour MPs believe he's a hopeless leader and they are out to stop him.
Meet the challenger, Corbyn's enemy's are pinning their hopes on him.
Hello there.
Owen Smith calling from the Labour Party...
I think you're better than him.
I'm apparently better than the rest, that will do.
He was one of more than 170 Labour MPs who declared they had no confidence in Jeremy
Corbyn this summer.
And today, he's come to Brighton too, campaigning for a council by-election.
I fear that the Labour Party is in danger of an historic split.
I think this is a battle for the soul of the
Labour Party.
The reason I'm standing is I want the Labour Party to survive.
You're not voting for him?
No.
Oh, well, never mind.
He's won the overwhelming backing of his fellow MPs, who believe Jeremy
Corbyn is far too left-wing, unelectable.
Beware of the dog, they're always my favourite.
We've got to take seriously the fact that the public are moving away from us and that on a whole host of areas for a very long time, on the economy, on immigration, on Social
Security we are losing the argument with the public.
We have to do much better at going out and making the case to the public for why they should support us.
And we haven't done that.
But those close to Corbyn argue Labour's growing membership tells a different story.
Large numbers of people feel the economy and society is not delivering for them.
So they're looking for an alternative.
The Labour Party provides that alternative.
That's why they're joining us.
We're the biggest political party in Europe now.
We're now over half a million, nearly 600,000, I think growing all the time.
I welcome that.
Whoever wins Labour's leadership contest, they're going to have to try to heal the wounds of a brutal few months.
Near Brighton, the fight has been particularly dirty.
No-one knows that better than local Labour MP,
Peter Kyle, a former aide worker and advisor to the Blair Government.
He won the seat from the Tories in the 2015 election, one of the few bright spots in a dismal Labour performance.
We only have one MP in the south-east beneath London now, that's me.
I went through the whole pile.
Unfortunately there's a new pile.
Peter and his team have an unexpected problem, the local party membership has doubled to 6,000 in just over a year.
It's now the biggest in the country and some of those new recruits are out to get him.
There's suddenly just this anger, this visceral anger, which is unchannelled and it's unproductive.
I'm pushed away from huge sections of the new membership.
Democracy is being shut down.
Things are so reductionist either you're a
Corbynite or you're an enemy.
That's not the party that I know and love.
Things came to a head last December, when Peter Kyle voted in favour of air strikes on Syria in a free vote.
In the days that followed, he received abusive and threatening messages.
What I saw during the
Syria debate was something that was a shock for me.
Within the party there was an almost uncontrollable rage within one bit of it, which was being uncited, by people around the leader, within Momentum, people with axes to grind.
Drop into any party meeting in this constituency and
Labour's divisions are loud and clear.
And they're heart felt.
But it strikes me that Jeremy Corbyn's followers are keener on fighting via the social media and I dipped into the Labour Party forum for a week.
I'm made of strong stuff, but these deeply horrible misogynyst, anti-Semitic, homophobic, vitriolic, thick and just mean people sent me away.
I couldn't stand it.
It was messing with my head.
There is a slight bit of prejudgment on new members.
You automatically assume just because we're coming in and supporting Corbyn, we're Trots or stormtroopers or whatever.
We're actually not.
What's happening here is a vivid example of what's happening in local Labour Parties up and down the country, MPs pitted against local members, members against each other and the atmosphere's become increasingly poisonous.
There has been abuse.
There has been bullying.
There have been threats.
It's real.
It's happened to me.
It's happened to many of my colleagues.
Most party members are thoroughly decent, kind people but there are a small minority who are absolutely determined to silence any alternative voices, any debate, any criticism and the party simply can't survive that.
The real worry for me is that it's being used to create an image that the Labour Party is some kind of cesspit, homophobic, sexist, anti-Semitic, this is nonsense.
I'm offended that my party is being accused of that in this way.
It's all done to try and shift the blame on Jeremy Corbyn.
Back in Brighton
Hove, the battle for control of Labour has intensified.
At July's annual general meeting, a group of Corbyn supporters, backed by
Momentum, were elected to key posts.
But then, amid hotly contested allegations of bullying, intimidation and vote rigging, the local party was suspended and is now being investigated.
Greg Hadfield was elected local party secretary that night before the vote was annulled.
A former Daily Mail journalist, he's now one of
Brighton's most devoted Jeremy Corbyn supporters.
I think I'm a
Nescafe socialist.
Even though to some he might look a bit like a
Conservative.
You're not that Tory (BLEEP), are you?
No I'm the secretary of the Labour Party, who was suspended.
I got 66% of socialist vote and then I got suspended.
I thought you were that
Tory bloke.
Because I'm wearing a jacket.
He's off to rally the troops at a meeting organised by Momentum and to turn his fire on the MPs who rebelled against their leader.
We're going to say to Jeremy Corbyn, look behind you, you've got 600,000 members supporting you.
Don't look over your shoaleder to see 176 people trying to stab you in the back because when he wins in September, we'll be there for him and we'll be there for the Labour Party.
APPLAUSE We're now approaching end game, the hidden fractures between the leadership, between MPs, between the members, this is where it's decided.
The battle for the soul of the
Labour Party will be fought out in the streets of Brighton Hove.
I'm determined as a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, we're going to win, because this cannot go on.
In the background to this struggle, are two rival visions - those MPs who mostly believe change should be driven through Parliament and on the other side, those left-wingers who want to build, instead, a mass movement way beyond Westminster.
Some in Labour see fighting for change outside Parliament as undemocratic, but there's also fear of entryists inside the party, members of far-left groups who've deliberately infiltrated Labour.
That's banned under party rules.
Brighton is central to these allegations.
Ivor used to be an MP here, was a minister in Tony Blair's
Government.
He's now gathering evidence and attended the July AGM.
What we are seeing is clear entryism.
We have seen this.
We have evidence that people who stood for election on July 9 are members of other organisations, which are prescribed by the Labour Party and have been prescribed since the 1990s.
That is completely and utterly unacceptable.
These people have hidden it in order to try and gain entryism into the Labour Party and I'm afraid, they have to be got out.
Kept out of the party?
Yes.
Two of those accused of being entryists were elected to the local party's executive committee alongside Greg.
The party is still suspended, so meet the Brighton, Hove and District
Executive Committee in exile, as they like to call themselves.
This one, I stand with Jeremy Corbyn.
It's the basic message.
Brilliant.
Yeah.
There's stickers as well.
These are the Corbyn for Prime
Minister, Corbyn for leader, love socialism sticker.
We completely ran out of the national Jeremy Corbyn badges, but we've made more local ones.
Phil Clarke stood against Labour five times, including the 2015 Council elections.
That's banned under Labour's rules.
I've been in the social party and stood for trade union and socialist coalition.
I did that because I felt that the Labour Party wouldn't again be a voice for working people and the trade unions.
I'm not an entryist.
I made a personal decision to join the Labour Party.
I'm in the a member of any prescribed group in the Labour Party.
I want to see a
Labour Party that is what it was set up to be, which is the voice of working people through the trade unions in Parliament and that's why
I'm a member.
Mark Sandell was elected chairman of the local party until it was suspended.
He's accused of being an entryist because of his support for the controversial far left group the alliance for workers liberty.
It's a socialist organisation, not a party.
It publishes a newspaper which, I think, is a very good newspaper, I support.
But is he a member of the AWL?
We don't have a membership.
Is he a Trotskyite entryist?
I don't see myself as an entryist.
The
Labour Party is the place where my politics will be most effective, it's the place where my politics have a history.
The Labour Party were founded by great socialists who wanted to get rid of capitalism and change the world.
It was also founded bit trade unions, which I've always been a supporter of, where else would I take my politics?
I don't think you should ban people because you don't like their ideas.
But Panorama understands that both men are under investigation by the national party.
They could be banned by Labour for breaching party rules.
So many party argue there is nothing to worry about.
The Alliance for
Workers love the deep, they must be delighted that they keep getting mentioned.
There must be half a dozen of them in the whole country!
You know the argument, we have seen many on the left, some from groups or other parties once opposed to Labour, coming aboard and joining behind Jeremy Corbyn, so the idea of entryism is not a myth, is it?
The vast majority of people who are joining the Labour Party have got nothing to do with Trotskyism or entryism.
Of course, there will be handfuls of people who are old hands, who might be regarded as people who have got a different political agenda.
But for others, talk of entryism is like a grim echo of the past.
Back in the mid-19th 80s, the far left group Militant were a party within a party, and
Neil Kinnock took them on and won.
I am telling you you cannot play politics with people's jobs and with people's services!
So has the problem returned?
The idea that there are 300,000 or more entryists is absurd.
There are people who have returned to the
Labour Party who have the objective of securing the control of the movement by the ultraleft.
They are well organised, they are experienced, they are obsessive, and they probably exert a disproportionate amount of influence.
Early August, and it is Pride weekend.
A celebration of gay rights in Brighton.
Four MP Peter Kyle, today is a reminder of what Labour can achieve when it is in power.
Many of the freedoms that we are celebrating today there were actually granted by a Labour government, the equalisation of the age of consent, gays serving in the military, civil partnerships.
But it is divorced that springs to mind when talk turns to Labour's leadership babble.
What has genuinely taken me by surprise is that the figures are practically 50-50, or 60 for Jeremy, but it is genuinely much closer than I was expecting.
Owen Smith has got an exhaustive schedule of touring around, because we are well aware that he needs to raise his profile, he needs to let people know what he stands for, and you know, let's be
honest, a lot of people are saying, who is Owen Smith?
Momentum is also at Pride, busy signing people up to the Jeremy for Leader campaign.
This kind of street campaigning, harnessing people power, is what the
Corbyn phenomenon is all about.
We are getting enormous amount of support for Corbyn, a lot of them are Labour members, a lot of them are not, but the membership process has just begun.
If Jeremy Corbyn does win the leadership election, some members of the local party are talking about deselecting Peter Kyle.
He would effectively be sacked as the Labour candidate before the next general election.
If you are an MP against nationalising the railways, against ending academy schools, if you are against taxing the rich, if you are politically against stopping the privatisation of the NHS and bringing it back into full public ownership, then why would you want
to stand as a candidate for a party that supports those things?
If he can convince the local members that he will stand for Labour and convince people that those ideas are ones he genuinely supports, then maybe.
I very much doubt he can do that.
Peter Kyle knows he faces a battle to hold his job.
I hope he comes and stands against me so that
I can ask him what he has done for the Labour Party in the last 20 years, and I can say what I have done, and then we can put that to the vote.
But I think the party has probably split more radically than it was in the 1980s.
I think we are standing at the edge of a cliff, and it might well be that one or other of the factions, or both of us, and up going over it.
I think it is that serious.
Do you think this could be the end of the Labour Party?
Of course, no party has a right to exist.
And it is not just Brighton.
Although Jeremy Corbyn denies he wants a purge of hostile MPs, one of his most powerful allies has a clear warning.
I believe some of the MPs have behaved absolutely despicably and disgracefully, and they have not shown any respect whatsoever to the leader.
They should be held to account.
So those vocal dissidents who do not show the respect to the leader that you describe, when it comes to the selection, you say they are asking for it.
Anybody who behaves in a way that is totally disrespectful, out with the culture of the Labour Party, basically they are asking to be held to account.
The trouble with all of this is that it destabilises the party, it means that we are fighting each other, it loosens the collective bonds that we have when we work together and incorporate at local level and deliver real results for people.
And it means that we are distracted from the real task, which is to unite, to move forward, to form not just an opposition but a government in waiting, and take that fight to the
Tories.
Last weekend, and the Trades Union
Congress rolls into Brighton.
While the unions plough through debate after debate about Brexit, workers per role writes, everyone is talking about the future of the party that the union set up to be there political voice, but they are united in agreeing that Labour is in a very
bad place.
Have you ever seen Labour in this kind of condition in your life?
I remember difficult days through the 1980s, people come through in the end because the ultimate lesson is only united parties win.
When you are divided, you lose, and I'm afraid that is the real lesson of politics that everybody has to learn at some point.
Most believe leadership challenger Owen Smith is going to lose.
He is here on the hunt for votes.
Getting towards the end, right, so it has been tough, did you ever think it was going to be as tough as it has turned out to be?
I thought it was going to be exactly this tough right from the beginning, we were under no illusions how this was going to be, it was going to be an argument within the family, and those are always difficult.
You say you think you are going to win, you are the only person I have spoken to who thinks that.
I know what we're doing in terms of the phone calls we have been making, the contacts we have been making, and it shows it is evenly balanced, and I will keep on going right to the.
With the race almost over, Jeremy Corbyn looks like a winner, but can he win the election which matters the most?
You must accept that, from where you stand now, you have got a mountain to climb to get anywhere near being a credible alternative government, you are not going to denied that, are you?
Don't judge everything by opinion polls, think of a couple of factors.
The last general election, less than half of the young people who had registered to vote actually took part in the election.
In the poorest parts of the country, the turnout was the lowest.
The involvement of young people in political activity is far greater than it was a year ago.
So you are relying on people voting who have not voted in the past and who tend not to vote.
Is that pie in the sky?
No pies in any sky!
Do you accept that your party has to unite again or face political oblivion?
We have to unite as a party, and actually by and large we are united as a party.
I say to the Parliamentary Labour Party, come together.
Since the Brexit vote, British politics has never been quite so volatile.
Or the country so divided.
Many year and for a stronger opposition to the Government.
And even Team Corbyn tell me, frankly, they need to improve.
Do you need to deliver a better performance in opposing the Government?
We have all got to raise the level of our game and learn lessons.
I have had enough of politicians who think they are God's gift to politics, we have made mistakes like everybody else, we are willing to learn the lessons from our own PLP, particularly members who have been in this position.
A bit of tutoring from old hands.
Why not?
Most expect Jeremy Corbyn will win, but if he does, even with tutoring, reuniting the party now looks as good as impossible.
Some MPs who resigned from his Shadow Cabinet have told me privately they are contemplating returning to the team, but they won't pledge loyalty to his leadership.
Hostility to Jeremy Corbyn runs deep.
Not just in my lifetime, but stretching back to the 1930s, by any examination, this is the greatest crisis that the Labour Party has faced.
You believe you may not see another Labour government in your lifetime, then?
I am 74, and unless things change radically and rapidly, it is very doubtful that I will see another Labour government in my lifetime.
For all the dire warnings, Labour MPs I have spoken to do not believe
Labour is about to split, but without reconnecting to the millions of voters who have turned their backs, Labour faces a dark future - slow decay, broken as a major force in British politics.
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
Nm
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
Hmm.
With Mac.
ABDICI Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac: and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.
- Hey, it's Tom.
- Sorry I missed you.
I'll get right back to you.
Hey, Tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish Momma a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Mom...
- Rachel!
Jesus.
No,no,no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
TOM".
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd justjerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
RACHEL". on, my God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
Okay?
I just...
You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachefl Cathy, just go away!
- Come here for one second.
- Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
I've got 22 days back.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm Rachel and...
- Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I...
Becauselu.
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Thank you, Rachel.
Right?
It was that, um...
The homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter.
That was a tube top, right?
Yep, it was.
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.
"And I can't wait becauseifsfun to dress up."
Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled eggs.
Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your oorn?
Rachel.
Put a couple on the wall...
Rachel!
I'm fine, Tom!
Stop it.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
Rachel.
You never fucking support me.
Rachel, please stop it!
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
Relax!
Rachel.
There you are.
Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6200.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
No, I don't think so.
Isthatbecause you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, Okay-
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, butlhaveto keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL'.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
Dr. Kama!
Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
InevercaHed to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, lthoughtabout contacting Abdic: myself.
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rash ,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely... ltjust broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1.'33 and 1.'34, 1.'37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
H Y- e Hey-
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDK)'.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body found.
"Megan Hipwell.
Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed.
"Investigation now being called a homicide.
"Sources say the partially decomposed body found
"is missing Ardsley woman, Megan Hipwell.
"Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott baok home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestlyjust trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You'?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
Please!
God.
Ineedto file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't aooount for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night inthetunneL I saw you there and...
All right.
I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
Vvhathappened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
- Come here for one second.
- Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage,
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and...
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL".
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh,God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hi, it's Megan.
Leave a message.
You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Oh.
Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, don't.
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Lethergo.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Lethergo.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
- 911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did...
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Shh.
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Becauselthought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
Fixed Synced by bozxphd.
Enjoy The Flick
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He's a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...
Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett road.
- No.
- It was my first home.
We bought it together.
- It was ours.
-You didn't even like having him over.
I hated it.
Every day, I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No, it's...
Come.
It's all yours.
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!
Is it a... is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet.
How ol... how old is he?
- Six months.
- Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
Here.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
Down the center line, open, around and together...
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
Around and up.
But since moving here,
I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager... lover...
Waitress...
Gallery director...
Nanny... and...
A whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I...
Stay awake at night staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was...
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me want to get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Aw, daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
Oh.
Whew... ah...
- There.
-
-There you go.
Come here.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.
Oh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
- I mean, look at her.
Look at her.
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
-:
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
Mm.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just, this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this without child care, but...
You don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market...
It's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time...
As I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
I...
- Rachel.
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Oh.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Mm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
- You have to talk to her.
- I know.
I-I...
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop.
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Oh.
Shame.
Thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mm.
So did I.
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.
- I'll get right back to you.
Hey, tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish mama a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.
Jesus.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
- Relax.
Relax!
- Cathy, come on!
I just...
I just need some to go to sleep.
That's all.
I just need...
I just...
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for...
For a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
I've rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
Well, when we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
The next station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
-
-God, I wish
I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me,
I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer
-until they were together.
I know what they say, and you shouldn't check his e-mail.
It was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's, and my husband was fucking a century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd, and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
Oh, I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I...
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman...
Kissing someone else, just...
I... betraying her husband,
I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again, and... just thought if I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house and I'd go and...
Find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blond hair, and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back.
And then I'd pull it down to the ground, and I would just...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Move.
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
Uh, what the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You... you scared the shit out of Anna.
- Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She-she wanted to call the police, so just...
- Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my god.
God.
God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
- Okay?
I just...
- You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days one to 90, who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.
- Nice.
- There we go.
-Good job.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm-I'm Rachel and...
Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.
This is day one, I-I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I... because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had...
I had bruises all over my arm and, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned, when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's some time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Am I... am I right?
- Or am I nuts?
- No.
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.
That was a charity event.
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.
Right?
It was that, um, the homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, oh, safe shelter.
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?
Yup.
It was.
I can't.
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,
"and I can't wait because it's fun to dress up." Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
Uh, those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn?
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?
Rachel.
I'm fine, tom!
- Stop it.
- Come on.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
- That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk
- to me like that!
- Relax!
Relax!
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy.
I'm sorry.
- There you are.
- I need to get my shit together.
- I'm s...
- Shh.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm detective Riley.
This is detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I-I was at work in the city, and then... and then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
I...
So...
What'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean, she's missing?
Well, her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!
- Did you see her?
No, I don't...
I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I...
I-I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for, just tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
O-okay, okay.
I just, I-I got on the train, and then... and then I...
I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in long island...
Who blacked out.
He left a bar, drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning, oblivious to what he did until the police came to get him.
- Rachel!
- What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but, uh, not on Friday night.
She...
She was having an affair, she had a lover... that's what
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I s... but I saw her.
- You saw her where?
- I-I saw her from the train.
She was standing on-on the deck with this man.
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No, it wasn't him.
This... man was different, and th-they were...
They were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I-I know it sounds crazy.
Um...
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited, and that on one occasion you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men and the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive, jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett road
"and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards
"have been used since Friday.
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
And the cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I...
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...?
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So, you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife...
With someone...
On Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He-he was...
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
Uh, it could...
I-I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no, n...
Um, I haven't heard anything.
But you know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I, we took... we took yog...
We took Pilates... together.
I-I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time, and...
So sorry to have had to tell you...
Tell you that in that way and...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, ab...
Abdic...
Abdic.
Uh, Kamal...
Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me!
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
- Megan.
No!
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Meg...
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?
¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?
Ah, ah, sí.
¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?
Me estás volviendo...
¡Me estás volviendo loco!
¡me estás volviendo loco!
Dr. Kamal Abdic...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll... they'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...
- He's the one...
- He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I...
I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No, we j...
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
- Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh.
Come here.
Oh, you're heavy.
You're heavy.
- You're getting a little fatty.
- Rachel, no.
Anna, get in the house.
Your-your... your wife hit me on Friday night!
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No, that is not what happened.
She was... she was in the tunnel, and she-she hit me.
I don't want to argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
- How?
- To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan.
Rach...
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories.
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No, sorry, I-I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...
Sorry, I was just, uh, just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Mm...
Well, when I...
Wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done... it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed, that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
And you want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art.
I guess.
Good.
We can try to...
Regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
And we tried everything, and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my...
My heart, and...
So it got really sad.
And then, um... and then the-the booze just, uh, broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the...
Embodiment of...
True love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34.
1:37.
She calls again 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 P.M.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log of the calls;
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house
- since the incident with your child?
- Not that I know of.
Well, then you may have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah, I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and... and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so...
I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me.
Put her on my chest.
Her head just... under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I...
I couldn't look.
I didn't want to see it.
I didn't want to see it.
I wrapped her in a blanket, and I buried her.
And...
Mac went out that night... and he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
And I know this sounds...
Insane...
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel...
Give her to me.
Shh, shh, shh.
Oh.
Mommy's here.
- Shh.
Oh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.

"Blunt force trauma, partially decomposed body found...

"Death a result of blunt force trauma.

- Mr. Hipwell!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
- She's dangerous, and you know it.
- Anna, Anna.
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How di... how did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know, I don't know what this is about...
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must've known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead.
And you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you, you know?
For getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic.
And I-I went to him to help you...
You're just a sad liar with no life.
- You're all liars.
- Please...
I need to file a statement.
Name.
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No, we-we were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...
You need the context...
I know the context, but what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you!
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
The next station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
Uh...
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
- And I-I know I saw you there.
- All right.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But-but what did you, what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right, you, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
- Was I, was I alone?
Was i... what happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa, take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
Uh...
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband,
I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
-I'd find her sitting and...
I'd smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha.
Martha.
Rachel?
Wow, I haven't seen you in a million years.
Um...
Yeah, I-I wanted to call you, um, but tom said I should just leave it alone.
- Oh.
- Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
And I just need you to know that I-I don't remember anything and, um,
I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink,
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh, with the eggs and then I-I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom... tom said that, um...
That I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
You want to lie down?
- Come with me.
- Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay tonight if you want.
- No, no.
That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then tom took you home.
- Sorry, tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
N-no.
No.
Yeah, tom got fired 'cause he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel.
Wake the fuck up!
- Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Oh, god.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hi, it's Megan.

You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just, I...
Well, come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here, okay?
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
Just need some help.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Just need to get a little help up.
- Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
- Come on.
Come on.
You're heavy.
Aw.
Come here.
Anna?
No.
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.
- There's... okay.
- Go!
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's tom?
He's lying to you.
He-he always does.
He's-he's a good liar...
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he-he killed Megan...
No, we don't, we don't know that.
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No.
No.
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie
- and you need to leave, get out of here.
- No.
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you... you know that deep down.
Anna, please,
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Now, listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!
Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So, were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
You... you were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom?
- Give her to me.
- That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom, give her to me, please?
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.
I think she needs changing, please.
No, she's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay.
Shh, shh.
- Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Shh.
You're okay, you're okay.
Shh, shh.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No, no.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train...
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So, what is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
This what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You were a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
Come on.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're... you're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
I can just... yeah.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And you can kick them.
They keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
You'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
Mm-hmm.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
No...
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would've killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would've killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
*THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN (2016)* Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He's a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...
Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett road.
- No.
- It was my first home.
We bought it together.
- It was ours.
-You didn't even like having him over.
I hated it.
Every day, I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No, it's...
Come.
It's all yours.
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!
Is it a... is it a boy?
Yeah!
- So sweet.
- How ol... how old is he?
- Six months.
- Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
Here.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
down the center line, open, around and together...
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
around and up.
But since moving here,
I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager... lover...
Waitress...
Gallery director...
Nanny... and...
A whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I...
Stay awake at night staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always... felt that way?
Maybe since I was...
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.
With Mac.
Mm-hmm.
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me want to get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Aw, daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
Oh.
Whew... ah...
- There.
-
-There you go.
Come here.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.
Oh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her.
You're not sleeping.
- Hello?
- You're not sleeping.
Hello?
Hello?
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
Mm.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just, this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts Tomorrow.
I'm out all day Tomorrow.
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this without child care, but...
You don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market...
It's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time...
As I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
I...
- Rachel.
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Oh.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Mm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
- You have to talk to her.
- I know.
I-I...
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop.
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Oh.
Shame.
Thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mm.
So did I.
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
- I'll get right back to you.
Hey, Tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish mama a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.
Jesus.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
- Relax!
- Cathy, come on!
I-I-I-I just...
I just need some to go to sleep.
That's all.
I just need...
I just...
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for...
For a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
Ivf rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
Well, when we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
The next station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
-
- God, I wish
I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me,
I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer
-until they were together.
I know what they say, and you shouldn't check his e-mail.
It was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not x's, and my husband was fucking a century 21 agent.
That... sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd, and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
Oh, I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I...
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman... kissing someone else, just...
I... betraying her husband,
I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again, and... just thought if I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house and I'd go and...
Find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blond hair, and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back.
And then I'd pull it down to the ground, and I would just...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Move.
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
Uh, what the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You... you scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She-she wanted to call the police, so just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my god.
God.
God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.
Rachel, are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
- Okay?
I just...
- You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days one to 90, who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.
- Nice.
- There we go.
-Good job.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm-I'm Rachel and...
Welcome, Rachel.
Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.
This is day one, I-I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I... because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had...
I had bruises all over my arm and, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned, when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's some time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Am I... am I right?
- Or am I nuts?
- No.
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.
That was a charity event.
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.
Right?
It was that, um, the homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, oh, safe shelter.
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?
Yup.
It was.
I can't.
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go",
"and I can't wait because it's fun to dress up." Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
Uh, those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn?
Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?
Rachel.
I'm fine, Tom!
- Stop it.
- Come on.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk Relax!
- To me like that!
Relax!
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy.
I'm sorry.
- There you are.
- I need to get my shit together.
- I'm s...
- Shh.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm detective Riley.
This is detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I-I was at work in the city, and then... and then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
I...
So...
What'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean, she's missing?
Well, her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!
- Did you see her?
No, I don't...
I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I...
I-I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for, just tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
O-Okay, Okay.
I just, I-i got on the train, and then... and then I...
I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in long island...
Who blacked out.
He left a bar, drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning, oblivious to what he did until the police came to get him.
- Rachel!
- What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but, uh, not on Friday night.
She...
She was having an affair, she had a lover... that's what
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I s... but I saw her.
- You saw her where?
- I-I saw her from the train.
She was standing on-on the deck with this man.
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No, it wasn't him.
This... man was different, and th-they were...
They were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I-I know it sounds crazy.
Um...
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited, and that on one occasion you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men and the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive, jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,"
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett road"
"and disappeared."
"No one has seen her since."
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards"
"have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,"
"an intensely private person with a warm heart."
"She lost a brother when she was 16,"
"and both her parents died a few years ago."
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
And... the cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I...
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...?
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So, you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife...
With someone...
On Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He-he was...
He was average height.
He had... dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
Uh, it could...
I-I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no, n...
Um, I haven't heard anything.
But you know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I, we took... we took yog...
We took pilates... together.
I-I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time, and...
So sorry to have had to tell you...
Tell you that in that way and...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Ab...
Abdic...
Abdic.
Uh, Kamal...
Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me!
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
- Megan.
No!
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Meg...
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
¿Qué es lo que tú quieres de mí?
¿Qué es lo que tú quieres de mí?
Ah, ah, sí.
¿Qué es lo que tú quieres de mí?
Me estás volviendo...
¡me estás volviendo loco!
¡me estás volviendo loco!
Dr.Kamal Abdec...
Dr.Kamal Abdec has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll... they'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...
- He's the one...
- He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I...
I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No, we j...
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
- Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh.
Come here.
Oh, you're heavy.
You're heavy.
Rachel, no.
Anna, get in the house.
Your-your... your wife hit me on Friday night!
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No, that is not what happened.
She was... she was in the tunnel, and she-she hit me.
I don't want to argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
- How?
- To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan.
Rach...
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories.
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No, sorry, I-I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...
Sorry, I was just, uh, just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Mm...
Well, when I...
Wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done... it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed, that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
And you want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art.
I guess.
Good.
We can try to...
Regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
And we tried everything, and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my...
My heart, and...
So it got really sad.
And then, um... and then the-the booze just, uh, broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the...
Embodiment of...
True love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34.
1:37.
She calls again 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 P.M.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log of the calls;
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house
- since the incident with your child?
- Not that I know of.
Well, then you may have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah, I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that... people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and... and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so...
I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me.
Put her on my chest.
Her head just... under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I...
I couldn't look.
I didn't want to see it.
I didn't want to see it.
I wrapped her in a blanket, and I buried her.
And...
Mac went out that night... and he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
And I know this sounds...
Insane...
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel...
Give her to me.
Shh, shh, shh.
Oh.
Mommy's here.
- Shh.
Oh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Blunt force trauma, partially decomposed body found...
"Megan Hipwell, blunt force trauma,
"partially decomposed...
"The investigation now being called a homicide.
"Sources say the partially decomposed body found
"is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
"Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
- Mr. Hipwell!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
- She's dangerous, and you know it.
- Anna, Anna.
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How di... how did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know, I don't know what this is about...
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must've known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead.
And you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you, you know?
For getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic.
And I-I went to him to help you...
You're just a sad liar with no life.
- You're all liars.
- Please...
I need to file a statement.
Name.
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No, we-we were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...
You need the context...
I know the context, but what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you!
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
The next station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
Uh...
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
- And I-I know I saw you there.
- All right.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But-But what did you, what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right, you, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
- Was I, was I alone?
Was I... what happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa, take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
Uh...
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband,
I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
- I'd find her sitting and...
I'd smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy,
Thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha.
Martha.
Rachel?
Wow, I haven't seen you in a million years.
Um...
Yeah, I-I wanted to call you, um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
- Oh.
- Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
And...
I just need you to know that I-I don't remember anything and, um,
I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink,
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh, with the eggs and then I-I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom...
Tom said that, um...
That I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
You want to lie down?
- Come with me.
- Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay tonight if you want.
- No, no.
That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
- Sorry, Tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
N-no.
No.
Yeah, Tom got fired 'cause he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel.
Wake the fuck up!
- Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here, okay?
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
Don't touch me..
Don't touch me.
Just...
- Come on.
Come on.
- Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
You're heavy.
Aw.
Come here.
Anna?
No.
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.
- There's... okay.
- Go!
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He-He always does.
He's-He's a good liar...
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he-he killed Megan...
No, we don't, we don't know that.
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No.
No.
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie
- and you need to leave, get out of here.
-No.
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you... you know that deep down.
Anna, please,
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Now, listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!
Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So, were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
You... you were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom?
- Give her to me.
- That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom, give her to me, please?
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.
I think she needs changing, please.
No, she's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay.
Shh, shh.
- Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Shh.
You're okay, you're okay.
Shh, shh.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No, no.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train...
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So, what is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
This what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You were a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
Come on.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're... you're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
I can just... yeah.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And you can kick them.
They keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
You'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just...
left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
Mm-hmm.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
No...
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would've killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would've killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.

RACHEL:
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)
RACHEL:
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (CHUCKUNG) No!
RACHEL:
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
WOMAN:
Are you alone?
RACHEL:
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.

MEGAN:
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MEGAN:
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
ABDIC:
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
ABDIC:
Hmm.
With Mac.
ABDIC:
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
(SNIFFLES)
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
ABDIC:
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(SOFTLY) Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?

It's getting crazy.
I will.

Don't I always make everything fine?

Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.

Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
RACHEL:
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
(SNIFFLES)
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
it does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
(SOBBING) It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!

I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.

I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6200.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
(STUTTERING) No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
CATHY:
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
(STAMMERING) I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, Okay-
(STAMMERING)
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar... (VOICE FADING) ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
MEGAN:
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
(SNIFFLES)
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Except you.
ABDIC:
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
RACHEL: "Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
RACHEL:
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
(STAMMERING) I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
(STAMMERS)
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
Fuck!
(CLATTERING)
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
(CHUCKLES)
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey-
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL'.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
MEGAN:
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
(MEGAN MOANING)
Stay away from me.
MEGAN: (CRYING) This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Megan.
(SCREAMING)
Megan.
(MEGAN SNIFFLING)
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
RACHEL:
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
SCOTT:
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
ANNA:
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
(STUTTERING) Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of What?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach ,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
Is that correct?
RACHEL:
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
(CHUCKLES)
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
RACHEL:
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
RACHEL:
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
(SOBS)
(VOICE BREAKING) lt just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
(SNIFFLING)
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
ANNA:
July 5th.
1.'33 and 1.'34, 1.'37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
(SCOFFS)
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(DOOR OPENS)
(CHUCKLES)
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
(FOOTSTEPS)
(CLATTERING)
Hi.
SCOTT:
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
ABDIC:
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
(EXHALES)
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
(SNIFFLES) it was easy.
Because I loved her.
(SOBBING) I loved her.
(SNIFFLES)
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
(CONTINUES SNIFFLING)
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The roof was leaking.
(WATER DRIPPING)
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
(CRYING) I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
(CHANDELIER JINGLING)
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDIC:
Who's Evie?
RACHEL:
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
ANNA:
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
(CRYING) ANNA:
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Shh.
RACHEL:
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.

(REPORTERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
(SNIFFLES)
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
(CHUCKLES)
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
You're just a sad liar with no life.
(GLASS SHATTERS) You're all liars.
Please!
(SOBBING)
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
(WATER RUNNING)
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
(SIGHS)
MEGAN:
I can still see her dark eyes
- I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
ABDIC:
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
(WHISPERS) You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
All right. (STAMMERING) I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and... (SCREAMING)
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL:
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
(BRAKES SQUEAKING)
MARTHA: (LAUGHING) That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
MARTHA:
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
MARTHA:
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
TOM:
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
MARTHA:
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh,God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
TOM:
I need to see you- Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.

Anna?

Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
(DOOR OPENS)
Anna, don't.
TOM:
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
(EVIE CRYING)
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
TOM:
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
(EVIE CONTINUES CRYING) Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.

What's your emergency?
TOM:
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did... (DRINK POURING)
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
(SNIFFLES)
(GLASS SLIDING)
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
(GASPS)
(RACHEL COUGHS)
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
(EVIE MOANING) ANNA:
Shh.

Rachel's down there.
Wait here.

TOM:
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
TOM:
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
(SIGHS)
What is it with you crazy women?
(MOANING)
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
(LOCK RATTLING)
No!
(SHUSHING)
(CHOKING)
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
(GROANING)
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?

He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
ANNA:
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
RACHEL:
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.

In fact, the only time i feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was...
-About 17.
-Mm-hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me want to get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Aw, daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
Oh.
Whew... ah...
- There.
-
-There you go.
Come here.
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.
-Oh.
Oh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
- I mean, look at her.
Look at her.
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
-:
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
- Hello?
-Is that another hang-up?
-Mm-hmm.
Andgrabthecorners.
Mm.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just, this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
-That is so uncool.
-I hate to leave you like this without child care, but...
You don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market...
It's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time...
As I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
I...
- Rachel.
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Oh.
-Thank you.
-Here.
Mm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
-You have to talk to her.
-I know.
I-i...
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
-Okay.
-It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
--Stop.
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
-No, I like it at home.
-Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Oh.
Shame.
Thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mm.
So did I.
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.
- I'll get right back to you.
Hey, tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish mama a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, mama.
-Rachel.
Jesus.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
-Relax.
Relax!
-Cathy, come on!
I just...
I just need some to go to sleep.
That's all.
I just need...
I just...
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
-It was a cute picture.
-Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that i would just be here for...
For a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
Ivf rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It'sokay,sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
Well, when we can, we will.

--I know what they say, and you shouldn't check his e-mail.
It was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not x's, and my husband was fucking a century 21 agent.
--That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd, and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
Oh, I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I...
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman...
Kissing someone else, just...
I... betraying her husband,
I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again, and... just thought if I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house and I'd go and...
Find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blond hair, and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back.
And then I'd pull it down to the ground, and I would just...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Move.
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
Uh, what the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You... you scared the shit out of Anna.
- Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She-she wanted to call the police, so just...
- Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my god.
God.
God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
-Okay?
I just...
-You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
--Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- You whore!
No!
Anyonecountingdays oneto90 , who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
-I've got 22 days back.
-Nice.
-There we go.
-Good job.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm-I'm Rachel and...
Welcome, Rachel.
Hi, Rachel.
-And this... thank you.
This is day one, i-i suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had...
I had bruises all over my arm and, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned, when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's some time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Am I... am I right?
- Or am I nuts?
- No.
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.
That was a charity event.
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.
Right?
It was that, um, the homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, oh, safe shelter.
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?
Yup.
It was.
I can't.
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,
"and I can't wait because it's fun to dress up." Then dress up.
Doyoulike devil'seggs,Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
-Deviled egg.
-Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
Uh, those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn?
Rachel.
-Put a couple on the wall?
Rachel.
I'm fine, tom!
-Stop it.
-Come on.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
- That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
-I'm your wife and you never...
-Rachel.
-You never fucking support me.
-Rachel, please stop it.
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.
Don'tfuckingtalk
-to me like that!
-Relax!
Relax!
-Rachel.
-Hi, Cathy.
I'm sorry.
-There you are.
-I need to get my shit together.
-I'm s...
-Shh.
You must be Ms. Watson.
--I'm detective Riley.
This is detective gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I-i was at work in the city, and then and then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at ardsley-on-Hudson, and then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
I...
So...
What'd you do during those hours in ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean, she's missing?
Well, her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was just...
Do you know Megan hipwell?
-No!
-Did you see her?
No, I don't...
I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I...
I-i ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for, just tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
O-okay, okay.
I just, i-i got on the train, and then... and then I...
I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in long island...
Who blacked out.
He left a bar, drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
Hewokeup thenextmorning, oblivious to what he did until the police cametogethim .
-Rachel!
-What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
-I'll give you a few weeks...
-Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
-Yeah, I agree with you.
-Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan hipwell, but, uh, not on Friday night.
She...
She was having an affair, she had a lover-- that's what
-I'm trying to tell you.
-I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I s... but I saw her.
-You saw her where?
-I-i saw her from the train.
She was standing on-on the deck with this man.
-With her husband, Scott hipwell?
-No, it wasn't him.
This... man was different, and th-they were...
They were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I-i know it sounds crazy.
Um...
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited, and that on one occasion you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
Youknow,Ilie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but i have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men and the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive, jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?

Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
-Do you want a coffee?
-Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
And the cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I...
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...?
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So, you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife...
With someone...
On Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
--I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He-he was...
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
Uh, it could-- i-i don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no, n...
Um, I haven't heard anything.
But you know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I, we took... we took yog...
We took pilates... together.
I-i think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time, and...
So sorry to have had to tell you...
Tell you that in that way and...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, ab...
Abdic... abdic.
Uh, kamal... abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That'shim.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me!
Thisisso stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
- Megan.
No!
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Meg...
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...

Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
-What?
-There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll... they'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
-The police think I did it.
-Yeah, but he's...
-He's the one...
-He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, i...
I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No, we j...
We just need to find more evidence on abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting abdic myself.
- Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh.
Come here.
Oh, you're heavy.
You're heavy.
-You're getting a little fatty.
-Rachel, no.
Anna, get in the house.
Your-your... your wife hit me on Friday night!
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No, that is not what happened.
She was... she was in the tunnel, and she-she hit me.
I don't want to argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
-Let's start with child abduction.
-That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
-How?
-To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan.
Rach...
I don't think you're helping anybody.
Soyou'rehere becauseyouwant to uncover lost memories.
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No, sorry, i-i, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
-Unless you are.
-No, no, I...
Sorry, I was just, uh, just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Mm...
Well, when I...
Wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed, that I have a i just don't feel bad enough.
And you want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art.
I guess.
Good.
We can try to...
Regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
And we tried everything, and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my...
My heart, and...
So it got really sad.
And then, um and then the-the booze just, uh, broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the...
Embodiment of...
True love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July5th.
1:33and1: 34.
1:37.
She calls again 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 P.M.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
-Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
-You have a log of the calls;
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house
-since the incident with your child?
-Not that I know of.
Well, then you may have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She has been hanging around Scott hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah, I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
--Hi.
- Hey.
-Hi.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
Youshouldn'tbe here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and... and left.
Theroofwasleaking.
Itwasfreezingcold,so...
Igotin thetub .

Her head just... under my chin.

I let her go.
I let her go.
I...
Icouldn'tlook.
Ididn'twanttoseeit.
Ididn'twant toseeit .
I wrapped her in a blanket, and I buried her.
And...
Mac went out that night and he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
Idecidedto go there.
Thefrontdoorwas open;
It'snotlikeIbrokein.
AndthenIheardEvie .

Oh.

- Mr. hipwell!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
-She's dangerous, and you know it.
-Anna, Anna.
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How di-- how did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know, I don't know what this is about...
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must've known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead.
And you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
-Who does this?
-I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you, you know?
For getting abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about abdic.
And i-i went to him to help you...
You're just a sad liar with no life.
-You're all liars.
-Please...
I need to file a statement.
Name.
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott hipwell?
No, we-we were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight
-at your apartment, right?
-No, you-you...
You need the context...
I know the context, but what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you!
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
Icanstillsee her darkeyes .
Icansmellher skin.
Icanfeelhow coldshewas.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
The next station is ardsley-on-Hudson.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
Uh...
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
-And i-i know I saw you there.
-All right.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But-but what did you, what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right, you, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
- Was I, was I alone?
Was i-- what happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa, take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
Uh...
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband,
Ifeltit .
Purerage.
IfI could, I'dgoto herhouse,
-I'dfindhersittingand...
I'dsmashherhead all over the floor!
Cathy, thankyouforall youhavedonefor me.

Love,Rachel.
That's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha.
Martha.
Rachel?
Wow, I haven't seen you in a million years.
Um...
Yeah, i-i wanted to call you, um, but tom said I should just leave it alone.
-Oh.
-Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
And I just need you to know that i-i don't remember anything and, um,
I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink,
-so it's okay.
-I know, but, uh, with the eggs and then i-i screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, i just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom... tom said that, um...
That I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Youwantto liedown?
-Come with me.
-Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay tonight if you want.
-No, no.
That's fine, thanks.
-Okay.
IthinkI'dremember ifyoucausedascene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then tom took you home.
-Sorry, tom...
-Stop fucking saying that!
-I know you're sorry!
-Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
N-no.
No.
Yeah, tom got fired 'cause he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wakethefuckup, Rachel.
Wakethefuckup!
- Wake up!
You can sleep out here.

Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here, okay?
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
Just need some help.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Just need to get a little help up.
-Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
-Come on.

You're heavy.
Aw.
Come here.
Anna?
No.
-Anna, please, please?
-No, go away.
-There's-- okay.
-Go!
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's tom?
He's lying to you.
He-he always does.
He's-he's a good liar...
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he-he killed Megan...
No, we don't, we don't know that.
-He's dangerous.
-We don't know anything.
-Anna, you-you need to leave.
-No.
No.
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie
-and you need to leave, get out of here.
-No.
-It's not safe...
-I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you... you know that deep down.
Anna, please,
-just come with me.
-I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
-Anna, don't, don't...
-Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Now, listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
-Did Megan get in your car?
-No!
Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So, were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
You... you were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom?
-Give her to me.
-That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom, give her to me, please?
-Please give her to me.
-It's fine.
I think she needs changing, please.
No, she's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay.
Shh, shh.
-Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
-Change her here.
-Change her here.
-You're-- okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Shh.
You're okay, you're okay.
Shh, shh.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No, no.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things-- i didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train...
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So, what is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
This what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You were a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
Come on.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're... you're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
I can just... yeah.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And you can kick them.
They keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
Mm-hmm.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
--No...
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would've killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would've killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.

(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
RACHEL:
My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)
RACHEL:
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
- (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) - (CHUCKLING) No!
RACHEL:
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
WOMAN:
Are you alone?
RACHEL:
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
- Six months.
- Six months.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
So sweet.
(BABY MOANING SOFTLY)
WOMAN:
Shh.
MEGAN:
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MEGAN:
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
ABDIC:
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
- ABDIC:
Hmm.
- With Mac.
ABDIC:
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
(SNIFFLES)
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
ABDIC:
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night, I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(SOFTLY) Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
(CHUCKLES)
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan. (GRUNTS)
(IMITATES WHOOSHING)
There you go.
- (EVIE COOS)
- MEGAN:
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello. (CHUCKLES)
- (COOS AND GRUNTS) - (LAUGHS)
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her. (LAUGHS) Look at her!
- (TELEPHONE RINGING) - (ANNA GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) You're not sleeping!
MEGAN:
Hello?
(WHISPERING) You're not sleeping.
MEGAN:
Hello?
Hello?
(LINE DISCONNECTS)
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mmm-hmm.
ANNA:
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
(KEYS JINGLE)
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
(SIGHS)
(KEYS JINGLE)

Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
- TOM:
Hello?
- (DOOR OPENS)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
- (LAUGHING)
- Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.

Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.

Hey, Tom.
It's me.

No, no, no.
- No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
- Relax.
- Cathy, come on!
- Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?
- Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
(CHUCKLES)
Get some sleep.
(SWITCH CLICKS)
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
TOM: (SOFTLY) It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.

I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?

She's throwing it all away.

TOM:
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
RACHEL:
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um... (SNIFFLES)
When I saw it was from the realtor, I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
- That sucks.
- It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
(SOBBING) It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!

She thought you were gonna...

It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.

I need to get my shit together.
RILEY:
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
- Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!
- Did you see her?
- (STUTTERING) No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
CATHY:
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
(STAMMERING) I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
(STAMMERING)
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar... (FADING) ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
MEGAN:
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
(SNIFFLES)
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Except you.
ABDIC:
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
RACHEL: "Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
RACHEL:
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
(STAMMERING) I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
(STAMMERS)
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
Fuck!
(CLATTERING)
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
(CHUCKLES)
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL:
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
MEGAN:
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
(MEGAN MOANING)
Stay away from me.
MEGAN: (CRYING) This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Megan.
(SCREAMING)
Megan.
(MEGAN SNIFFLING)
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
RACHEL:
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
- Yeah!
- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
SCOTT:
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
ANNA:
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
(STUTTERING) Your wife hit me on Friday night.
- No.
What are you talking about?
- Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
- Is that correct?
- RACHEL:
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
- Well, you have an accent.
- (CHUCKLES)
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
- Unless you are.
- No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
RACHEL:
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
RACHEL:
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
(SOBS)
(VOICE BREAKING) It just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
(SNIFFLING)
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
ANNA:
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
(SCOFFS)
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

SCOTT:
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
ABDIC:
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
(EXHALES)
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
(SNIFFLES)
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
(SOBBING) I loved her.
(SNIFFLES)
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
(CONTINUES SNIFFLING)
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The roof was leaking.
(WATER DRIPPING)
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
(CRYING) I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
(CHANDELIER JINGLING)
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDIC:
Who's Evie?
RACHEL:
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
ANNA:
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
- (CRYING)
- ANNA:
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Shh.
RACHEL:
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.

This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
- She's dangerous and you know it.
- Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.

What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink. (CHUCKLES)
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
You're just a sad liar with no life.
- (GLASS SHATTERS)
- You're all liars.
Please!
(SOBBING)
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
(WATER RUNNING)
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
(SIGHS)
MEGAN:
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
ABDIC:
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
(WHISPERS) You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
- All right.
- (STAMMERING) I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and... (SCREAMING)
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL:
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
(BRAKES SQUEAKING)
MARTHA: (LAUGHING) That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
- Oh.
- Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
MARTHA:
Do you wanna lie down?
- Come with me.
- Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
MARTHA:
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
TOM:
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
MARTHA:
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
TOM:
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
(DOOR LOCK CLICKING)
(DOOR OPENS)
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.

Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.

- You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
ANNA:
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
(ANNA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Anna?
- No.
Go away!
- Anna, please.
Please.
- There's...
Okay.
- Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
- Anna, he killed Megan.
- No, we don't...
We don't know that.
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.
- Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
- No.
No.
- You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
- No.
- Get out of here.
It's not safe.
- I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
- Anna, please, just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
(DOOR OPENS)
- Anna, don't.
- TOM:
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
(EVIE CRYING)
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
TOM:
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
- (EVIE CONTINUES CRYING)
- Tom, give her to me.
Please.
- Please give her to me.
- She's fine.
- I think she needs changing, please?
- She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
- Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
(LINE RINGING)
- FEMALE OPERATOR: 911, what's your...
- (GASPS)
What's your emergency?
TOM:
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did... (DRINK POURING)
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
(SNIFFLES)
(GLASS SLIDING)
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
- Drink it!
- (GASPS)
(RACHEL COUGHS)
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!

Shh.

Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
TOM:
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
TOM:
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
(SIGHS)
What is it with you crazy women?
(MOANING)
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
(LOCK RATTLING)
No!
(SHUSHING)
(CHOKING)
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
(GROANING)
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?

He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
ANNA:
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
RACHEL:
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
(PENCIL SCRIBBLING)
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He's a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...
Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett road.
- No.
- It was my first home.
We bought it together.
- It was ours.
-You didn't even like having him over.
I hated it.
Every day, I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No, it's...
Come.
It's all yours.
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!
Is it a... is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet.
How ol... how old is he?
- Six months.
- Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
Here.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
Down the center line, open, around and together...
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
Around and up.
But since moving here,
I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager... lover...
Waitress...
Gallery director...
Nanny... and...
A whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I...
Stay awake at night staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was...
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me want to get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Aw, daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
Oh.
Whew... ah...
- There.
-
-There you go.
Come here.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.
Oh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
- I mean, look at her.
Look at her.
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
-:
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
Mm.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just, this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this without child care, but...
You don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market...
It's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time...
As I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
I...
- Rachel.
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Oh.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Mm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
- You have to talk to her.
- I know.
I-I...
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop.
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Oh.
Shame.
Thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mm.
So did I.
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.
- I'll get right back to you.
Hey, tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish mama a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.
Jesus.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
- Relax.
Relax!
- Cathy, come on!
I just...
I just need some to go to sleep.
That's all.
I just need...
I just...
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for...
For a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
I've rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
Well, when we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
The next station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
-
-God, I wish
I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me,
I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer
-until they were together.
I know what they say, and you shouldn't check his e-mail.
It was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's, and my husband was fucking a century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd, and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
Oh, I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I...
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman...
Kissing someone else, just...
I... betraying her husband,
I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again, and... just thought if I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house and I'd go and...
Find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blond hair, and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back.
And then I'd pull it down to the ground, and I would just...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Move.
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
Uh, what the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You... you scared the shit out of Anna.
- Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She-she wanted to call the police, so just...
- Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my god.
God.
God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
- Okay?
I just...
- You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days one to 90, who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.
- Nice.
- There we go.
-Good job.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm-I'm Rachel and...
Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.
This is day one, I-I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I... because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had...
I had bruises all over my arm and, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned, when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's some time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Am I... am I right?
- Or am I nuts?
- No.
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.
That was a charity event.
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.
Right?
It was that, um, the homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, oh, safe shelter.
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?
Yup.
It was.
I can't.
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,
"and I can't wait because it's fun to dress up." Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
Uh, those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn?
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?
Rachel.
I'm fine, tom!
- Stop it.
- Come on.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
- That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk
- to me like that!
- Relax!
Relax!
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy.
I'm sorry.
- There you are.
- I need to get my shit together.
- I'm s...
- Shh.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm detective Riley.
This is detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I-I was at work in the city, and then... and then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
I...
So...
What'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean, she's missing?
Well, her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!
- Did you see her?
No, I don't...
I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I...
I-I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for, just tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
O-okay, okay.
I just, I-I got on the train, and then... and then I...
I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in long island...
Who blacked out.
He left a bar, drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning, oblivious to what he did until the police came to get him.
- Rachel!
- What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but, uh, not on Friday night.
She...
She was having an affair, she had a lover... that's what
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I s... but I saw her.
- You saw her where?
- I-I saw her from the train.
She was standing on-on the deck with this man.
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No, it wasn't him.
This... man was different, and th-they were...
They were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I-I know it sounds crazy.
Um...
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited, and that on one occasion you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men and the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive, jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett road
"and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards
"have been used since Friday.
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
And the cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I...
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...?
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So, you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife...
With someone...
On Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He-he was...
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
Uh, it could...
I-I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no, n...
Um, I haven't heard anything.
But you know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I, we took... we took yog...
We took Pilates... together.
I-I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time, and...
So sorry to have had to tell you...
Tell you that in that way and...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, ab...
Abdic...
Abdic.
Uh, Kamal...
Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me!
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
- Megan.
No!
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Meg...
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?
¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?
Ah, ah, sí.
¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?
Me estás volviendo...
¡Me estás volviendo loco!
¡me estás volviendo loco!
Dr. Kamal Abdic...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll... they'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...
- He's the one...
- He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I...
I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No, we j...
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
- Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh.
Come here.
Oh, you're heavy.
You're heavy.
- You're getting a little fatty.
- Rachel, no.
Anna, get in the house.
Your-your... your wife hit me on Friday night!
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No, that is not what happened.
She was... she was in the tunnel, and she-she hit me.
I don't want to argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
- How?
- To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan.
Rach...
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories.
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No, sorry, I-I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...
Sorry, I was just, uh, just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Mm...
Well, when I...
Wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done... it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed, that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
And you want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art.
I guess.
Good.
We can try to...
Regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
And we tried everything, and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my...
My heart, and...
So it got really sad.
And then, um... and then the-the booze just, uh, broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the...
Embodiment of...
True love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34.
1:37.
She calls again 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 P.M.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log of the calls;
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house
- since the incident with your child?
- Not that I know of.
Well, then you may have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah, I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and... and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so...
I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me.
Put her on my chest.
Her head just... under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I...
I couldn't look.
I didn't want to see it.
I didn't want to see it.
I wrapped her in a blanket, and I buried her.
And...
Mac went out that night... and he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
And I know this sounds...
Insane...
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel...
Give her to me.
Shh, shh, shh.
Oh.
Mommy's here.
- Shh.
Oh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Blunt force trauma, partially decomposed body found...
"Megan Hipwell, blunt force trauma,
"partially decomposed...
"The investigation now being called a homicide.
"Sources say the partially decomposed body found
"is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
"Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
- Mr. Hipwell!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
- She's dangerous, and you know it.
- Anna, Anna.
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How di... how did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know, I don't know what this is about...
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must've known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead.
And you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you, you know?
For getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic.
And I-I went to him to help you...
You're just a sad liar with no life.
- You're all liars.
- Please...
I need to file a statement.
Name.
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No, we-we were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...
You need the context...
I know the context, but what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you!
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
The next station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
Uh...
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
- And I-I know I saw you there.
- All right.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But-but what did you, what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right, you, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
- Was I, was I alone?
Was i... what happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa, take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
Uh...
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband,
I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
-I'd find her sitting and...
I'd smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha.
Martha.
Rachel?
Wow, I haven't seen you in a million years.
Um...
Yeah, I-I wanted to call you, um, but tom said I should just leave it alone.
- Oh.
- Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
And I just need you to know that I-I don't remember anything and, um,
I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink,
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh, with the eggs and then I-I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom... tom said that, um...
That I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
You want to lie down?
- Come with me.
- Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay tonight if you want.
- No, no.
That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then tom took you home.
- Sorry, tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
N-no.
No.
Yeah, tom got fired 'cause he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel.
Wake the fuck up!
- Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Oh, god.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just, I...
Well, come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here, okay?
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
Just need some help.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Just need to get a little help up.
- Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
- Come on.
Come on.
You're heavy.
Aw.
Come here.
Anna?
No.
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.
- There's... okay.
- Go!
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's tom?
He's lying to you.
He-he always does.
He's-he's a good liar...
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he-he killed Megan...
No, we don't, we don't know that.
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No.
No.
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie
- and you need to leave, get out of here.
- No.
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you... you know that deep down.
Anna, please,
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Now, listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!
Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So, were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
You... you were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom?
- Give her to me.
- That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom, give her to me, please?
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.
I think she needs changing, please.
No, she's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay.
Shh, shh.
- Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Shh.
You're okay, you're okay.
Shh, shh.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No, no.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train...
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So, what is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
This what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You were a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
Come on.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're... you're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
I can just... yeah.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And you can kick them.
They keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
You'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
Mm-hmm.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
No...
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would've killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would've killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
No!
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
Hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
I'll get right back to you.
Hey, Tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish Momma a happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Mom...
Rachel!
Jesus.
No, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
Okay?
I just...
You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
I've got 22 days back.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm Rachel and...
Welcome, Rachel.
Hi, Rachel.
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Thank you, Rachel.
Right?
It was that, um...
The homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter.
That was a tube top, right?
Yep, it was.
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.
"And I can't wait because it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled eggs.
Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your corn?
Rachel.
Put a couple on the wall...
Rachel!
I'm fine, Tom!
Stop it.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
Rachel.
You never fucking support me.
Rachel, please stop it!
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
Relax!
Rachel.
There you are.
Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
Is that correct?
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No, no.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body found.
"Megan Hipwell.
Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed.
"Investigation now being called a homicide.
"Sources say the partially decomposed body found
"is missing Ardsley woman, Megan Hipwell.
"Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
Please!
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
All right.
I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage,
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Oh.
Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, don't.
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did...
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Shh.
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
RACHEL:
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)
RACHEL:
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (CHUCKLING)No!
RACHEL:
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
WOMAN:
Are you alone?
RACHEL:
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
So sweet.
(BABY MOANING SOFTLY)
WOMAN:
Shh.
MEGAN:
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MEGAN:
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
ABDIC:
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
ABDIC:
Hmm.
With Mac.
ABDIC:
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
(SNIFFLES)
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
ABDIC:
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(SOFTLY) Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
(CHUCKLES)
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
(GRUNTS)
(IMITATES WHOOSHING)
There you go.
(EVIE COOS) MEGAN:
Shh, Shh, shh.
Ooh, hello. (CHUCKLES)
(COOS AND GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
(LAUGHS) Look at her!
(TELEPHONE RINGING) (ANNA GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) You're not sleeping!
MEGAN:
Hello?
(WHISPERING) You're not sleeping.
MEGAN:
Hello?
Hello?
(LINE DISCONNECTS)
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
ANNA:
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
lam.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
(KEYS JINGLE)
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
(SIGHS)
(KEYS JINGLE)
(EVIE CRYING) (GROANS)
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
TOM:
Hello?
(DOOR OPENS)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
(LAUGHING) Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.

Happy birthday, Mom...

No, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends. (CHUCKLES)
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
(CHUCKLES)
Get some sleep.
(SWITCH CLICKS)
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
TOM: (SOFTLY) It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
(TRAIN RUMBLING)
RACHEL:
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
(DRUM STICKS TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)
TOM:
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
RACHEL:
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
(SNIFFLES)
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
(SOBBING) It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!

What the hell is wrong with you?
(GROANS)
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
(TOM SCOFFS)
You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.

Oh, my God.

Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
Okay?
I just...
You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
(SNIFFLES)
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMING)
No!

Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count?
JASON:
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Welcome, Jason.
JASON:
I've got 22 days back.
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)
MAN:
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm Rachel and...
MAN 1:
Welcome, Rachel.
MAN 2:
Hi, Rachel.
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.
RACHEL:
Um...
I'm here because I...
Because I....
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm, um... (SNIFFLES)
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
(SOBBING) And there's time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
MAN:
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
ALL:
Thank you, Rachel.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
MARTHA:
Right?
It was that, um...
The homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
WOMAN:
Oh, Safe Shelter.
That was a tube top, right?
WOMAN:
Yep, it was.
MARTHA:
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.
"And I can't wait because it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.
RACHEL:
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled eggs.
MARTHA:
Thank you for making them.
(EXCLAIMING PLAYFULLY) (CHUCKLES)
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your corn?
TOM:
Rachel.
Put a couple on the wall... (GASPS) TOM:
Rachel!
I'm fine, Tom!
Stop it.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
Rachel.
You never fucking support me.
Rachel, please stop it!
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
Relax!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Rachel.
There you are.
Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
RILEY:
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
(STUTTERING) No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
CATHY:
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
(STAMMERING) I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
(STAMMERING)
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar... (VOICE FADING) ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
MEGAN:
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
(SNIFFLES)
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Except you.
ABDIC:
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
RACHEL: "Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
RACHEL:
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
(STAMMERING) I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
(STAMMERS)
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
Fuck!
(CLATTERING)
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
(CHUCKLES)
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kama Abdic.
ls that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL:
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
MEGAN:
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
(MEGAN MOANING)
Stay away from me.
MEGAN: (CRYING) This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Megan.
(SCREAMING)
Megan.
(MEGAN SNIFFLING)
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
RACHEL:
Dr. Kama!
Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
SCOTT:
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
ANNA:
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
(STUTTERING) Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
Is that correct?
RACHEL:
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
(CHUCKLES)
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
RACHEL:
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
RACHEL:
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
(SOBS)
(VOICE BREAKING) t just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
(SNIFFLING)
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
ANNA:
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
(SCOFFS)
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(DOOR OPENS)
(CHUCKLES)
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
(FOOTSTEPS)
(CLATTERING)
Hi.
SCOTT:
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
ABDIC:
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
(EXHALES)
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
(SNIFFLES)
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
(SOBBING) I loved her.
(SNIFFLES)
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
(CONTINUES SNIFFLING)
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The roof was leaking.
(WATER DRIPPING)
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
(CRYING) I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
(CHANDELIER JINGLING)
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDIC:
Who's Evie?
RACHEL:
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
ANNA:
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
(CRYING) ANNA:
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Shh.
RACHEL:
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.

(REPORTERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
(SNIFFLES)
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
(CHUCKLES)
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
You're just a sad liar with no life.
(GLASS SHATTERS) You're all liars.
Please!
(SOBBING)
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
(WATER RUNNING)
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
(SIGHS)
MEGAN:
I can still see her dark eyes-I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
ABDIC:
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
(WHISPERS) You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night tunneling I saw you there and...
All right. (STAMMERING) I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and... (SCREAMING)
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL:
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
(BRAKES SQUEAKING)
MARTHA: (LAUGHING) That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
MARTHA:
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
MARTHA:
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
TOM:
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
MARTHA:
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
TOM:
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
(DOOR LOCK CLICKING)
(DOOR OPENS)
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.

(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
ANNA:
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
(ANNA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
(DOOR OPENS)
Anna, don't.
TOM:
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
(EVIE CRYING)
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
TOM:
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
(EVIE CONTINUES CRYING) Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
(LINE RINGING)
FEMALE OPERATOR: 911, what's your...
(GASPS)
What's your emergency?
TOM:
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did... (DRINK POURING)
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
(SNIFFLES)
(GLASS SLIDING)
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
(GASPS)
(RACHEL COUGHS)
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
(EVIE MOANING) ANNA:
Shh.
(EVIE CRYING)
(FOOTSTEPS ECHOING)
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
TOM:
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
TOM:
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
(SIGHS)
What is it with you crazy women?
(MOANING)
ls that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
(LOCK RATTLING)
No!
(SHUSHING)
(CHOKING)
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
(GROANING)
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?

He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
ANNA:
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
RACHEL:
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
(PENCIL SCRIBBLING)
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
Synced and Corrected by Dan4Jem, AD.MMXVII.I
My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
No!
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
- Six months.
- Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
- Hmm.
- With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night, I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
Hello?
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mmm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
I'll get right back to you.
Hey, Tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish Momma a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Mom...
- Rachel!
Jesus.
No, no, no.
- No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
- Relax.
- Cathy, come on!
- Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?
- Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor, I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
- That sucks.
- It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
- Okay?
I just...
- You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
- Rachel!
- Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count?
- Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.
I've got 22 days back.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm Rachel and...
- Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Thank you, Rachel.
Right?
It was that, um...
The homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter.
That was a tube top, right?
Yep, it was.
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.
"And I can't wait because it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled eggs.
Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your corn?
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall...
Rachel!
I'm fine, Tom!
Stop it.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.
You never fucking support me.
Rachel, please stop it!
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.
- Don't fucking talk to me like that!
- Relax!
- Rachel.
There you are.
- Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
- Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!
- Did you see her?
- No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night.
- No.
What are you talking about?
- Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
- Unless you are.
- No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body found.
"Megan Hipwell.
Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed.
"Investigation now being called a homicide.
"Sources say the partially decomposed body found

"Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
- She's dangerous and you know it.
- Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
Please!
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
- All right.
- I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
- Oh.
- Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you wanna lie down?
- Come with me.
- Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

To replay this greeting, press one.
Hi, it's Megan.
Leave a message.
You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
- Don't touch me.
- You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Oh.
Anna?
- No.
Go away!
- Anna, please.
Please.
- There's...
Okay.
- Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
- Anna, he killed Megan.
- No, we don't...
We don't know that.
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.
- Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
- No.
No.
- You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
- No.
- Get out of here.
It's not safe.
- I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
- Anna, please, just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
- Anna, don't.
- Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
- Please give her to me.
- She's fine.
- I think she needs changing, please?
- She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
- Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did...
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Shh.
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
RACHEL:
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)
RACHEL:
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (CHUCKLING) No!
RACHEL:
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
WOMAN:
Are you alone?
RACHEL:
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
So sweet.
(BABY MOANING SOFTLY)
WOMAN:
Shh.
MEGAN:
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MEGAN:
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
ABDIC:
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
ABDIC:
Hmm.
With Mac.
ABDIC:
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
(SNIFFLES)
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
ABDIC:
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(SOFTLY) Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
(CHUCKLES)
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
(GRUNTS)
(IMITATES WHOOSHING)
There you go.
(EVIE COOS) MEGAN:
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello. (CHUCKLES)
(COOS AND GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
(LAUGHS) Look at her!
(TELEPHONE RINGING) (ANNA GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) You're not sleeping!
MEGAN:
Hello?
(WHISPERING) You're not sleeping.
MEGAN:
Hello?
Hello?
(LINE DISCONNECTS)
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
ANNA:
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
(KEYS JINGLE)
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
(SIGHS)
(KEYS JINGLE)
(EVIE CRYING) (GROANS)
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
TOM:
Hello?
(DOOR OPENS)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
(LAUGHING) Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.

Happy birthday, Mom...
CATHY:
Rachel!
Jesus.
No, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends. (CHUCKLES)
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
(CHUCKLES)
Get some sleep.
(SWITCH CLICKS)
IVF rarely works the first time.

We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.

I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?

TOM:
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
RACHEL:
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
(SNIFFLES)
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
(SOBBING) It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!

She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.

It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.

Rachel.
There you are.
Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
RILEY:
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
(STUTTERING) No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
CATHY:
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
(STAMMERING) I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
(STAMMERING)
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar... (VOICE FADING) ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
MEGAN:
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
(SNIFFLES)
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Except you.
ABDIC:
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
RACHEL: "Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared."
"No one has seen her since."
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday. "
"A wonderful woman,"
"an intensely private person with a warm heart."
"She lost a brother when she was 16,"
"and both her parents died a few years ago."
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information"
"to please come forward. "
You Megan's friend?
RACHEL:
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
(STAMMERING) I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
(STAMMERS)
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
Fuck!
(CLATTERING)
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
(CHUCKLES)
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL:
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
MEGAN:
Where are you?
MEGAN:
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

(MEGAN MOANING)

MEGAN: (CRYING) This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Megan.
(SCREAMING)
Megan.
(MEGAN SNIFFLING)
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
RACHEL:
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
SCOTT:
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
ANNA:
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
(STUTTERING) Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
Is that correct?
RACHEL:
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
(CHUCKLES)
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
RACHEL:
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
RACHEL:
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
(SOBS)
(VOICE BREAKING) It just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
(SNIFFLING)
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
ANNA:
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2: 15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
(SCOFFS)
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
ABDIC:
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
(EXHALES)
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
(SNIFFLES)
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
(SOBBING) I loved her.
(SNIFFLES)
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
(CONTINUES SNIFFLING)
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The roof was leaking.
(WATER DRIPPING)
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
(CRYING) I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
(CHANDELIER JINGLING)
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDIC:
Who's Evie?
RACHEL:
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
ANNA:
Rachel!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
(CRYING) ANNA:
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Shh.
RACHEL:
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.

I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.

Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.

What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
(CHUCKLES)
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
You're just a sad liar with no life.
(GLASS SHATTERS) You're all liars.
Please!
(SOBBING)
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
(WATER RUNNING)
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
(SIGHS)
MEGAN:
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
ABDIC:
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
(WHISPERS) You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
All right. (STAMMERING) I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd. "
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and... (SCREAMING)
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL:
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
(BRAKES SQUEAKING)
MARTHA: (LAUGHING) That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
MARTHA:
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
MARTHA:
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
TOM:
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
MARTHA:
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
TOM:
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
(DOOR LOCK CLICKING)
(DOOR OPENS)
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.

Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
ANNA:
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
(ANNA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
(DOOR OPENS)
Anna, don't.
TOM:
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
(EVIE CRYING)
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
TOM:
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
(EVIE CONTINUES CRYING) Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
(LINE RINGING)
FEMALE OPERATOR: 911, what's your...
(GASPS)
What's your emergency?
TOM:
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did... (DRINK POURING)
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
(SNIFFLES)
(GLASS SLIDING)
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
(GASPS)
(RACHEL COUGHS)
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
(EVIE MOANING) ANNA:
Shh.
(EVIE CRYING)
(FOOTSTEPS ECHOING)
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
TOM:
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
TOM:
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
(SIGHS)
What is it with you crazy women?
(MOANING)
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's play-dates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
(LOCK RATTLING)
No!
(SHUSHING)
(CHOKING)
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
(GROANING)
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?

I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
ANNA:
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
RACHEL:
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
(PENCIL SCRIBBLING)
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
No!
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
Hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
I'll get right back to you.
Hey, Tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish Momma a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Mom...
- Rachel!
Jesus.
No, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
Okay?
I just...
You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count?
- Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.
I've got 22 days back.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm Rachel and...
- Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Thank you, Rachel.
Right?
It was that, um...
The homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter.
That was a tube top, right?
Yep, it was.
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.
"And I can't wait because it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled eggs.
Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your corn?
Rachel.
Put a couple on the wall...
Rachel!
I'm fine, Tom!
Stop it.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
Rachel.
You never fucking support me.
Rachel, please stop it!
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
Relax!
Rachel.
There you are.
Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.

"Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body found.

Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed.
"Investigation now being called a homicide.

"Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
Please!
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
All right.
I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hi, it's Megan.

You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Oh.
Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
- Anna, don't.
- Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did...
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Shh.
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
RACHEL:
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)
RACHEL:
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
(MAN SPEAKING IN DISTINCTLY) (CHUCKLING) No!
RACHEL:
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
WOMAN:
Are you alone?
RACHEL:
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
So sweet.
(BABY MOANING SOFTLY)
WOMAN:
Shh.
MEGAN:
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MEGAN:
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
ABDIC:
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
ABDIC:
Hmm.
With Mac.
ABDIC:
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
(SNIFFLES)
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
ABDIC:
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(SOFTLY) Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
(CHUCKLES)
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
(GRUNTS)
(IMITATES WHOOSHING)
There you go.
(EVIE COOS) MEGAN:
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello. (CHUCKLES)
(COOS AND GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
(LAUGHS) Look at her!
(TELEPHONE RINGING) (ANNA GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) You're not sleeping!
MEGAN:
Hello?
(WHISPERING) You're not sleeping.
MEGAN:
Hello?
Hello?
(LINE DISCONNECTS)
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
ANNA:
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
(KEYS JINGLE)
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.

Rachel, what are you doing?
TOM:
Hello?
(DOOR OPENS)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
(LAUGHING) Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.

No, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends. (CHUCKLES)
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
(CHUCKLES)
Get some sleep.
(SWITCH CLICKS)
IVF rarely works the first time.

TOM: (SOFTLY) It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.

I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.

TOM:
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
RACHEL:
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
(SNIFFLES)
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
(SOBBING) It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!

She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.

It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.

RILEY:
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
(STUTTERING) No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
CATHY:
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
(STAMMERING) I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
(STAMMERING)
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar... (VOICE FADING) ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
MEGAN:
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
(SNIFFLES)
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Except you.
ABDIC:
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
RACHEL: "Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
RACHEL:
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
(STAMMERING) I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
(STAMMERS)
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
Fuck!
(CLATTERING)
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
(CHUCKLES)
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL:
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
MEGAN:
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
(MEGAN MOANING)

MEGAN: (CRYING) This is so stupid.

Where?

Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Megan.
(SCREAMING)
Megan.
(MEGAN SNIFFLING)
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.

Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
RACHEL:
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
SCOTT:
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
ANNA:
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
(STUTTERING) Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
Is that correct?
RACHEL:
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
(CHUCKLES)
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
RACHEL:
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
RACHEL:
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
(SOBS)
(VOICE BREAKING) It just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
(SNIFFLING)
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
ANNA:
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
(SCOFFS)
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

Hi.

(FOOTSTEPS)
(CLATTERING)
Hi.
SCOTT:
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
ABDIC:
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
(EXHALES)
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
(SNIFFLES)
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
(SOBBING) I loved her.
(SNIFFLES)
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
(CONTINUES SNIFFLING)
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The roof was leaking.
(WATER DRIPPING)
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
(CRYING) I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
(CHANDELIER JINGLING)
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDIC:
Who's Evie?
RACHEL:
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
ANNA:
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
(CRYING) ANNA:
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Shh.
RACHEL:
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.

(REPORTERS CHATTERING IN DISTINCTLY)
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
(SNIFFLES)
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
(CHUCKLES)
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
You're just a sad liar with no life.
(GLASS SHATTERS) You're all liars.
Please!
(SOBBING)
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
(WATER RUNNING)
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
(SIGHS)
MEGAN:
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
ABDIC:
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
(WHISPERS) You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...
All right. (STAMMERING) I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and... (SCREAMING)
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL:
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
(BRAKES SQUEAKING)
MARTHA: (LAUGHING) That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
MARTHA:
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
MARTHA:
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
TOM:
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
MARTHA:
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
TOM:
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
(DOOR LOCK CLICKING)

Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
(DOOR OPENS)
Anna, don't.
TOM:
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
(EVIE CRYING)
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
TOM:
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
(EVIE CONTINUES CRYING) Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.

Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did... (DRINK POURING)
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
(SNIFFLES)
(GLASS SLIDING)
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!

I just wanna go to the woods.
(SIGHS)
What is it with you crazy women?
(MOANING)
Is that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
(LOCK RATTLING)
No!
(SHUSHING)
(CHOKING)
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.

It was self-defense.

She was right about everything.

-About 17.
-Mm-hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me want to get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Aw, daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
Oh.
Whew... ah...
- There.

-There you go.
Come here.
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Oh, hello.

Or laundry.

I'm out all day tomorrow.
-That is so uncool.
-I hate to leave you like this without child care, but...
You don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market...
It's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time...
As I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
I...
- Rachel.
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Oh.
-Thank you.

Mm.

How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.

I will.
I know, I know, I know.
-Okay.

Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
--Stop.
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
-No, I like it at home.
-Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Oh.
Shame.
Thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mm.
So did I.
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.

Hey, tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish mama a happy birthday.

No, don't, Cathy.

I just need...
I just...
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.

-It was a cute picture.
-Yeah?
Yup.

I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that i would just be here for...
For a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.

I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman...
Kissing someone else, just...
I... betraying her husband,
I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again, and... just thought if I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house and I'd go and...
Find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blond hair, and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back.
And then I'd pull it down to the ground, and I would just...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Move.
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
Uh, what the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You... you scared the shit out of Anna.
- Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She-she wanted to call the police, so just...
- Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my god.
God.
God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
-Okay?
I just...
-You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
--Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- You whore!
No!
Anyonecountingdays oneto90 , who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
-I've got 22 days back.
-Nice.
-There we go.
-Good job.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm-I'm Rachel and...
Welcome, Rachel.
Hi, Rachel.
-And this... thank you.
This is day one, i-i suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I because I...
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had...
I had bruises all over my arm and, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned, when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's some time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Am I... am I right?
- Or am I nuts?
- No.
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.
That was a charity event.
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.
Right?
It was that, um, the homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, oh, safe shelter.
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?
Yup.
It was.
I can't.
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,
"and I can't wait because it's fun to dress up." Then dress up.
Doyoulike devil'seggs,Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
-Deviled egg.
-Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
Uh, those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn?
Rachel.
-Put a couple on the wall?
Rachel.
I'm fine, tom!
-Stop it.
-Come on.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
- That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
-I'm your wife and you never...
-Rachel.
-You never fucking support me.
-Rachel, please stop it.
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.
Don'tfuckingtalk
-to me like that!
-Relax!
Relax!
-Rachel.
-Hi, Cathy.
I'm sorry.
-There you are.
-I need to get my shit together.
-I'm s...
-Shh.
You must be Ms. Watson.
--I'm detective Riley.
This is detective gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I-i was at work in the city, and then and then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at ardsley-on-Hudson, and then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
I...
So...
What'd you do during those hours in ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean, she's missing?
Well, her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was just...
Do you know Megan hipwell?
-No!
-Did you see her?
No, I don't...
I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I...
I-i ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for, just tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
O-okay, okay.
I just, i-i got on the train, and then... and then I...
I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in long island...
Who blacked out.
He left a bar, drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
Hewokeup thenextmorning, oblivious to what he did until the police cametogethim .
-Rachel!
-What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
-I'll give you a few weeks...
-Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
-Yeah, I agree with you.
-Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan hipwell, but, uh, not on Friday night.
She...
She was having an affair, she had a lover-- that's what
-I'm trying to tell you.
-I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I s... but I saw her.
-You saw her where?
-I-i saw her from the train.
She was standing on-on the deck with this man.
-With her husband, Scott hipwell?
-No, it wasn't him.
This... man was different, and th-they were...
They were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I-i know it sounds crazy.
Um...
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited, and that on one occasion you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
Youknow,Ilie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but i have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men and the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive, jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?

You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
-Do you want a coffee?
-Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
And the cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I...
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...?
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So, you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife...
With someone...
On Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
--I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He-he was...
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
Uh, it could-- i-i don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no, n...
Um, I haven't heard anything.
But you know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I, we took... we took yog...
We took pilates... together.
I-i think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time, and...
So sorry to have had to tell you...
Tell you that in that way and...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, ab...
Abdic... abdic.
Uh, kamal... abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That'shim.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me!
Thisisso stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
- Megan.
No!
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Meg...
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...

Justnotquiteyet .
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
-What?
-There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll... they'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
-The police think I did it.
-Yeah, but he's...
-He's the one...
-He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, i...
I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No, we j...
We just need to find more evidence on abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting abdic myself.
- Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh.
Come here.
Oh, you're heavy.
You're heavy.
-You're getting a little fatty.
-Rachel, no.
Anna, get in the house.
Your-your... your wife hit me on Friday night!
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No, that is not what happened.
She was... she was in the tunnel, and she-she hit me.
I don't want to argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
-Let's start with child abduction.
-That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
-How?
-To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan.
Rach...
I don't think you're helping anybody.
Soyou'rehere becauseyouwant to uncover lost memories.
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No, sorry, i-i, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
-Unless you are.
-No, no, I...
Sorry, I was just, uh, just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Mm...
Well, when I...
Wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed, that I have a i just don't feel bad enough.
And you want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art.
I guess.
Good.
We can try to...
Regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
And we tried everything, and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my...
My heart, and...
So it got really sad.
And then, um and then the-the booze just, uh, broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the...
Embodiment of...
True love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July5th.
1:33and1: 34.
1:37.
She calls again 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 P.M.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
-Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
-You have a log of the calls;
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house
-since the incident with your child?
-Not that I know of.
Well, then you may have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She has been hanging around Scott hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah, I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
--Hi.
- Hey.
-Hi.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
Youshouldn'tbe here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and... and left.
Theroofwasleaking.
Itwasfreezingcold,so...
Igotin thetub .

I let her go.
I let her go.
I...
Icouldn'tlook.
Ididn'twanttoseeit.
Ididn'twant toseeit .
I wrapped her in a blanket, and I buried her.
And...
Mac went out that night and he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
Idecidedto go there.
Thefrontdoorwas open;

- Mr. hipwell!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
-She's dangerous, and you know it.
-Anna, Anna.
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How di-- how did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know, I don't know what this is about...
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must've known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead.
And you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
-Who does this?
-I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you, you know?
For getting abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about abdic.
And i-i went to him to help you...
You're just a sad liar with no life.
-You're all liars.
-Please...
I need to file a statement.
Name.
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott hipwell?
No, we-we were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight
-at your apartment, right?
-No, you-you...
You need the context...
I know the context, but what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you!
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
Icanstillsee her darkeyes .
Icansmellher skin.
Icanfeelhow coldshewas.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
The next station is ardsley-on-Hudson.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
Uh...
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
-And i-i know I saw you there.
-All right.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But-but what did you, what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right, you, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
- Was I, was I alone?
Was i-- what happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa, take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
Uh...
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband,
Ifeltit .
Purerage.
IfI could, I'dgoto herhouse,
-I'dfindhersittingand...

That's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha.
Martha.
Rachel?
Wow, I haven't seen you in a million years.
Um...
Yeah, i-i wanted to call you, um, but tom said I should just leave it alone.
-Oh.
-Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
And I just need you to know that i-i don't remember anything and, um,
I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink,

I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom... tom said that, um...
That I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.

Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?

And then tom took you home.
-Sorry, tom...
-Stop fucking saying that!
-I know you're sorry!
-Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
N-no.
No.
Yeah, tom got fired 'cause he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wakethefuckup, Rachel.

Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here, okay?
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.

Don't touch me.
Just need to get a little help up.

-Go!
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's tom?
He's lying to you.
He-he always does.
He's-he's a good liar...
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he-he killed Megan...
No, we don't, we don't know that.
-He's dangerous.
-We don't know anything.
-Anna, you-you need to leave.
-No.
No.
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie
-and you need to leave, get out of here.
-No.
-It's not safe...
-I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you... you know that deep down.
Anna, please,
-just come with me.
-I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
-Anna, don't, don't...
-Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Now, listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
-Did Megan get in your car?
-No!
Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So, were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
You... you were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom?
-Give her to me.
-That's right.
Your daddy loves you.
Tom, give her to me, please?
-Please give her to me.
-It's fine.
I think she needs changing, please.
No, she's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay.
Shh, shh.
-Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
-Change her here.
-Change her here.
-You're-- okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
- Shh.
You're okay, you're okay.
Shh, shh.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No, no.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things-- i didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train...
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So, what is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
This what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You were a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
Come on.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're... you're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
I can just... yeah.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And you can kick them.
They keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
Mm-hmm.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
--No...
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would've killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would've killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.

The Girl on the Train
Subtitle by Bambula
My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house:
Number 15 Beckett Road...
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago and, gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me...
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be...
I imagine she's a painter...
She's creative.
He's a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is "Jess, " tomorrow it could be "Lisa" or "Amber."
It all depends on the day, it depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love...
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person...
I used to live two doors down... number 13 Beckett Road.
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day, I tell myself not to look.
But then I look...
Are you alone?
-Yeah.
No, come.
It's all yours.
Your baby's so cute.
-Thank you.
-Hi, baby.
Is it...
Is it a boy?
-Yeah.
So sweet.
How... how old is he?
-Six months.
-Six months.
So sweet.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention...
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here I've come to understand it... 6 MONTHS AGO
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I've been:
rebellious teenager, lover, waitress... gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about seventeen.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died...
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes, I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless, make me wanna get pregnant...
And that's not the case?
When I finish work, every night I run home, and I get in the shower and wash the smell of that baby off me as fast as I can.
ANNA
TODAY
When you woke up this morning I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
"Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday dear Anna, Happy Birthday to you!"
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Oh, hello.
I swear I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
-You're not sleeping...
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
And grab the corners.
And straighten.
-I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here...
I am.
It's just this isn't what I "do."
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery head-hunted me.
That's great.
-The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this, without childcare, but, you don't have a job.
Ok, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
-It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmer's market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes.
And I do all of this at the same time as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work, it's actually better for the kid.
-How would you know?
Your key.
There is no job more important than raising a child...
Megan, please...
Rachel?
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
!
Hello?
Thank you.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
-She called the landline three times.
You have to talk to her.
-I know.
It's getting crazy.
-I will.
I know I know I know.
-Okay.
It's going to be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
You sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
-Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
-She just told me she got another job.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
So did I.
RACHEL
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
Hey, Tom, it's me.
I just wanted to wish Momma happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Momma.
-Rachel!
Jesus...
No no no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it!
-Relax.
-Cathy, come on!
-Relax.
I just need something to go to sleep.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
-Yeah?
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
-Alright.
I'll just get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them.
Okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or a month.
Yeah.
That was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at...
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs.
Holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of emails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say: "You shouldn't check his email."
I was stupid.
But when I saw it was from the realtor
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses not Xs and my husband was fucking a Century 21 Agent.
That sucks.
-It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd", but just yell it.
-Right.
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house!
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail, but this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else...
I...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
Like something has been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house.
And I'd go in and find her sitting at the kitchen table.
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and jerk her head back.
Just jerk it back!
And then I'd pull her down to the ground and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I've spent the past hour driving around looking for you!
You scared the shit out of Anna, do you know that?
She thought you were going to...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone!
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you any more.
Oh my god...
Rachel, open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
-Are you ok?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu, okay?
-You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid...
Rachel!
-Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
Anyone counting days one to ninety who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason, I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
-I've got twenty-two days back.
Anyone else?
Hi, I'm Rachel, and...
-Welcome, Rachel.
This is day one, I suppose.
I'm here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm and...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone has helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned that when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's... time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
It was that homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter...
-Yeah.
-That was a tube top, right?
-Yeah, it was.
Do you like Devil's Eggs, Martha?
-Deviled Eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled Eggs.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
-Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want.
Or do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn, and a couple on the wall!
Rachel!
-I'm fine, Tom.
Stop it!
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
-That's my boss's wife.
You probably got me fired back there.
-I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
-Rachel!
-You never fucking support me!
Please stop.
Hey, come on.
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
-Relax!
Rachel, there you are.
-Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
I'm...
You must be Miss Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
-Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city.
And then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
-You mean your EX-husband?
Yes.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson.
And then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
-And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
-So...
What did you do during those hours in Ardsley if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
-What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was...
-Do you know Megan Hipwell?
-No.
-Did you see her?
No.
I don't think so.
-Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in Public Relations?
Right.
-It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem?
Ok.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent...
If you don't have a job, then what do you do everyday?
-I...
I ride the train.
-You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel!
-Okay.
Okay.
I got on the train.
And then, I got off the train.
I don't know!
It's very unclear...
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar and drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
-What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks.
-Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
-Yeah, I agree with you, but...
-Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
-You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
-No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different.
And they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy, but...
-Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited.
And that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
-Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
4 MONTHS AGO
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean I know that's not the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the Exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows...
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kinda sexy.
So, when I came home last night, Scott was on my laptop wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care.
And I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
Almost exactly a week ago, Megan Hipwell walked out of Number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
No one has seen her since.
Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday.
Ardsley Woman Still Missing
A wonderful woman.
An intensely private person with a warm heart.
She lost a brother when she was sixteen, and both her parents died a few years ago.
Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information to please come forward.
You're Megan's friend?
-Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
-Sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
-I don't think so.
And you know Megan from?
-From the gallery.
Are you an artist?
-Well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone, you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife with someone, on Friday morning.
-With who?
She was up there on your porch.
I saw her from the train because I commute to Manhattan everyday and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
No, no, no.
Thank you.
OK.
Sure.
It could, I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing?
It could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
-Right.
She talked to you?
-Oh no.
I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby...
She and I, we took yoga...
We took pilates together.
I think I should go, I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way.
Do you think you'd recognize him again?
If you saw him?
I don't know.
There was a guy, a therapist.
His name's Abdic.
Abdic.
Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
I remember...
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
-Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't...
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a fuck...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist...
For the first time in ages I have purpose.
Or at least, I have a distraction...
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
SCOTT:
We need to meet ASAP
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
-Abdic's been released.
What?
!
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him, it'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
-Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
-The police think I did it.
-Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable, that I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out...
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake, and got drunk.
-No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no emails, there's nothing, no letters, no emails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself...
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
You're heavy.
You're a fatty.
You're a little fatty.
Rachel?
No.
Anna, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night!
What are you talking about?
-Yes.
Yes, she did.
Yes, you did.
And then she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
-No.
That is not what happened!
She was in the tunnel.
And she hit me.
I won't argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
I'm not drunk, Tom!
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not... how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
You were just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
!
-Because I'm helping him.
-How?
To try and find Megan.
-You don't even know Megan!
Rach.
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories.
Is that correct?
-You have an accent.
Pardon?
-Sorry.
I wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
-I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless, you are...
-No.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it.
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
-So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
Have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
Do you want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart.
So I got really sad and then...
The booze just broke us.
Okay.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then, she betrayed him.
And it's sparked something in me...
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th: 1:33, 1:34, 1:37...
She calls again 1:38 and then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 PM.
And then July 6th...
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
-Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know.
-Well, then you might have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She's been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you can bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence?
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

Hi.
Hi.
-Reporters are in my yard.
Everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family, but she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
1 MONTH AGO
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone, just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone, I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was seventeen.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
I called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We'd gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
I was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest,
her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't want to see it.
I didn't want to see her.
I wrapped her in a blanket.
And I buried her.
Then...
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day when I was drunk, I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane, but I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel?
What are you doing?
!
What are you doing?
Rachel...
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
Partially decomposed body found...
Female body found...
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body.
Megan Hipwell.
Investigation now being called a homicide.
Sources say the partially decomposed body found is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide.
Mr. Hipwell?
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
-Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
!
I saw her again today.
-Where?
This afternoon when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna, sweetheart, Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about...
-Come on!
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
-Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife!
The Detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable?
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help.
You're Tom's crazy ex!
When the fuck were you going to tell me that?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
!
You?
!
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead, and you're lying to me!
?
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
-I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Well, thank you, you know.
For getting Abdic to point the finger at me!
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know?
The sessions?
With the doctor?
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
-Please, dont!
I need to file a statement.
-Name?
-Rachel Watson.
-Pete?
I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
You need the context.
-I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point?
I met him after...
-After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No.
He didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know...
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
LAST FRIDAY
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
I know I saw you there!
-Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off.
So, I fucked off.
-Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
!
-I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
-I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God...
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband.
I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house, find her sitting... and I'd smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
It's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha?
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years...
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
I just need you to know that I don't remember anything and I just completely blacked out...
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so...
It's okay.
-I know, but with the eggs...
And then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive.
I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
I don't...
Tom...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you want to lie down?
Come with me.
Excuse us...
Rachel?
Are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
-No, no.
That's fine.
Thanks.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene...
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom...
-Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry.
-I'm sorry.
-What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
You can't even fucking stand up.
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No...
No...
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
Such a bad guy.
God.
Are you okay?
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3.
I'm here, where are you?
I can't.
Stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
-I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
-Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Come here.
-Anna.
No, no.
-Anna, please.
-Go away.
Go.
-I'm just going to stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
-I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
-I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you...
-I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna...
He killed Megan.
-No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
-We don't know anything!
Anna, you need to leave.
-No.
-You need to leave.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
-No.
-Get out of here.
-I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you know that, deep down.
Anna, please just come with me.
-I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, dont.
Dont!
Please.
-Come in the house, honey.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker, I saw you!
You murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her, I know it!
You're un-fucking-believable.
Now listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
-No!
-Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel, because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls.
They weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here, working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
!
You were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Tom, give her to me.
-It's all right.
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
I think she needs changing.
Please?
-It's gonna be fine.
-Please just give her to me.
Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
-Change her here.
Okay, I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No no, stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things.
I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But, I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
-Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You want to get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
What is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is this what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
-I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
-Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not then...
Get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
-I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
-I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna because you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore!
And you fucked me because you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
You can kick them, but they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
You'll love them.
-This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible.
Because I am not the girl I used to be.
Subtitle by Bambula
The Girl on the Train
Subtitle by Bambula
My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house:
Number 15 Beckett Road...
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago and, gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me...
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be...
I imagine she's a painter...
She's creative.
He's a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is "Jess, " tomorrow it could be "Lisa" or "Amber."
It all depends on the day, it depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love...
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person...
I used to live two doors down... number 13 Beckett Road.
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day, I tell myself not to look.
But then I look...
Are you alone?
- Yeah.
No, come.
It's all yours.
Your baby's so cute.
- Thank you.
-Hi, baby.
Is it...
Is it a boy?
- Yeah.
So sweet.
How... how old is he?
- Six months.
-Six months.
So sweet.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention...
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here I've come to understand it... 6 MONTHS AGO
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I've been:
rebellious teenager, lover, waitress... gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about seventeen.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died...
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes, I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless, make me wanna get pregnant...
And that's not the case?
When I finish work, every night I run home, and I get in the shower and wash the smell of that baby off me as fast as I can.
ANNA
TODAY
When you woke up this morning I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
"Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday dear Anna, Happy Birthday to you!"
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Oh, hello.
I swear I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
-You're not sleeping...
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
And grab the corners.
And straighten.
- I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here...
I am.
It's just this isn't what I "do."
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery head-hunted me.
That's great.
- The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this, without childcare, but, you don't have a job.
Ok, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
- It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmer's market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes.
And I do all of this at the same time as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work, it's actually better for the kid.
-How would you know?
Your key.
There is no job more important than raising a child...
Megan, please...
Rachel?
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
!
Hello?
Thank you.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
-She called the landline three times.
You have to talk to her.
- I know.
It's getting crazy.
- I will.
I know I know I know.
-Okay.
It's going to be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
You sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
- She just told me she got another job.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
So did I.
RACHEL
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
Hey, Tom, it's me.
I just wanted to wish Momma happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Momma.
- Rachel!
Jesus...
No no no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it!
-Relax.
-Cathy, come on!
-Relax.
I just need something to go to sleep.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
- Alright.
I'll just get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them.
Okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or a month.
Yeah.
That was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at...
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs.
Holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of emails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
"You shouldn't check his email."
I was stupid.
But when I saw it was from the realtor
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses not Xs and my husband was fucking a Century 21 Agent.
That sucks.
-It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd", but just yell it.
-Right.
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house!
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail, but this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else...
I...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
Like something has been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house.
And I'd go in and find her sitting at the kitchen table.
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and jerk her head back.
Just jerk it back!
And then I'd pull her down to the ground and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I've spent the past hour driving around looking for you!
You scared the shit out of Anna, do you know that?
She thought you were going to...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone!
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you any more.
Oh my god...
Rachel, open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
- Are you ok?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu, okay?
-You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid...
Rachel!
- Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
Anyone counting days one to ninety who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason, I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
- I've got twenty-two days back.
Anyone else?
Hi, I'm Rachel, and...
- Welcome, Rachel.
This is day one, I suppose.
I'm here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm and...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone has helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned that when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's... time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
It was that homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter...
-Yeah.
-That was a tube top, right?
-Yeah, it was.
Do you like Devil's Eggs, Martha?
- Deviled Eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled Eggs.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
-Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want.
Or do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn, and a couple on the wall!
Rachel!
- I'm fine, Tom.
Stop it!
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
- That's my boss's wife.
You probably got me fired back there.
- I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel!
-You never fucking support me!
Please stop.
Hey, come on.
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
- Relax!
Rachel, there you are.
-Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
I'm...
You must be Miss Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
- Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city.
And then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
- You mean your EX-husband?
Yes.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson.
And then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
-And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
- So...
What did you do during those hours in Ardsley if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
- What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was...
-Do you know Megan Hipwell?
-No.
-Did you see her?
No.
I don't think so.
-Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in Public Relations?
Right.
-It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem?
Ok.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent...
If you don't have a job, then what do you do everyday?
-I...
I ride the train.
- You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel!
-Okay.
Okay.
I got on the train.
And then, I got off the train.
I don't know!
It's very unclear...
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar and drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
-What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks.
-Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
-Yeah, I agree with you, but...
-Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
- You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different.
And they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy, but...
- Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited.
And that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
-Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
4 MONTHS AGO
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean I know that's not the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the Exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows...
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kinda sexy.
So, when I came home last night, Scott was on my laptop wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care.
And I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
Almost exactly a week ago, Megan Hipwell walked out of Number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
No one has seen her since.
Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday.
Ardsley Woman Still Missing
A wonderful woman.
An intensely private person with a warm heart.
She lost a brother when she was sixteen, and both her parents died a few years ago.
Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information to please come forward.
You're Megan's friend?
- Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
- Sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
- I don't think so.
And you know Megan from?
- From the gallery.
Are you an artist?
- Well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone, you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife with someone, on Friday morning.
-With who?
She was up there on your porch.
I saw her from the train because I commute to Manhattan everyday and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
No, no, no.
Thank you.
OK.
Sure.
It could, I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing?
It could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
- Right.
She talked to you?
- Oh no.
I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby...
She and I, we took yoga...
We took pilates together.
I think I should go, I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way.
Do you think you'd recognize him again?
If you saw him?
I don't know.
There was a guy, a therapist.
His name's Abdic.
Abdic.
Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
I remember...
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
- Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't...
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a fuck...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist...
For the first time in ages I have purpose.
Or at least, I have a distraction...
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
We need to meet ASAP
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
- Abdic's been released.
What?
!
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him, it'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
-Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
-The police think I did it.
-Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable, that I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out...
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake, and got drunk.
-No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no emails, there's nothing, no letters, no emails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself...
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
You're heavy.
You're a fatty.
You're a little fatty.
Rachel?
No.
Anna, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night!
What are you talking about?
- Yes.
Yes, she did.
Yes, you did.
And then she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
-No.
That is not what happened!
She was in the tunnel.
And she hit me.
I won't argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
I'm not drunk, Tom!
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not... how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
You were just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
!
-Because I'm helping him.
-How?
To try and find Megan.
- You don't even know Megan!
Rach.
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories.
Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
-Sorry.
I wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
- I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless, you are...
- No.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it.
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
Have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
Do you want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart.
So I got really sad and then...
The booze just broke us.
Okay.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then, she betrayed him.
And it's sparked something in me...
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
1:33, 1:34, 1:37...
She calls again 1:38 and then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And then July 6th...
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
-Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know.
-Well, then you might have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She's been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you can bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence?
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

Hi.
Hi.
-Reporters are in my yard.
Everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family, but she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
1 MONTH AGO
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone, just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone, I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was seventeen.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
I called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We'd gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
I was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest,
her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't want to see it.
I didn't want to see her.
I wrapped her in a blanket.
And I buried her.
Then...
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day when I was drunk, I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane, but I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel?
What are you doing?
!
What are you doing?
Rachel...
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
Partially decomposed body found...
Female body found...
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body.
Megan Hipwell.
Investigation now being called a homicide.
Sources say the partially decomposed body found is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide.
Mr. Hipwell?
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
- Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
!
I saw her again today.
- Where?
This afternoon when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna, sweetheart, Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about...
-Come on!
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
- Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife!
The Detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable?
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help.
You're Tom's crazy ex!
When the fuck were you going to tell me that?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
!
You?
!
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead, and you're lying to me!
?
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
-I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Well, thank you, you know.
For getting Abdic to point the finger at me!
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know?
The sessions?
With the doctor?
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
- Please, dont!
I need to file a statement.
- Name?
-Rachel Watson.
-Pete?
I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
You need the context.
- I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point?
I met him after...
- After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No.
He didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know...
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
LAST FRIDAY
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
I know I saw you there!
- Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off.
So, I fucked off.
-Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
!
- I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
-I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God...
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband.
I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house, find her sitting... and I'd smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
It's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha?
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years...
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
I just need you to know that I don't remember anything and I just completely blacked out...
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so...
It's okay.
-I know, but with the eggs...
And then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive.
I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
I don't...
Tom...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you want to lie down?
Come with me.
Excuse us...
Rachel?
Are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
-No, no.
That's fine.
Thanks.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene...
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry.
-I'm sorry.
- What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
You can't even fucking stand up.
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No...
No...
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
Such a bad guy.
God.
Are you okay?
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3.
I'm here, where are you?
I can't.
Stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hi, it's Megan.
Leave a message.
You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
-I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
-Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Come here.
- Anna.
No, no.
-Anna, please.
- Go away.
Go.
-I'm just going to stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
-I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
-I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you...
- I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna...
He killed Megan.
- No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything!
Anna, you need to leave.
-No.
-You need to leave.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
- No.
-Get out of here.
-I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you know that, deep down.
Anna, please just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, dont.
Dont!
Please.
- Come in the house, honey.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker, I saw you!
You murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her, I know it!
You're un-fucking-believable.
Now listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
-No!
-Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel, because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls.
They weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here, working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
!
You were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Tom, give her to me.
- It's all right.
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
I think she needs changing.
Please?
-It's gonna be fine.
-Please just give her to me.
Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.
Okay, I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No no, stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things.
I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But, I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
-Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You want to get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
What is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is this what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
- I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
- Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not then...
Get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
- I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
-I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna because you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore!
And you fucked me because you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
You can kick them, but they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
You'll love them.
-This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible.
Because I am not the girl I used to be.

(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)
RACHEL:
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)
RACHEL:
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (CHUCKUNG)Nm
RACHEL:
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
WOMAN:
Are you alone?
RACHEL:
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
So sweet.
(BABY MOANING SOFTLY)
WOMAN:
Shh.
MEGAN:
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
MEGAN:
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
ABDIC:
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
ABDIC:
Hmm.
With Mac.
ABDICI Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac: and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
(SNIFFLES)
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
ABDIC:
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(SOFTLY) Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
(CHUCKLES)
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
(GRUNTS)
(IMITATES WHOOSHING)
There you go.
(EVIE COOS) MEGAN:
Shh, shh, shh.
Ooh, hello. (CHUCKLES)
(COOS AND GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
(LAUGHS) Look at her!
(TELEPHONE RINGING) (ANNA GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) You're not sleeping!
MEGAN:
Hello?
(WHISPERING) You're not sleeping.
MEGAN:
Hello?
Hello?
(LINE DISCONNECTS)
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
ANNA:
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
I am.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
(KEYS JINGLE)
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.

Hello?

Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
(LAUGHING) Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got anotherjob.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.

No,no,no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
(CHUCKLES)
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
(CHUCKLES)
Get some sleep.

Who is that man?

She's throwing it all away.
(DRUM STICKS TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)
TOM".
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
RACHEL:
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
(SNIFFLES)
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
When I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
(SOBBING) It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd justjerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!

I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.

You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.

It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.

RILEY:
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6200.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
(STUTTERING) No, I don't think so.
Isthatbecause you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
CATHY:
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
(STAMMERING) I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, Okay-
(STAMMERING)
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar... (VOICE FADING) ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
MEGAN:
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, butlhaveto keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
(SNIFFLES)
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Except you.
ABDIC:
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
RACHEL: "Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
RACHEL:
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
(STAMMERING) I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
(STAMMERS)
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
Fuck!
(CLATTERING)
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
(CHUCKLES)
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
RACHEL'.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
MEGAN:
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
(MEGAN MOANING)
Stay away from me.
MEGAN: (CRYING) This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Megan.
(SCREAMING)
Megan.
(MEGAN SNIFFLING)
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
RACHEL:
Dr. Kama!
Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
SCOTT:
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
InevercaHed to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, lthoughtabout contacting Abdic: myself.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
ANNA:
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
(STUTTERING) Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rash ,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
Is that correct?
RACHEL:
You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
(CHUCKLES)
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
RACHEL:
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
RACHEL:
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
(SOBS)
(VOICE BREAKING) ltjust broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
(SNIFFLING)
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
ANNA:
July 5th.
1.'33 and 1.'34, 1.'37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
(SCOFFS)
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

(FOOTSTEPS)
(CLATTERING)
Hi.
SCOTT:
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
ABDIC:
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
(EXHALES)
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
(SNIFFLES) it was easy.
Because I loved her.
(SOBBING) I loved her.
(SNIFFLES)
We called her Elizabeth.
(BREATH TREMBLING)
Libby.
(CONTINUES SNIFFLING)
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The roof was leaking.
(WATER DRIPPING)
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
(CRYING) I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
(CHANDELIER JINGLING)
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
ABDK)'.
Who's Evie?
RACHEL:
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
ANNA:
Rachel!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
(CRYING) ANNA:
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Shh.
RACHEL:
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.

What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott baok home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
(SNIFFLES)
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
(CHUCKLES)
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestlyjust trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You'?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
You're just a sad liar with no life.
(GLASS SHATTERS) You're all liars.
Please!
(sesame)
God.
Ineedto file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
(WATER RUNNING)
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't aooount for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
(SIGHS)
MEGAN:
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
ABDIC:
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
(WHISPERS) You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night inthetunneL I saw you there and...
All right.
(STAMMERING) I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
Vvhathappened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
RACHEL:
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
RACHEL:
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage,
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and... (SCREAMING)
Smash her head all over the floor!
RACHEL".
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
(BRAKES SQUEAKING)
MARTHA: (LAUGHING) That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
MARTHA:
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
MARTHA:
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
TOM:
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
MARTHA:
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh,God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
TOM:
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.

I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.

I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.

Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
(EVIE CRYING)
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
TOM:
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
(EVIE CONTINUES CRYING) Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.

You made me think that everything was my fault.

Is that what you want?

What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Becauselthought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.

You're not gonna get rid of me.

You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.

(PENCIL SCRIBBLING)
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house.
Number 15 Beckett Road.
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me.
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be.
I imagine she's a painter.
She's creative.
He is a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today, her name is Jess.
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love.
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person.
I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road.
No!
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day I tell myself not to look.
But then I look.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
No.
Come.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, baby!
Is it a boy?
Yeah!
So sweet!
How old is he?
Six months.
Six months.
So sweet.
Shh.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention.
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here, I've come to understand it.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I wanna start my life over again.
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about 17.
Hmm.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died.
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.
Make me wanna get pregnant.
And that's not the case?
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.
Ah.
When you woke up this morning,
I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Anna
Happy birthday to you
Oh.
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Shh, Shh, shh.
Ooh, hello.
I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
You're not sleeping.
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.
And grab the corners.
And straight.
I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.
lam.
It's just this isn't what I do.
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery headhunted me.
That's great.
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job.
Okay, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time
as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.
And how would you know?
Your key.
There's no job more important than raising a child.
Megan, please.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hello?
Thank you.
Hmm.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
She called the landline three times.
Oh.
You have to talk to her.
I know.
It's getting crazy.
I will.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Stop!
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
She just told me she got another job.
Huh.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
Mmm.
So did I.
Hey, it's Tom-Sorry I missed you.
I'll get right back to you.
Hey, Tom.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to wish Momma a happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Mom...
- Rachel!
Jesus.
No, no, no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.
Relax.
Cathy, come on!
Relax!
I just need some to go to sleep, that's all.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
Yeah?
Yup.
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
All right.
Let's get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months.
Yeah, that was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at.
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.
I was stupid.
But when I, um...
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's.
And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent.
That sucks.
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right?
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just wanna tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house.
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.
But this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
It was like something had been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.
I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
Hey!
Hey!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I spent the past hour driving around looking for you.
You scared the shit out of Anna.
Do you know that?
She thought you were gonna...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone.
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.
Oh, my God.
Rachel?
Open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
Are you okay?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu.
Okay?
I just...
You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid!
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
No!
Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count?
- Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.
I've got 22 days back.
Anyone else?
Hi.
I'm Rachel and...
- Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.
Um...
I'm here because I...
Because I....
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm, um...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Thank you, Rachel.
Right?
It was that, um...
The homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter.
That was a tube top, right?
Yep, it was.
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.
"And I can't wait because it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?
Deviled eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled eggs.
Thank you for making them.
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to.
Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your corn?
Rachel.
Put a couple on the wall...
Rachel!
I'm fine, Tom!
Stop it.
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
That's my boss's wife.
Probably got me fired back there.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
Rachel.
You never fucking support me.
Rachel, please stop it!
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
Relax!
Rachel.
There you are.
Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
You must be Ms. Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
Wanna sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city, and then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
You mean your ex-husband?
Yeah.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
No!
Did you see her?
No, I don't think so.
Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in public relations?
Right.
It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem.
Okay.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent.
If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day?
I ride the train.
You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.
Okay, okay.
I got on the train, and then I got off the train.
I don't know.
It's very unclear.
You don't remember anything, do you?
I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley?
Yeah, I agree with you.
Detective Riley?
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different and they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy.
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, but I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kind of sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care, and I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
"Almost exactly a week ago,
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
"No one has seen her since.
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday."
"A wonderful woman,
"an intensely private person with a warm heart.
"She lost a brother when she was 16,
"and both her parents died a few years ago.
"Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information
"to please come forward."
You Megan's friend?
Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Sorry, it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
I don't think so.
And you know Megan from...
Uh, from the gallery.
Oh, you're an artist?
Uh, well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you wanna tell me?
I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.
With who?
She was up there on your porch.
Um...
I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
Yeah.
I know how it feels.
Huh.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Okay, sure.
It could...
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing.
Could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
Right.
Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.
Um, I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...
We took...
We took...
We took Pilates together.
I think I should go.
I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
Hey.
Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him?
I don't know.
There's a guy.
A therapist.
His name's, um, Abdic...
Um, Kama Abdic.
ls that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan?
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't.
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a...
Dr. Kama!
Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.
For the first time in ages, I have purpose.
Or at least I have a distraction.
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
Yeah!
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Abdic's been released.
What?
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him.
It'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
The police think I did it.
Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable.
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.
Got drunk.
No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.
No letters, no e-mails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself.
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
Oh!
Rachel, no.
Ann, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night.
No.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!
And then she...
She got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
No.
That is not what happened.
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.
I don't wanna argue on the street.
It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.
How?
To try and find Megan.
You don't even know Megan!
Rach,
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories?
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.
Pardon?
No.
Sorry.
I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
I'm American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless you are.
No.
Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you wanna tell me about them?
Mmm...
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it, but, um...
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
You wanna talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely... t just broke my heart and...
So I got really sad.
And then, um...
And then the booze just broke us.
Good.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then she betrayed him.
And it sparked something in me.
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th.
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.
She calls again, 1:38.
And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.
And July 6th.
You get the point.
She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know of.
Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree.
But these are texts, they're not threats.
She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
Yeah.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you could bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence.
You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hi.
Reporters are in my yard.
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family.
But she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone.
Just once.
Just say it out loud.
I wanna tell you.
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was 17.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
We called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest.
Her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't wanna see it.
I didn't wanna see her like that.
I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her.
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day, when I was drunk,
I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane.
But I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel.
Give her to me.
Shh.
Mommy's here.
Shh.
Shh.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
"Partially decomposed body found.
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body found.
"Megan Hipwell.
Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed.
"Investigation now being called a homicide.
"Sources say the partially decomposed body found
"is missing Ardsley woman, Megan Hipwell.
"Death a result of blunt force trauma.
"Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide."
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
I saw her again today.
Where?
This afternoon, when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan.
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna.
Anna.
Sweetheart.
Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
And turns out, I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about.
Oh, come on.
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife.
The detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words, too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help you.
You're Tom's crazy ex.
When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
You?
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know, the sessions.
With the doctor.
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
Please!
God.
I need to file a statement.
Name?
Rachel Watson.
Pete, I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
No, you need the context.
I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
You were neighbors at one point.
I met him after.
After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself.
And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No, he didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes-I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you...
I saw you that night tunneling I saw you there and...
All right.
I know I saw you there.
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
All right.
You, uh...
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God.
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the...
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house,
I'd find her sitting there and...
Smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
That is so true!
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha.
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years.
Yeah, I wanted to call you.
Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
Oh.
Um...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out.
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay.
I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive, I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
Um...
I don't...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you wanna lie down?
Come with me.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Rachel, are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
No.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Okay.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene.
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!
Sorry.
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
He's such a bad guy.
Ugh, God.
Are you okay?
Hmm.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hi, it's Megan.
Leave a message.
You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Oh.
Anna?
No.
Go away!
Anna, please.
Please.
There's...
Okay.
Go!
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you.
I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna, he killed Megan.
No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
We don't know anything.
Anna, you need to leave.
You need to leave.
No.
No.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
No.
Get out of here.
It's not safe.
I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair and you know that deep down.
Anna, please, just come with me.
I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, don't.
TOM:
Come in the house, honey.
Please.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!
I know it!
Un-fucking-believable!
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
No!
Yes, she did!
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
Yeah.
You were so tired all the time and...
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
It's all right.
It was all about you, wasn't it?
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
She's fine.
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.
Please just give her to me.
Shh.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Change her here.
Okay.
I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
Shh.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No.
Stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did...
Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Shh.
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
Gonna get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
So what is it?
I just wanna go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
ls that what you want?
No.
Oh.
Like this?
What?
I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man.
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
...you'll love them.
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you'd just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone...
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
No!
And you did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We're tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead.
Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.

The Girl on the Train
Subtitle by Bambula
My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination.
I can't help it.
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you've never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house:
Number 15 Beckett Road...
I don't know when exactly.
I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago and, gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me...
I'm not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She's what I lost.
She's everything I want to be...
I imagine she's a painter...
She's creative.
He's a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can't cook.
I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is "Jess, " tomorrow it could be "Lisa" or "Amber."
It all depends on the day, it depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don't know her name.
I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love...
Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person...
I used to live two doors down... number 13 Beckett Road.
It was my first home.
We bought it together.
It was ours.
Every day, I tell myself not to look.
But then I look...
Are you alone?
-Yeah.
No, come.
It's all yours.
Your baby's so cute.
-Thank you.
-Hi, baby.
Is it...
Is it a boy?
-Yeah.
So sweet.
How... how old is he?
-Six months.
-Six months.
So sweet.
A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention...
I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time.
But since moving here I've come to understand it... 6 MONTHS AGO
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.
It's a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I've been:
rebellious teenager, lover, waitress... gallery director,
nanny, and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can't just be a wife anymore.
That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about seventeen.
With Mac.
Mac?
Who's Mac?
My brother's best friend.
My brother who died...
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.
Sometimes, I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless, make me wanna get pregnant...
And that's not the case?
When I finish work, every night I run home, and I get in the shower and wash the smell of that baby off me as fast as I can.
ANNA
TODAY
When you woke up this morning I went and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
"Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday dear Anna, Happy Birthday to you!"
Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?
Yes he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Oh, hello.
I swear I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You're not sleeping!
Hello?
-You're not sleeping...
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
And grab the corners.
And straighten.
-I got another job.
You what?
I'm really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here...
I am.
It's just this isn't what I "do."
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery head-hunted me.
That's great.
-The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this, without childcare, but, you don't have a job.
Ok, that sounded wrong.
I know that you're busy volunteering.
-It's not the volunteering.
It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmer's market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes.
And I do all of this at the same time as I'm nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work, it's actually better for the kid.
-How would you know?
Your key.
There is no job more important than raising a child...
Megan, please...
Rachel?
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?
!
Hello?
Thank you.
Beautiful.
How many times has she texted you today?
I don't know.
-She called the landline three times.
You have to talk to her.
-I know.
It's getting crazy.
-I will.
I know I know I know.
-Okay.
It's going to be fine.
Isn't it always fine?
Don't I always make everything fine?
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.
You sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
-Call Megan.
Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
-She just told me she got another job.
Shame.
I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
So did I.
RACHEL
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.
Hey, Tom, it's me.
I just wanted to wish Momma happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Momma.
-Rachel!
Jesus...
No no no.
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it!
-Relax.
-Cathy, come on!
-Relax.
I just need something to go to sleep.
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
-Yeah?
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends.
I got it.
I got it.
-Alright.
I'll just get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling them.
Okay?
I really appreciate this room.
I do.
I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or a month.
Yeah.
That was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It's okay, sweetie.
We're gonna try again.
We can't afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she's looking at...
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She's throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs.
Holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you.
I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found dozens of emails.
Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together.
I know what they say: "You shouldn't check his email."
I was stupid.
But when I saw it was from the realtor
I thought that it was just spam.
And then I realized that they were kisses not Xs and my husband was fucking a Century 21 Agent.
That sucks.
-It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd", but just yell it.
-Right.
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking picked everything in that house!
I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail, but this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else...
I...
Betraying her husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
Like something has been taken from me again.
If I could...
If I could, I'd just go to her house.
And I'd go in and find her sitting at the kitchen table.
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and jerk her head back.
Just jerk it back!
And then I'd pull her down to the ground and I would just smash her head all over the floor!
Move!
Get out of my way!
Move!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I've spent the past hour driving around looking for you!
You scared the shit out of Anna, do you know that?
She thought you were going to...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone!
You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours.
I'm not gonna protect you any more.
Oh my god...
Rachel, open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
-Are you ok?
Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu, okay?
-You don't have a flu.
What the fuck, Rachel?
I'm not stupid...
Rachel!
-Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
Anyone counting days one to ninety who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I'm Jason, I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
-I've got twenty-two days back.
Anyone else?
Hi, I'm Rachel, and...
-Welcome, Rachel.
This is day one, I suppose.
I'm here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up covered in blood.
And I had bruises all over my arm and...
It's usually from when I've fallen and someone has helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what I'd done the night before.
And I learned that when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you're sorry for what you did and you're sorry for who you are and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do.
You do it again.
And there's... time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
It was that homeless thing.
I don't remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter...
-Yeah.
-That was a tube top, right?
-Yeah, it was.
Do you like Devil's Eggs, Martha?
-Deviled Eggs?
Yeah, I do.
Deviled Eggs.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody?
-Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?
So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?
Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want.
Or do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn, and a couple on the wall!
Rachel!
-I'm fine, Tom.
Stop it!
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
-That's my boss's wife.
You probably got me fired back there.
-I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.
I'm your wife and you never...
-Rachel!
-You never fucking support me!
Please stop.
Hey, come on.
I need you to focus here.
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
-Relax!
Rachel, there you are.
-Cathy, I'm sorry.
I need to get my shit together.
I'm...
You must be Miss Watson.
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What's this about?
-Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were Friday night?
I was at work in the city.
And then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
-You mean your EX-husband?
Yes.
So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson.
And then...
And then I decided that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On your way back here, did you stop anywhere?
No.
-And what time did you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
-So...
What did you do during those hours in Ardsley if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She's gone missing.
-What do you mean she's missing?
Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...
I was...
-Do you know Megan Hipwell?
-No.
-Did you see her?
No.
I don't think so.
-Is that because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job in Public Relations?
Right.
-It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem?
Ok.
That's enough for now.
If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent...
If you don't have a job, then what do you do everyday?
-I...
I ride the train.
-You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking weird, Rachel!
-Okay.
Okay.
I got on the train.
And then, I got off the train.
I don't know!
It's very unclear...
You don't remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar and drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did until the police came to get him.
Rachel!
-What?
What?
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks.
-Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley!
-Yeah, I agree with you, but...
-Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you didn't know her.
No.
But I saw her.
-You saw her where?
I saw her from the train.
She was standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
-No.
It wasn't him.
This man was different.
And they were kissing.
Wow.
That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize, is cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy, but...
-Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited.
And that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.
Don't contact your ex-husband.
Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.
Are you listening to me?
-Yes.
You don't live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
4 MONTHS AGO
I lie to Scott.
I lie to you.
I mean I know that's not the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men, the Exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It's like having a secret.
It's like touching yourself and no one else knows...
Except you.
But you're just pretending.
You're just pretending to touch yourself.
Scott's possessive.
Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kinda sexy.
So, when I came home last night, Scott was on my laptop wondering why...
Scott's behavior is not normal.
It's a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It's not abuse.
Not if you don't care.
And I don't.
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Is it normal I think about you all the time?
Almost exactly a week ago, Megan Hipwell walked out of Number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared.
No one has seen her since.
Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday.
Ardsley Woman Still Missing
A wonderful woman.
An intensely private person with a warm heart.
She lost a brother when she was sixteen, and both her parents died a few years ago.
Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information to please come forward.
You're Megan's friend?
-Yes.
Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
-Sure.
Thank you.
Sorry it's a mess.
I've been hunting for her social, birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
-I don't think so.
And you know Megan from?
-From the gallery.
Are you an artist?
-Well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone, you wanted to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife with someone, on Friday morning.
-With who?
She was up there on your porch.
I saw her from the train because I commute to Manhattan everyday and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible thing to hear.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
No, no, no.
Thank you.
OK.
Sure.
It could, I don't know.
Maybe it's a good thing?
It could mean she's all right.
She just ran off with someone.
-Right.
She talked to you?
-Oh no.
I haven't heard anything.
You know her well enough to know where we live.
Megan doesn't have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby...
She and I, we took yoga...
We took pilates together.
I think I should go, I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way.
Do you think you'd recognize him again?
If you saw him?
I don't know.
There was a guy, a therapist.
His name's Abdic.
Abdic.
Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don't know.
I really can't tell.
She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink.
I remember...
That's him.
I remember.
That's him.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid.
He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
-Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn't...
No.
Megan.
Don't make it impossible for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice!
I don't give a fuck...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist...
For the first time in ages I have purpose.
Or at least, I have a distraction...
I want Megan to show up safe and sound.
I do.
SCOTT:
We need to meet ASAP
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What's wrong?
-Abdic's been released.
What?
!
There wasn't enough evidence.
And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.
A lot.
They'll build a case against him, it'll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with?
-Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don't understand.
-The police think I did it.
-Yeah, but he's the one...
He told them Megan's miserable, that I'm a jealous, controlling husband.
I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out...
Abdic told them I'm abusive.
When she walked out, I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for fuck's sake, and got drunk.
-No.
We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.
I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.
There's no emails, there's nothing, no letters, no emails.
Nothing.
For a second, I thought about contacting Abdic myself...
Fucking phone won't stop!
This is Scott.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Do you mind?
You're heavy.
You're a fatty.
You're a little fatty.
Rachel?
No.
Anna, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night!
What are you talking about?
-Yes.
Yes, she did.
Yes, you did.
And then she got in your car.
No.
She said you yelled at her that night.
-No.
That is not what happened!
She was in the tunnel.
And she hit me.
I won't argue in the street.
The middle of the day and you're drunk.
I'm not drunk, Tom!
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.
Let's start with child abduction.
That's bullshit.
You know that's not... how it happened.
You and I both know what you're capable of.
You were just at Scott Hipwell's house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?
!
-Because I'm helping him.
-How?
To try and find Megan.
-You don't even know Megan!
Rach.
I don't think you're helping anybody.
So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories.
Is that correct?
-You have an accent.
Pardon?
-Sorry.
I wasn't expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
-I'm an American citizen.
But I guess you're not here to talk about me.
Unless, you are...
-No.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make conversation.
The blackouts.
You're experiencing blackouts.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,
it just doesn't feel like me or like something that I would do.
I feel bad about it.
But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...
I just don't feel bad enough.
You want to take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
-So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You've been drinking today, haven't you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw.
Art, I guess.
Good.
We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them.
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.
Have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom.
When I couldn't get pregnant.
Who's Tom?
He's my ex-husband.
Do you want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart.
So I got really sad and then...
The booze just broke us.
Okay.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the embodiment of true love.
It's like the kind of love you always want.
And then, she betrayed him.
And it's sparked something in me...
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I'm afraid of myself.
July 5th: 1:33, 1:34, 1:37...
She calls again 1:38 and then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 PM.
And then July 6th...
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown number.
-Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other.
Look, has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?
Not that I know.
-Well, then you might have a case for harassment in the second degree, but these are texts, they're not threats, so...
She's been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.
A lot.
I'm aware.
There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.
If you can bring me something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence.
Real evidence?
You sure your husband doesn't want to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What?
No.
She's harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

Hi.
Hi.
-Reporters are in my yard.
Everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something I've wanted to hear for a long time.
She's pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family, but she fought me every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.
1 MONTH AGO
You shouldn't be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone, just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I'll be gone, I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was seventeen.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
I called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We'd gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He'd gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
I was freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest,
her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn't look.
I didn't want to see it.
I didn't want to see her.
I wrapped her in a blanket.
And I buried her.
Then...
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day when I was drunk, I decided to go there.
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who's Evie?
Tom's baby.
I know this sounds insane, but I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel?
What are you doing?
!
What are you doing?
Rachel...
I wasn't going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
Partially decomposed body found...
Female body found...
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body.
Megan Hipwell.
Investigation now being called a homicide.
Sources say the partially decomposed body found is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide.
Mr. Hipwell?
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
-Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?
!
I saw her again today.
-Where?
This afternoon when the police brought Scott back home.
She was across the street.
And when she saw me she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan
Then why is she creeping around Scott's house?
She's dangerous and you know it.
Anna, sweetheart, Rachel is a sad person.
She's completely harmless.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I'm not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came to see me last night.
It turns out I'm not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don't know what this is about...
-Come on!
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
-Admit what?
Admit that you never even fucking met my wife!
The Detective said you didn't even know Megan.
She used other words too.
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable?
I am sorry.
I was honestly just trying to help.
You're Tom's crazy ex!
When the fuck were you going to tell me that?
And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?
!
You?
!
I would never even get near someone like you!
My wife is dead, and you're lying to me!
?
What's wrong with you?
Who does this?
-I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex!
Well, thank you, you know.
For getting Abdic to point the finger at me!
For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know?
The sessions?
With the doctor?
I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you.
You're just a sad liar with no life.
You're all liars.
-Please, dont!
I need to file a statement.
-Name?
-Rachel Watson.
-Pete?
I got this.
You wanted to file a statement?
I'm listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new boyfriend Scott Hipwell?
No.
We were just friends.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I mean, you got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
You need the context.
-I know the context.
But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered?
I mean, you were neighbors at one point?
I met him after...
-After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself, and then you manage to get him to incriminate himself all the while hoping he'll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that you say you can't account for.
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.
No.
He didn't.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.
You're lying.
You're lying.
Tell me what happened.
It's okay.
Tell me.
I don't know...
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
LAST FRIDAY
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don't have to be afraid of being alone.
You're not alone.
You'll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there.
I know I saw you there!
-Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened that night?
What did you see?
You busted your ass.
You fell.
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off.
So, I fucked off.
-Was I with anyone?
Was I alone?
What happened?
!
-I don't know.
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.
That's all I can tell you.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
-I need you to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I'm assuming it's the worst.
God...
Come here for one second.
Just one second.
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom.
When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband.
I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I'd go to her house, find her sitting... and I'd smash her head all over the floor!
Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me.
I'm sorry to leave this way.
I'll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
It's so true.
It's the worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha?
Rachel?
I haven't seen you in a million years...
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but Tom said I should just leave it alone.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
I just need you to know that I don't remember anything and I just completely blacked out...
Everyone had a little too much to drink, so...
It's okay.
-I know, but with the eggs...
And then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive.
I just feel...
I just feel so ashamed about it.
I don't...
Tom...
Tom said that I smashed your plate.
I don't...
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom.
Do you want to lie down?
Come with me.
Excuse us...
Rachel?
Are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you want.
-No, no.
That's fine.
Thanks.
I think I'd remember if you caused a scene...
I'm so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I'm sorry, Tom...
-Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry.
-I'm sorry.
-What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.
You can't even fucking stand up.
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No...
No...
Yeah.
Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
Such a bad guy.
God.
Are you okay?
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3.
I'm here, where are you?
I can't.
Stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you heard something.
-I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel's down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
You're okay.
You just need some help.
-Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
-Anna.
No, no.
-Anna, please.
-Go away.
Go.
-I'm just going to stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.
-I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Where's Tom?
He's lying to you.
He always does.
He's a good liar.
-I know he's a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He's just done it to you...
-I know he's cheating.
I know.
Anna...
He killed Megan.
-No, we don't...
We don't know that.
He's dangerous.
-We don't know anything!
Anna, you need to leave.
-No.
-You need to leave.
You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
-No.
-Get out of here.
-I'm not leaving him.
It's hardly the first time he's had an affair.
It's not about the affair.
And you know that, deep down.
Anna, please just come with me.
-I'm not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, dont.
Dont!
Please.
-Come in the house, honey.
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker, I saw you!
You murderer!
You fucking murderer!
You killed her!
You fucking killed her, I know it!
You're un-fucking-believable.
Now listen.
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out.
I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car?
Did Megan get in your car?
-No!
-Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth.
Just tell her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel, because I saw her with you.
I found Megan's phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls.
They weren't from Rachel.
So were you fucking her while she was here, working?
While she was looking after our daughter?
!
You were so tired all the time.
It's all about Evie.
That's right.
Tom, give her to me.
-It's all right.
Tom, give her to me.
Please.
Please give her to me.
I think she needs changing.
Please?
-It's gonna be fine.
-Please just give her to me.
Let her go.
You're going to hurt her.
-Change her here.
Okay, I'll change her.
Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.
911, what's your...
What's your emergency?
No no, stay.
Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things.
I didn't do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But, I didn't.
You know, I saw Martha on the train.
-Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train.
And she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office!
Rachel's down there.
Wait here.
You want to get in the car?
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I'm here.
What is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is this what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
-I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There's a chance it could be yours.
-Then get an abortion.
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want.
But if it's not then...
Get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You're a shitty nanny.
What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be fun to have you both around.
I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates.
-I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.
-I took care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna because you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore!
And you fucked me because you couldn't fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man!
You're not gonna get rid of me.
You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.
You're like a dog.
Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
You can kick them, but they keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're not doing this again.
You'll love them.
-This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn't.
You did.
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice.
He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we share.
Today, I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible.
Because I am not the girl I used to be.
Lothbrok:
Previously on vikings...
-What is your name?
-Yidu.
(screaming)
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend paris to the death.
(arrows whooshing)
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, father, nor does any man.
My name is harald, but my people call me king finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself king of all norway!
In order to become king of all norway,
You would have to overthrow my husband.
( if I had a heart playing)
-(arrow whooshing) -(vase shattering)
(crowd cheering)
That was impressive.
I modified the frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.
(in native tongue)
(chanting)
(chanting continues)
All:
Ahhh!
(weapons clinking)
Bjorn must have murdered our berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
-Through torvi?
-Of course, through torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
(grunts)
-(weapons clinking) -(grunts)
Lagertha must never know what we did.
(struggling)
Who would tell her?
Hmm?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven torvi for leaving him.
-Really?
-Hmm.
Lagertha:
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
(chuckles)
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known
That we were fated to be together.
(ominous music playing)
Lagertha?
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
-(ominous music playing) -(birds chirping)
Who is he?
(sighs) you heard.
He's a king.
From tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
(thudding)
Why do you not care for your daughter siggy?
(boat creaking)
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man
Takes a mother away from her child?
(rope thudding)
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
Viking 5:
I need a bit more slack on the sail.
(whispers) I have definitely failed at being a husband.
-(chuckles) -viking 4:
Need a hand?
Viking 5:
Take more than that.
Viking 4:
No, three will do.
-Harald:
I want that close to me.
-(paddles thudding)
Viking 3:
Why would we?
Viking 5:
Oil these oars!
How many boats and men do you have?
Woman:
More?
No, take more.
Take one more.
I will go get one.
Do you have enough?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told ragnar mine is a small kingdom
For now.
Viking 1:
Better for the night.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother halfdan is bringing them.
Viking 3:
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
(laughing)
(laughing) he's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, bjorn lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame
Won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
Woman 1:
And this one is rotten at the bottom.
Look!
Woman 2:
Take it out.
We'll take it back.
Woman 1:
It won't last a week in the rain.
Viking 1:
These ones are dry there.
Viking 3:
Here.
And more.
Woman:
Ah, thank you.
I'll mend these.
Viking 2:
And then pass it down.
Sentry:
Rider!
(sheep bleating)
(ominous music playing)
Woman:
How many are there?
-(people chattering) -(swords clinking)
Open the gates!
Werferth.
We are met to decide how to deal with mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now
Is a full-scale invasion
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring queen kwenthrith to her throne,
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as "w"?
Let me help you please, sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom
Are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
"w" stands for wigstan.
As well as being one of the most powerful warlords in mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the ruling council.
No.
Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
(chukles) my lord,
No one should ever trust wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not!
The only way forward,
The only choice now,
Is for both of you noble kings
To raise your armies
And invade mercia
And rid my kingdom
Of all the factions who want to ruin me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.
(sighs) I agree with the queen.
There is no other choice now.
Ecbert:
Huh.
So it seems.
Very well.
We shall take your advice.
(whip snapping)
(muttering)
(breathing heavily)
Wife,
Come to bed.
I said...
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
(exhales deeply) very well.
(voice cracking) then go sleep with my father,
Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
-(groans) -go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
(exhales deeply)
You are husband to me
In name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.
(sighs)
(sniffs)
(aethelwulf exhales)
(exhaling deeply)
-(exhales) -(soft music playing)
(door closing)
(door creaks open)
(door closes)
We had an argument.
Aethelwulf?
He called me your whore,
Which I am
And have freely chosen to be.
Do you want me to leave?
(howling in distance)
(papers rustling)
(drawer opening)
This was my wife's ring.
My wife died in childbirth.
I cannot tell you the pain of it.
And I was resolved
Never to marry again.
But I would like you
To wear it
If you will.
-(bell ringing) -(drum music playing)
Odo:
The forts have been built according to your instructions, your grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain
Which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
Odo:
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
Rollo:
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
Odo:
What has become clear to both the emperor and myself
Is that, if we were to lose paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the marne, the seine, and the yonne rivers,
And the country would lie open as far as reims.
Rollo:
We must hold paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns,
Everything will be decided here.
(pouring)
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
Rollo:
I know.
A man can dream, can he not,
Of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
(sighs) he has count odo.
I don't like count odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course,
It's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward
(inhales)
Kills a man
By stabbing him in the back.
That is what a viking would say!
But you are no longer a viking.
In frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.
(chuckles) something you'll certainly have to learn.
(bells ringing in distance)
(bells continue)
(men talking softly)
(doors closing)
Charles:
You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your highness, forgive me,
I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
Charles:
You mean count odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt
And just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled
That you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
(birds shrieking in distance)
An emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
(shouting) do...
Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your highness knows,
A man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress,
And only afterwards,
(chuckles) if at all,
To his wife.
Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.
(ominous music playing)
Charles:
For god's sake!
How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.
Charles:
Is it true?
Yes, your highness.
Does count odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition
(stuttering) to replace me?
To become
Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become emperor.
Then...
Then I beg you,
(stuttering) please,
Stay close,
To count odo.
Report to me anything which might signal his treachery.
Now, go!
Leave me!
(sobbing in distance)
(chuckles)
(birds chirping)
(bird chittering)
(sighs)
(chittering continues)
Is this how you looked?
Yes.
Though my hair was much shorter.
What is the name of your kingdom?
China.
And who rules it?
The emperor dezong,
Of the tang dynasty.
I want to know about your father.
My father was a...
A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the emperor?
Tell me about him.
The emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
...With his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after
By the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.
(yidu snickers)
(chuckles)
(music playing)
(whispers) are you one of the emperor's daughters?
(exhales)
-My father was a merchant.
-I know.
You told me that before.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.
-Do you want to hear it?
-Yes.
Mmm-hmm?
I can share your burden.
Mmm.
I am small,
But I have broad shoulders
And I am not afraid.
I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.
-(grunts) -(gasps)
All right.
Then give me more of that medicine.
(bird chittering)
(chopping)
-(doors creaking) -so we are agreed,
We'll raise an army and attack mercia.
Not if we wish to see queen kwenthrith placed once more upon the throne.
(horses neighing)
Travel safely, my lord.
You are the best of allies.
-But full of conviction.
-Ecbert:
Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.
Remember your duties,
Say your prayers,
And banish the devil from your thoughts.
Such good advice, my lord aelle.
Farewell.
Kwenthrith:
King ecbert?
-Yes, queen kwenthrith?
-Man:
All men forward!
Man:
Move out!
I need to know that I can trust you.
That you will do what you promised me.
Why would you doubt me?
You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.
(ominous music playing)
(door creak open)
Lord,
You know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness,
Like a fallen angel,
To suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, lord,
That I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night,
Of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?
(wind howling)
And yet,
I would sup with the devil
If he would show me
How to achieve my earthly goals.
Your kingdom, lord, as you have said, is not of this world,
But my kingdom is.
(fire crackling)
(exhales deeply)
-(horn blowing) -(chattering)
Bjorn ironside,
Come and sit with me.
We should talk to one another.
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to trust you.
You have told me of your ambitions.
(sniffs)
I will never give you any cause to kill me.
(scoffs)
That is not for you to say.
I may find cause where others may not.
Who knows?
(drum music starts playing)
But for now anyway,
We are allies.
And we shall go together to paris.
And we shall fight together.
Is it not so?
You and ragnar need my warriors.
You need my ships.
I can't wait for paris,
Bjorn ironside.
I cannot wait.
We shall destroy those christian folk!
They have seen nothing yet.
We are the masters now!
-Is it not so?
-All men:
Yes!
Yeah!
-Is it not so?
-All men:
Yes!
(epic music playing)
(horns blowing)
Man 1:
A boat's come in!
Man 2:
They're here!
Man 3:
Bring him in!
Man 4:
Over here!
(talking indistinctly)
(cheering)
(both grunting)
-Brother.
-Brother!
This is kattegat!
This is kattegat.
Come.
(knife thuds)
(knife thuds)
King ragnar,
This is my brother halfdan.
Meet the notorious king ragnar.
(breathing heavily)
Halfdan:
It's a great honor.
When do we sail for paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the christians, yes.
I hate the christians.
In the name of odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them
Once we reach paris.
(ominous music playing)
(knives thudding)
-(cheering and laughing) -woman:
Faster!
-Argh!
-(laughing)
(drums playing)
(bucket splashing)
(shouting and laughing)
(shouting and laughing continue)
They'll be wondering where you are.
I doubt it.
(sighs)
What are you thinking about?
Paris.
You must be excited to be going back.
(softly) no.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win,
But now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement
In a distant country where I took many of my people and friends
To make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
(inhales deeply)
(sighs)
And nobody knows.
My father's the emperor.
(laughs)
-(shouting and laughing) -(music continues)
They say he left kattegat a boy and came back a man.
Killed a bear with his bare hands.
With his own hands?
Hmm.
(music stops)
(ominous music playing)
Who is that?
It is floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me,
He has fallen out with king ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
-Fill the horns.
-Sup.
This is my younger brother, halfdan.
-He's keen to know you.
-All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world,
And helped made ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet christian.
-Floki!
-(chuckles)
Skol.
To new friendships.
Skol!
Skol!
(softly) skol.

Mine!

Ivar, do you want to play?
Child:
Got it!
Child:
It's mine, give it back!
Now you go!
Child:
Here!
To me!
Throw it!
Here!
Give it here!
-Not to him.
-Child:
No, you...
Higher!
My turn!
To me!
Come on!
Here!
(straining)
(grunting)
(groans)
(children screaming)
(screaming)
Do not be afraid.
It's not your fault.
(whispers) everything is all right.
Everything will be all right.
(ominous music playing)
(women chattering)
(music playing)
(women laughing)
What is that?
Can I see?
Where did you find this?
I took it from someone.
Why are you so interested?
I want to talk to you.
What about?
Us.
We have moments when I feel so close to you,
Especially when you're inside me, but then you don't want to talk,
And I wonder why you really came for me
And took me away from my child.
(chuckles)
Torvi.
I talk to you.
By the way,
That was erlendur's ring.
(suspenseful music playing)
He got it from his father, king horik.
You look...
Lagertha, you look so beautiful.
This is always how I imagined this moment.
Wherever I am,
I don't ever want to forget how you looked on our wedding day.
(gasps)
(somber music playing)
(groans)
(chuckles)
(indistinct talking)
(ominous music playing)
Earl kalf is dead.

LOTHBROK:
Previously on Vikings...
- What is your name?
- Yidu.
(SCREAMING)
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend Paris to the death.
(ARROWS WHOOSHING)
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a Viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, Father, nor does any man.
My name is Harald, but my people call me King Finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself King of all Norway!
In order to become King of all Norway, you would have to overthrow my husband.
(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)
- (ARROW WHOOSHING) - (VASE SHATTERING)
(CROWD CHEERING)
That was impressive.
I modified the Frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The Franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.

(CHANTING)

(CHANTING CONTINUES)
_
ALL:
Ahhh!
(WEAPONS CLINKING)
Bjorn must have murdered our Berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in Ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
- Through Torvi?
- Of course, through Torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
(GRUNTS)
- (WEAPONS CLINKING) - (GRUNTS)
WOMAN: (IN DISTANCE) Ahhh!
Lagertha must never know what we did.
(STRUGGLING)
Who would tell her?
Hmm?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven Torvi for leaving him.
- Really?
- Hmm.
LAGERTHA:
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
(CHUCKLES)
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, Lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known that we were fated to be together.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Lagertha?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
- (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) - (BIRDS CHIRPING)
Who is he?
(SIGHS) You heard.
He's a king.
From Tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
(THUDDING)
Why do you not care for your daughter Siggy?
(BOAT CREAKING)
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man takes a mother away from her child?
(ROPE THUDDING)
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
No.
VIKING 5:
I need a bit more slack on the sail.
(WHISPERS) I have definitely failed at being a husband.
- (CHUCKLES)
- VIKING 4:
Need a hand?
VIKING 5:
Take more than that.
VIKING 4:
No, three will do.
- VIKING 5:
Bring it here.
- Where do you think?
-HARALD:
I want that close to me.
-(PADDLES THUDDING)
VIKING 3:
Why would we?
VIKING 5:
Oil these oars!
How many boats and men do you have?
WOMAN:
More?
No, take more.
Take one more.
I will go get one.
Do you have enough?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told Ragnar mine is a small kingdom for now.
VIKING 1:
Better for the night.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother Halfdan is bringing them.
VIKING 3:
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
(LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING) He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame won't make your small kingdom any bigger.

The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
...with his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.
(YIDU SNICKERS)
(CHUCKLES)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(WHISPERS) Are you one of the Emperor's daughters?
(EXHALES)
- My father was a merchant.
- I know.
You told me that before.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.
Mmm-hmm?
I can share your burden.
Mmm.
I am small, but I have broad shoulders and I am not afraid.
I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.
- (GRUNTS) - (GASPS)
All right.
Then give me more of that medicine.
(BIRD CHITTERING)
(CHOPPING)
So we are agreed, we'll raise an army and attack Mercia.
There is no alternative, my Lord Aelle.
Not if we wish to see Queen Kwenthrith placed once more upon the throne.
(HORSES NEIGHING)
Travel safely, my Lord.
You are the best of allies.
AELLE:
I'm a simple man at heart, but full of conviction.
ECBERT:
Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, Father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.
Remember your duties, say your prayers, and banish the Devil from your thoughts.
Such good advice, my Lord Aelle.
Farewell.
KWENTHRITH:
King Ecbert?
MAN:
Front King's Guard!
- Yes, Queen Kwenthrith?
- MAN:
All men forward!
MAN:
Move out!
I need to know that I can trust you.
That you will do what you promised me.
Why would you doubt me?
You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
(DOOR CREAK OPEN)
Lord,
you know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness, like a fallen angel, to suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, Lord, that I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night, of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?
(WIND HOWLING)
And yet,
I would sup with the Devil if he would show me how to achieve my earthly goals.
Your kingdom, Lord, as you have said, is not of this world, but my kingdom is.
(FIRE CRACKLING)
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
- (HORN BLOWING) - (CHATTERING)
Bjorn Ironside, come and sit with me.
We should talk to one another.
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to trust you.
You have told me of your ambitions.
(SNIFFS)
I will never give you any cause to kill me.
(SCOFFS)
That is not for you to say.
I may find cause where others may not.
Who knows?
(DRUM MUSIC STARTS PLAYING)
But for now anyway, we are allies.
And we shall go together to Paris.
And we shall fight together.
Is it not so?
You and Ragnar need my warriors.
You need my ships.
I can't wait for Paris,
Bjorn Ironside.
I cannot wait.
We shall destroy those Christian folk!
They have seen nothing yet.
We are the masters now!
- Is it not so?
- ALL MEN:
Yes!
Yeah!
- Is it not so?
- ALL MEN:
Yes!

It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.

Paris.
You must be excited to be going back.
(SOFTLY) No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(SIGHS)
And nobody knows.
My father's the Emperor.
(LAUGHS)
- (SHOUTING AND LAUGHING) - (MUSIC CONTINUES)
They say he left Kattegat a boy and came back a man.
Killed a bear with his bare hands.
With his own hands?
Hmm.
(MUSIC STOPS)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Who is that?
It is Floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me, he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, Floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.
- All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet Christian.
- Floki!

Torvi.
I talk to you.
By the way, that was Erlendur's ring.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
He got it from his father, King Horik.

Previously on Vikings...
- What is your name?
- Yidu.
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend Paris to the death.
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a Viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, Father, nor does any man.
My name is Harald, but my people call me King Finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself King of all Norway!
In order to become King of all Norway, you would have to overthrow my husband.
That was impressive.
I modified the Frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The Franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.
Ahhh!
Bjorn must have murdered our Berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in Ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
- Through Torvi?
- Of course, through Torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
Ahhh!
Lagertha must never know what we did.
Who would tell her?
Hmm?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven Torvi for leaving him.
- Really?
- Hmm.
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, Lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known that we were fated to be together.
Lagertha?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
Who is he?
You heard.
He's a king.
From Tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
Why do you not care for your daughter Siggy?
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man takes a mother away from her child?
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
No.
I need a bit more slack on the sail.
I have definitely failed at being a husband.
Need a hand?
Take more than that.
No, three will do.
- Bring it here.
- Where do you think?
I want that close to me.
Why would we?
Oil these oars!
How many boats and men do you have?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told Ragnar mine is a small kingdom for now.
Better for the night.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother Halfdan is bringing them.
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
And this one is rotten at the bottom.
Look!
Take it out.
We'll take it back.
It won't last a week in the rain.
These ones are dry there.
Here.
And more.
Ah, thank you.
I'll mend these.
And then pass it down.
Rider!
How many are there?
Open the gates!
Werferth.
We are met to decide how to deal with Mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now is a full-scale invasion of their kingdom.
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring Queen Kwenthrith to her throne,
I think we must explore it.
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as "W"?
Let me help you please, Sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
"W" stands for Wigstan.
He has royal blood, as well as being one of the most powerful warlords in Mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the Ruling Council.
No.
Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
My Lord, no one should ever trust Wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not!
The only way forward, the only choice now, is for both of you noble kings to raise your armies and invade Mercia and rid my kingdom of all the factions who want to ruin me!
Me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.
I agree with the Queen.
There is no other choice now.
Huh.
So it seems.
Very well.
We shall take your advice.
Wife, come to bed.
I said...
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
Very well.
Then go sleep with my father, you whore!
Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the Queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
Go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
You are husband to me in name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.
We had an argument.
Aethelwulf?
He called me your whore, which I am and have freely chosen to be.
Do you want me to leave?
This was my wife's ring.
My wife died in childbirth.
I cannot tell you the pain of it.
And I was resolved never to marry again.
But I would like you to wear it
if you will.
The forts have been built according to your instructions, Your Grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
What has become clear to both the Emperor and myself is that, if we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the Marne, the Seine, and the Yonne rivers, and the country would lie open as far as Reims.
We must hold Paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns, everything will be decided here.
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands and set up my own court.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
I know.
A man can dream, can he not, of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
He has Count Odo.
I don't like Count Odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course, it's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the Emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward kills a man by stabbing him in the back.
That is what a Viking would say!
But you are no longer a Viking.
In Frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.
Something you'll certainly have to learn.
You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your Highness, forgive me,
I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
You mean Count Odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt and just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled that you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
An Emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
Do...
Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards, if at all, to his wife.
Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.
For God's sake!
How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.
Is it true?
Yes, Your Highness.
And?
Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition to replace me?
To become
Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become Emperor.
Then...
Then I beg you, please, stay close, to Count Odo.
Report to me anything which might signal his treachery.
Now, go!
Leave me!
Is this how you looked?
Yes.
Though my hair was much shorter.
What is the name of your kingdom?
China.
And who rules it?
The Emperor Dezong, of the Tang Dynasty.
I want to know about your father.
My father was a...
A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the Emperor?
Tell me about him.
The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
With his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.

This is Kattegat.
Come.
King Ragnar, this is my brother Halfdan.
Meet the notorious King Ragnar.
It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.

My brother Halfdan is bringing them.
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
And this one is rotten at the bottom.
Look!
Take it out.
We'll take it back.
It won't last a week in the rain.
These ones are dry there.
Here.
And more.
Ah, thank you.
I'll mend these.
And then pass it down.
Rider!
How many are there?
Open the gates!
Werferth.
We are met to decide how to deal with Mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now is a full-scale invasion of their kingdom.
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring Queen Kwenthrith to her throne,
I think we must explore it.
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as "W"?
Let me help you please, Sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
"W" stands for Wigstan.
He has royal blood, as well as being one of the most powerful warlords in Mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the Ruling Council.
No.
Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
My Lord, no one should ever trust Wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not!
The only way forward, the only choice now, is for both of you noble kings to raise your armies and invade Mercia and rid my kingdom of all the factions who want to ruin me!
Me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.
I agree with the Queen.
There is no other choice now.
Huh.
So it seems.
Very well.
We shall take your advice.
Wife, come to bed.
I said...
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
Very well.
Then go sleep with my father, you whore!
Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the Queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
Go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
You are husband to me in name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.
We had an argument.
Aethelwulf?
He called me your whore, which I am and have freely chosen to be.
Do you want me to leave?
This was my wife's ring.
My wife died in childbirth.
I cannot tell you the pain of it.
And I was resolved never to marry again.
But I would like you to wear it
if you will.
The forts have been built according to your instructions, Your Grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
What has become clear to both the Emperor and myself is that, if we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the Marne, the Seine, and the Yonne rivers, and the country would lie open as far as Reims.
We must hold Paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns, everything will be decided here.
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands and set up my own court.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
I know.
A man can dream, can he not, of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
He has Count Odo.
I don't like Count Odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course, it's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the Emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward kills a man by stabbing him in the back.
That is what a Viking would say!
But you are no longer a Viking.
In Frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.
Something you'll certainly have to learn.
You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your Highness, forgive me,
I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
You mean Count Odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt and just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled that you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
An Emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
Do...
Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards, if at all, to his wife.
Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.
For God's sake!
How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.
Is it true?
Yes, Your Highness.
And?
Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition to replace me?
To become
Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become Emperor.
Then...
Then I beg you, please, stay close, to Count Odo.
Report to me anything which might signal his treachery.
Now, go!
Leave me!
Is this how you looked?
Yes.
Though my hair was much shorter.
What is the name of your kingdom?
China.
And who rules it?
The Emperor Dezong, of the Tang Dynasty.
I want to know about your father.
My father was a...
A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the Emperor?
Tell me about him.
The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
...with his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.
Are you one of the Emperor's daughters?
- My father was a merchant.
- I know.
You told me that before.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.
Mmm-hmm?
I can share your burden.
Mmm.
I am small, but I have broad shoulders and I am not afraid.
I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.
All right.
Then give me more of that medicine.
So we are agreed, we'll raise an army and attack Mercia.
There is no alternative, my Lord Aelle.
Not if we wish to see Queen Kwenthrith placed once more upon the throne.
Travel safely, my Lord.
You are the best of allies.
I'm a simple man at heart, but full of conviction.
Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, Father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.
Remember your duties, say your prayers, and banish the Devil from your thoughts.
Such good advice, my Lord Aelle.
Farewell.
King Ecbert?
Front King's Guard!
- Yes, Queen Kwenthrith?
- All men forward!
Move out!
I need to know that I can trust you.
That you will do what you promised me.
Why would you doubt me?
You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.
Lord,
you know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness, like a fallen angel, to suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, Lord, that I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night, of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?
And yet,
I would sup with the Devil if he would show me how to achieve my earthly goals.
Your kingdom, Lord, as you have said, is not of this world, but my kingdom is.
Bjorn Ironside, come and sit with me.
We should talk to one another.
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to trust you.
You have told me of your ambitions.
I will never give you any cause to kill me.
That is not for you to say.
I may find cause where others may not.
Who knows?
But for now anyway, we are allies.
And we shall go together to Paris.
And we shall fight together.
Is it not so?
You and Ragnar need my warriors.
You need my ships.
I can't wait for Paris,
Bjorn Ironside.
I cannot wait.
We shall destroy those Christian folk!
They have seen nothing yet.
We are the masters now!
- Is it not so?
- Yes!
Yeah!
- Is it not so?
- Yes!
- A boat's come in!
- They're here!
- Bring him in!
- Over here!
- Brother.
- Brother!
This is Kattegat!
This is Kattegat.
Come.
King Ragnar, this is my brother Halfdan.
Meet the notorious King Ragnar.
It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.
Faster!
Argh!
They'll be wondering where you are.
I doubt it.
What are you thinking about?
Paris.
You must be excited to be going back.
No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
And nobody knows.
My father's the Emperor.
They say he left Kattegat a boy and came back a man.
Killed a bear with his bare hands.
With his own hands?
Hmm.
Who is that?
It is Floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me, he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, Floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.
- All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet Christian.
Floki!
Skol.
To new friendships.
Skol!
Skol!
Skol.
- My turn!
- Here, catch it!
Mine!
Ivar, do you want to play?
Got it!
It's mine, give it back!
Now you go!
Here!
To me!
Throw it!
Here!
Give it here!
- Not to him.
- No, you...
Higher!
My turn!
To me!
Come on!
Here!
Do not be afraid.
It's not your fault.
Everything is all right.
Everything will be all right.
What is that?
Can I see?
Where did you find this?
I took it from someone.
Why are you so interested?
I want to talk to you.
What about?
Us.
We have moments when I feel so close to you, especially when you're inside me, but then you don't want to talk, and I wonder why you really came for me and took me away from my child.
Torvi.
I talk to you.
By the way, that was Erlendur's ring.
He got it from his father, King Horik.
You look...
Lagertha, you look so beautiful.
This is always how I imagined this moment.
Wherever I am,
I don't ever want to forget how you looked on our wedding day.
Earl Kalf is dead.
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
LOTHBROK:
Previously on Vikings...
- What is your name?
- Yidu.
(SCREAMING)
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend Paris to the death.
(ARROWS WHOOSHING)
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a Viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, Father, nor does any man.
My name is Harald, but my people call me King Finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself King of all Norway!
In order to become King of all Norway, you would have to overthrow my husband.
(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)
- (ARROW WHOOSHING) - (VASE SHATTERING)
(CROWD CHEERING)
That was impressive.
I modified the Frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The Franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.

(CHANTING CONTINUES)

ALL:
Ahhh!
(WEAPONS CLINKING)
Bjorn must have murdered our Berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in Ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
- Through Torvi?
- Of course, through Torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
(GRUNTS)
- (WEAPONS CLINKING) - (GRUNTS)
WOMAN: (IN DISTANCE) Ahhh!
Lagertha must never know what we did.
(STRUGGLING)
Who would tell her?
Hmm?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven Torvi for leaving him.
- Really?
- Hmm.
LAGERTHA:
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
(CHUCKLES)
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, Lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known that we were fated to be together.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Lagertha?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
- (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) - (BIRDS CHIRPING)
Who is he?
(SIGHS) You heard.
He's a king.
From Tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
(THUDDING)
Why do you not care for your daughter Siggy?
(BOAT CREAKING)
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man takes a mother away from her child?
(ROPE THUDDING)
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
No.
VIKING 5:
I need a bit more slack on the sail.
(WHISPERS) I have definitely failed at being a husband.
- (CHUCKLES)

Need a hand?
VIKING 5:
Take more than that.

No, three will do.

- HARALD:
I want that close to me.
- (PADDLES THUDDING)
VIKING 3:
Why would we?
VIKING 5:
Oil these oars!
How many boats and men do you have?
WOMAN:
More?
No, take more.
Take one more.
I will go get one.
Do you have enough?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told Ragnar mine is a small kingdom for now.
VIKING 1:
Better for the night.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother Halfdan is bringing them.
VIKING 3:
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
(LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING) He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
WOMAN 1:
And this one is rotten at the bottom.
Look!
WOMAN 2:
Take it out.
We'll take it back.
WOMAN 1:
It won't last a week in the rain.
VIKING 1:
These ones are dry there.
VIKING 3:
Here.
And more.

Ah, thank you.
I'll mend these.

It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.

Paris.
You must be excited to be going back.
(SOFTLY) No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(SIGHS)
And nobody knows.
My father's the Emperor.
(LAUGHS)
- (SHOUTING AND LAUGHING) - (MUSIC CONTINUES)
They say he left Kattegat a boy and came back a man.
Killed a bear with his bare hands.
With his own hands?
Hmm.
(MUSIC STOPS)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Who is that?
It is Floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me, he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, Floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.
- All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet Christian.
- Floki!

I talk to you.
By the way, that was Erlendur's ring.

Previously on Vikings...
- What is your name?
- Yidu.
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend Paris to the death.
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a Viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, Father, nor does any man.
My name is Harald, but my people call me King Finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself King of all Norway!
In order to become King of all Norway, you would have to overthrow my husband.
That was impressive.
I modified the Frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The Franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.
_
_
_
Ahhh!
Bjorn must have murdered our Berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in Ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
- Through Torvi?
- Of course, through Torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
Ahhh!
Lagertha must never know what we did.
Who would tell her?
Hmm?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven Torvi for leaving him.
- Really?
- Hmm.
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, Lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known that we were fated to be together.
Lagertha?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
Who is he?
You heard.
He's a king.
From Tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
Why do you not care for your daughter Siggy?
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man takes a mother away from her child?
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
No.
I need a bit more slack on the sail.
I have definitely failed at being a husband.
Need a hand?
Take more than that.
No, three will do.
- Bring it here.
- Where do you think?
I want that close to me.
Why would we?
Oil these oars!
How many boats and men do you have?
More?
No, take more.
Take one more.
I will go get one.
Do you have enough?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told Ragnar mine is a small kingdom for now.
Better for the night.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother Halfdan is bringing them.
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
And this one is rotten at the bottom.
Look!
Take it out.
We'll take it back.
It won't last a week in the rain.
These ones are dry there.
Here.
And more.
Ah, thank you.
I'll mend these.
And then pass it down.
Rider!
How many are there?
Open the gates!
Werferth.
We are met to decide how to deal with Mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now is a full-scale invasion of their kingdom.
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring Queen Kwenthrith to her throne,
I think we must explore it.
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as "W"?
Let me help you please, Sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
"W" stands for Wigstan.
He has royal blood, as well as being one of the most powerful warlords in Mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the Ruling Council.
No.
Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
My Lord, no one should ever trust Wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not!
The only way forward, the only choice now, is for both of you noble kings to raise your armies and invade Mercia and rid my kingdom of all the factions who want to ruin me!
Me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.
I agree with the Queen.
There is no other choice now.
Huh.
So it seems.
Very well.
We shall take your advice.
Wife, come to bed.
I said...
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
Very well.
Then go sleep with my father, you whore!
Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the Queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
Go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
You are husband to me in name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.
We had an argument.
Aethelwulf?
He called me your whore, which I am and have freely chosen to be.
Do you want me to leave?
This was my wife's ring.
My wife died in childbirth.
I cannot tell you the pain of it.
And I was resolved never to marry again.
But I would like you to wear it
if you will.
The forts have been built according to your instructions, Your Grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
What has become clear to both the Emperor and myself is that, if we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the Marne, the Seine, and the Yonne rivers, and the country would lie open as far as Reims.
We must hold Paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns, everything will be decided here.
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands and set up my own court.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
I know.
A man can dream, can he not, of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
He has Count Odo.
I don't like Count Odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course, it's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the Emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward kills a man by stabbing him in the back.
That is what a Viking would say!
But you are no longer a Viking.
In Frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.
Something you'll certainly have to learn.
You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your Highness, forgive me,
I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
You mean Count Odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt and just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled that you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
An Emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
Do...
Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards, if at all, to his wife.
Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.
For God's sake!
How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.
Is it true?
Yes, Your Highness.
And?
Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition to replace me?
To become
Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become Emperor.
Then...
Then I beg you, please, stay close, to Count Odo.
Report to me anything which might signal his treachery.
Now, go!
Leave me!
Is this how you looked?
Yes.
Though my hair was much shorter.
What is the name of your kingdom?
China.
And who rules it?
The Emperor Dezong, of the Tang Dynasty.
I want to know about your father.
My father was a...
A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the Emperor?
Tell me about him.
The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
...with his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.
Are you one of the Emperor's daughters?
- My father was a merchant.
- I know.
You told me that before.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.
Mmm-hmm?
I can share your burden.
Mmm.
I am small, but I have broad shoulders and I am not afraid.
I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.
All right.
Then give me more of that medicine.
So we are agreed, we'll raise an army and attack Mercia.
There is no alternative, my Lord Aelle.
Not if we wish to see Queen Kwenthrith placed once more upon the throne.
Travel safely, my Lord.
You are the best of allies.
I'm a simple man at heart, but full of conviction.
Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, Father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.
Remember your duties, say your prayers, and banish the Devil from your thoughts.
Such good advice, my Lord Aelle.
Farewell.
King Ecbert?
Front King's Guard!
- Yes, Queen Kwenthrith?
- All men forward!
Move out!
I need to know that I can trust you.
That you will do what you promised me.
Why would you doubt me?
You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.
Lord,
you know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness, like a fallen angel, to suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, Lord, that I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night, of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?
And yet,
I would sup with the Devil if he would show me how to achieve my earthly goals.
Your kingdom, Lord, as you have said, is not of this world, but my kingdom is.
Bjorn Ironside, come and sit with me.
We should talk to one another.
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to trust you.
You have told me of your ambitions.
I will never give you any cause to kill me.
That is not for you to say.
I may find cause where others may not.
Who knows?
But for now anyway, we are allies.
And we shall go together to Paris.
And we shall fight together.
Is it not so?
You and Ragnar need my warriors.
You need my ships.
I can't wait for Paris,
Bjorn Ironside.
I cannot wait.
We shall destroy those Christian folk!
They have seen nothing yet.
We are the masters now!
- Is it not so?
- Yes!
Yeah!
- Is it not so?
- Yes!
- A boat's come in!
- They're here!
- Bring him in!
- Over here!
- Brother.
- Brother!
This is Kattegat!
This is Kattegat.
Come.
King Ragnar, this is my brother Halfdan.
Meet the notorious King Ragnar.
It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.
Faster!

- Not to him.
- No, you...

To me!
Come on!
Here!
Do not be afraid.
It's not your fault.
Everything is all right.
Everything will be all right.
What is that?

Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the Queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
- (GROANS)
- Go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You are husband to me in name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.

ODO:
The forts have been built according to your instructions, Your Grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
ODO:
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
ROLLO:
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
ODO:
What has become clear to both the Emperor and myself is that, if we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the Marne, the Seine, and the Yonne rivers, and the country would lie open as far as Reims.
ROLLO:
We must hold Paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns, everything will be decided here.
(POURING)
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands and set up my own court.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
ROLLO:
I know.
A man can dream, can he not, of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
(SIGHS) He has Count Odo.
I don't like Count Odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course, it's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the Emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward
(INHALES) kills a man by stabbing him in the back.
That is what a Viking would say!
But you are no longer a Viking.
In Frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.

Your Highness, forgive me,

CHARLES:
You mean Count Odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt and just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled that you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
(BIRDS SHRIEKING IN DISTANCE)
An Emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
(SHOUTING) Do...
Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards,

Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.

How should I trust the evidence of this woman?

Yes, Your Highness.
And?
Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition
(STUTTERING) to replace me?
To become
Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become Emperor.

My father was a...
A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the Emperor?
Tell me about him.
The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
With his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.

You are the best of allies.
AELLE:
I'm a simple man at heart,

Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, Father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.

Farewell.

You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.

Lord,
you know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness, like a fallen angel,
to suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, Lord, that I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night, of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?

That is not for you to say.
I may find cause where others may not.

(SOFTLY) No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
(INHALES DEEPLY)

Yes, Floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.

So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?

Previously on vikings...
- What is your name?
- Yidu.
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend paris to the death.
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, father, nor does any man.
My name is harald, but my people call me king finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself king of all norway!
In order to become king of all norway,
You would have to overthrow my husband.
That was impressive.
I modified the frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.
Bjorn must have murdered our berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
- Through torvi?
- Of course, through torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
Lagertha must never know what we did.
Who would tell her?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven torvi for leaving him.
Really?
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known.
That we were fated to be together.
Lagertha?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
Who is he?
You heard.
He's a king.
From tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
Why do you not care for your daughter siggy?
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man.
Takes a mother away from her child?
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
I need a bit more slack on the sail.
I have definitely failed at being a husband.
Need a hand?
Take more than that.
No, three will do.
I want that close to me.
Why would we?
Oil these oars!
How many boats and men do you have?
More?
No, take more.
Take one more.
I will go get one.
Do you have enough?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told ragnar mine is a small kingdom.
For now.
Better for the night.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother halfdan is bringing them.
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, bjorn lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame.
Won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
And this one is rotten at the bottom.
Look!
Take it out.
We'll take it back.
It won't last a week in the rain.
These ones are dry there.
Here.
And more.
Thank you.
I'll mend these.
And then pass it down.
Rider!
How many are there?
Open the gates!
Werferth.
We are met to decide how to deal with mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now.
Is a full-scale invasion.
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring queen kwenthrith to her throne,
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as "w"?
Let me help you please, sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom.
Are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
"W" stands for wigstan.
As well as being one of the most powerful warlords in mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the ruling council.
No.
Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
My lord,
No one should ever trust wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not!
The only way forward,
The only choice now,
Is for both of you noble kings.
To raise your armies.
And invade mercia.
And rid my kingdom.
Of all the factions who want to ruin me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.
I agree with the queen.
There is no other choice now.
So it seems.
Very well.
We shall take your advice.
Wife,
Come to bed.
I said...
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
Very well.
Then go sleep with my father,
Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
Go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
You are husband to me.
In name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.
We had an argument.
Aethelwulf?
He called me your whore,
Which I am.
And have freely chosen to be.
Do you want me to leave?
This was my wife's ring.
My wife died in childbirth.
I cannot tell you the pain of it.
And I was resolved.
Never to marry again.
But I would like you.
To wear it.
If you will.
The forts have been built according to your instructions, your grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain.
Which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
What has become clear to both the emperor and myself.
Is that, if we were to lose paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the marne, the seine, and the yonne rivers,
And the country would lie open as far as reims.
We must hold paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.

Everything will be decided here.
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
I know.

I don't like count odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course,
It's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward.
Kills a man.
By stabbing him in the back.
That is what a viking would say!
But you are no longer a viking.
In frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.
Something you'll certainly have to learn.
You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your highness, forgive me,
I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
You mean count odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt.
And just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled.
That you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
An emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
Do...
Do you have any proof of this?

And, as your highness knows,
A man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress,
And only afterwards, if at all,
To his wife.

How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.

Yes, your highness.
Does count odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.

To become.

Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become emperor.

He has fallen out with king ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.
- All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world,
And helped made ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet christian.
Floki!
Skol.
To new friendships.
Skol!
Skol!
Skol.
- My turn!
- Here, catch it!
Mine!
Ivar, do you want to play?
Got it!
It's mine, give it back!
Now you go!
Here!
To me!
Throw it!
Here!
Give it here!
- Not to him.
- No, you...
Higher!
My turn!
To me!
Come on!
Here!
Do not be afraid.
It's not your fault.
Everything is all right.
Everything will be all right.
What is that?
Can I see?
Where did you find this?
I took it from someone.
Why are you so interested?
I want to talk to you.
What about?
Us.
We have moments when I feel so close to you,
Especially when you're inside me, but then you don't want to talk,
And I wonder why you really came for me.
And took me away from my child.
Torvi.
I talk to you.
By the way,
That was erlendur's ring.
He got it from his father, king horik.
You look...
Lagertha, you look so beautiful.
This is always how I imagined this moment.
Wherever I am,
I don't ever want to forget how you looked on our wedding day.
Earl kalf is dead.
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Long live earl ingstad!
Previously on Vikings...
- What is your name?
- Yidu.
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
My destiny is to be with you.
I am prepared to defend Paris to the death.
You have betrayed your own kind!
I came to deliver my precious son into your hands.
Teach him to be a Viking.
I see some gross and indecent familiarity between you and your father-in-law.
You don't own me, Father, nor does any man.
My name is Harald, but my people call me King Finehair.
Why have you come here?
I'm making myself King of all Norway!
In order to become King of all Norway, you would have to overthrow my husband.
That was impressive.
I modified the Frankish weapon.
It has a much greater range now.
The Franks will not expect to be attacked by their own weapon.
_
_
_
Ahhh!
Bjorn must have murdered our Berserker.
It's a pity.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
How can you say so?
Because we have eyes in Ragnar's household.
Anything we need to know, we'll find out.
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.
The time to strike.
- Through Torvi?
- Of course, through Torvi.
Otherwise, I'll kill her child.
She knows I'll do it, too!
Ahhh!
Lagertha must never know what we did.
Who would tell her?
Hmm?
What were you two talking about?
Erlendur was telling me how he has forgiven Torvi for leaving him.
- Really?
- Hmm.
That young man still surprises me sometimes.
I, too, have a surprise.
I am with child.
That makes me so very happy.
Me too.
More than I can say.
Although it is still early days.
Marry me, Lagertha.
Marry me.
I have always known that we were fated to be together.
Lagertha?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Say that you'll marry me.
Who is he?
You heard.
He's a king.
From Tamdrup, wherever that is.
And you trust him?
No!
I don't trust him either.
Why do you not care for your daughter Siggy?
I care for her.
She just reminds me of things I'd rather forget.
What kind of man takes a mother away from her child?
You tell me.
You tried to take me away from my mother.
That is not the way it went.
If you remember, your mother left me.
You left me.
It is not easy being a father.
It is even harder being a husband.
Maybe I have failed at both.
No.
I have definitely failed at being a husband.
How many boats and men do you have?
Twenty boats.
About 600 men.
I told Ragnar mine is a small kingdom for now.
And when will they arrive?
They must already be on their way.
My brother Halfdan is bringing them.
Is your brother like you?
No.
He's much worse.
He's much worse!
You have such ambitions.
What else is there?
What are we here for except to achieve fame, just like your father?
Isn't that what you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?
Be honest.
You don't know me.
And fame won't make your small kingdom any bigger.
Rider!
How many are there?
Open the gates!
Werferth.
We are met to decide how to deal with Mercia.
Now, I am almost decided that the only way now is a full-scale invasion of their kingdom.
And, yet, if there were some other way of restoring Queen Kwenthrith to her throne,
I think we must explore it.
Have you any more idea of the identity of the nobleman you knew as "W"?
Let me help you please, Sire.
The warring factions of my kingdom are always known by the first letter of their leader's name.
"W" stands for Wigstan.
He has royal blood, as well as being one of the most powerful warlords in Mercia.
Yet he is obviously not part of the Ruling Council.
No.
Wigstan would find it unbearable to belong to any group.
His interests are always personal.
Then you don't trust him?
Trust him?
My Lord, no one should ever trust Wigstan!
So there is no dealing with him?
Absolutely not!
The only way forward, the only choice now, is for both of you noble kings to raise your armies and invade Mercia and rid my kingdom of all the factions who want to ruin me!
Me!
The only legitimate ruler of that poor, ravaged, raped and abused land.
I agree with the Queen.
There is no other choice now.
Huh.
So it seems.
Very well.
We shall take your advice.
Wife, come to bed.
I said...
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
Very well.
Then go sleep with my father, you whore!
Yes, yes, and why don't you go and sleep with your mistress, the Queen.
Gives you another reason to flagellate yourself!
Go on.
Hit me.
Hit me if it pleases you, husband.
But it makes no difference, either to you or me.
You are husband to me in name only, as I am wife to you.
But you're otherwise free to do as you will.
We had an argument.
Aethelwulf?
He called me your whore, which I am and have freely chosen to be.
Do you want me to leave?
This was my wife's ring.
My wife died in childbirth.
I cannot tell you the pain of it.
And I was resolved never to marry again.
But I would like you to wear it
if you will.
The forts have been built according to your instructions, Your Grace.
Eventually there will be an iron chain which can be raised between them to prevent the passage of any boat upriver.
We should still place some boats beyond this barrier, in case they break through.
Hopefully they will be unable to do so.
You don't know my people like I do.
They don't recognize any barriers, except as obstacles to be overcome.
What has become clear to both the Emperor and myself is that, if we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
For then the enemy would command the Marne, the Seine, and the Yonne rivers, and the country would lie open as far as Reims.
We must hold Paris whatever the cost.
There is no alternative.
No other choice.
When my brother returns, everything will be decided here.
I cannot wait to take control of my northern lands and set up my own court.
You have some business here first, remember?
Some family business.
I know.
A man can dream, can he not, of dancing naked on the sand?
In any case, my father needs you.
He needs a strong man to support him and to guide him.
He has Count Odo.
I don't like Count Odo.
Nor do I trust him.
Of course, it's possible that he could die in the fighting.
Slain by some unknown assailant.
And then the Emperor would just have to rely more on you.
Only a coward kills a man by stabbing him in the back.
That is what a Viking would say!
But you are no longer a Viking.
In Frankia, we do certain things differently.
That is something you'll have to learn, my love.
Something you'll certainly have to learn.
You asked for a private audience.
Why?
Your Highness, forgive me,
I am reluctant to discuss matters which relate directly to my superior.
You mean Count Odo?
Then absolve yourself of any guilt and just say what you have to say.
Highness, I am troubled that you always trust his word.
Why?
Should...
Should I not trust his word?
Because he is not always worth believing.
Why, pray, is he not worth believing?
Because he is ambitious.
Ambitious beyond ambitious.
So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.
An Emperor's crown?
I cannot believe it!
What...
What are you saying?
Do...
Do you have any proof of this?
I have the word of his mistress.
And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards, if at all, to his wife.
Very well.
Let me talk to his mistress.
For God's sake!
How should I trust the evidence of this woman?
Because this woman is my sister.
Is it true?
Yes, Your Highness.
And?
Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?
Yes, he does.
Very freely.
His ambition to replace me?
To become
Emperor?
Yes, exactly.
His ambition to become Emperor.
Then...
Then I beg you, please, stay close, to Count Odo.
Report to me anything which might signal his treachery.
Now, go!
Leave me!
Is this how you looked?
Yes.
Though my hair was much shorter.
What is the name of your kingdom?
China.
And who rules it?
The Emperor Dezong, of the Tang Dynasty.
I want to know about your father.
My father was a...
A merchant.
Well respected.
Rich enough to own a boat.
What about the Emperor?
Tell me about him.
The Emperor had many daughters...
Mmm.
...with his wives and concubines.
His concubines were looked after by the palace eunuchs.
Eunuchs?
Men who are not men.
Why are they not men?
Their manhood was cut off.
I don't like that.
No.
They didn't like it either.
Are you one of the Emperor's daughters?
- My father was a merchant.
- I know.
You told me that before.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.
Mmm-hmm?
I can share your burden.
Mmm.
I am small, but I have broad shoulders and I am not afraid.
I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.
All right.
Then give me more of that medicine.
So we are agreed, we'll raise an army and attack Mercia.
There is no alternative, my Lord Aelle.
Not if we wish to see Queen Kwenthrith placed once more upon the throne.
Travel safely, my Lord.
You are the best of allies.
I'm a simple man at heart, but full of conviction.
Your convictions, do you credit.
Farewell, my child.
Take heed of what I've told you.
I will always listen to you, Father.
But also to my own conscience, and weigh such things in the balance, as it pleases you.
It does not always please me.
But enough!
Women are frail.
Farewell, children.
Remember your duties, say your prayers, and banish the Devil from your thoughts.
Such good advice, my Lord Aelle.
Farewell.
King Ecbert?
- Yes, Queen Kwenthrith?
I need to know that I can trust you.
That you will do what you promised me.
Why would you doubt me?
You've heard me speak plainly and in public.
I doubt you for one reason only.
And that is that you and I are somewhat alike.
Then do not judge yourself too harshly.
Lord,
you know me for a sinner.
And I think you have already decided to cast me out into the darkness, like a fallen angel, to suffer in purgatory, or the fires of hell, for all eternity.
Think you, Lord, that I can look upon such scenes with equanimity?
That I do not dream, in the dead of night, of returning to your light and the promises of heaven?
Am I not a man like other men?
And yet,
I would sup with the Devil if he would show me how to achieve my earthly goals.
Your kingdom, Lord, as you have said, is not of this world, but my kingdom is.
Bjorn Ironside, come and sit with me.
We should talk to one another.
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to trust you.
You have told me of your ambitions.
I will never give you any cause to kill me.
That is not for you to say.
I may find cause where others may not.
Who knows?
But for now anyway, we are allies.
And we shall go together to Paris.
And we shall fight together.
Is it not so?
You and Ragnar need my warriors.
You need my ships.
I can't wait for Paris,
Bjorn Ironside.
I cannot wait.
We shall destroy those Christian folk!
They have seen nothing yet.
We are the masters now!
- Is it not so?
- Yes!
Yeah!
- Is it not so?
- Yes!
- A boat's come in!
- They're here!
- Bring him in!
- Over here!
- Brother.
- Brother!
This is Kattegat!
This is Kattegat.
Come.
King Ragnar, this is my brother Halfdan.
Meet the notorious King Ragnar.
It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.
Faster!
Argh!
They'll be wondering where you are.
I doubt it.
What are you thinking about?
Paris.
You must be excited to be going back.
No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
And nobody knows.
My father's the Emperor.
They say he left Kattegat a boy and came back a man.
Killed a bear with his bare hands.
With his own hands?
Hmm.
Who is that?
It is Floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me, he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, Floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.
- All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet Christian.
Floki!
Skol.
To new friendships.
Skol!
Skol!
Skol.
Mine!
Ivar, do you want to play?
It's mine, give it back!
Now you go!
Here!
To me!
Throw it!
Here!
Give it here!
- Not to him.
- No, you...
Higher!
My turn!
To me!
Come on!
Here!
Do not be afraid.
It's not your fault.
Everything is all right.
Everything will be all right.
What is that?

King Ragnar, this is my brother Halfdan.
Meet the notorious King Ragnar.
It's a great honor.
When do we sail for Paris?
You seem eager to fight.
Yes, it's true.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.
And against the Christians, yes.
I hate the Christians.
In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.
You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.
Faster!
They'll be wondering where you are.
I doubt it.
What are you thinking about?
Paris.
You must be excited to be going back.
No.
I feel so old.
When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
I have lost the desire.
And the strength.
A few years ago I established a settlement in a distant country where I took many of my people and friends to make a new life for themselves.
But shortly after my departure, they were all slaughtered.
Their homes destroyed and burned.
I live with such guilt because of it.
And nobody knows.
My father's the Emperor.
They say he left Kattegat a boy and came back a man.
Killed a bear with his bare hands.
With his own hands?
Who is that?
It is Floki, the boat builder.
For some reason no one will tell me, he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
Ask him.
Floki.
Boat builder.
Sit down with us.
Yes, Floki.
Sit down.
Make room.
Both of you join us.
- Fill the horns.
- Sup.
This is my younger brother, Halfdan.
- He's keen to know you.
- All right.
So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
Because I killed his pet Christian.
Floki!
Skol.
To new friendships.
Skol!
Skol!
Skol.
- My turn!
- Here, catch it!
Mine!
Ivar, do you want to play?
Got it!
It's mine, give it back!
Now you go!
Here!
To me!
Throw it!
Here!
Give it here!
- Not to him.
- No, you...
Higher!
My turn!
To me!
Come on!
Here!
Do not be afraid.
It's not your fault.
Everything is all right.
Everything will be all right.
What is that?
Can I see?
Where did you find this?
I took it from someone.
Why are you so interested?
I want to talk to you.
What about?
Us.
We have moments when I feel so close to you, especially when you're inside me, but then you don't want to talk, and I wonder why you really came for me and took me away from my child.
Torvi.
I talk to you.
By the way, that was Erlendur's ring.
He got it from his father, King Horik.
You look...
Lagertha, you look so beautiful.
This is always how I imagined this moment.
Wherever I am,
I don't ever want to forget how you looked on our wedding day.
Earl Kalf is dead.
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!
This is he story of my family...
The O'Neals.
We just came from church.
As always, we're on our best behavior, and that's 100% due to my mom, Eileen.
Kenny.
Four on the floor.
Sorry.
Yep.
I'm the rebel.
What a lovely family.
Aren't they?
What I can get for you, sir?
Jimmy will have the skinless chicken breast with the steamed broccoli.
He has to make weight for his wrestling match.
St. Barclay's.
Go, bulldogs!
- And for you, Si...
- My husband will have the salmon with a lemon wedge.
Can't have meat and potatoes for every meal.
Not till I'm in heaven.
Also, could you donate your tips to poor children in Ethiopia?
Shannon, honey, don't be pushy.
Karen needs to make her own moral decisions.
It's her soul that's going to hell if she doesn't give you money.
My shift just started.
My mom always told us to behave as if Jesus were watching.
What are you getting, Kenny?
Uh, she usually just orders for me, so...
Smart.
I'm gonna let her order for me, too, but then I'm just gonna turn it into whatever I want.
Mm.
That's the life.
Jesus wasn't really there, you guys, but you get it.
We were different than other families.
But I was about to change all that.
We were gonna go from this...
To this.
Use your core.
Use your core!
They're coming for us!
Shannon is doing nothing!
Oh, where the hell is the car?
!
Aaaaaaaaah!
The wheels started to fall off the night before our church's biggest fundraiser...
Bingo bonanza.
My mom was chair of the event.
It combined two of the things she loved the most...
Serving the church and having everyone watch her do it.
That is how you make an easy nine-finger articulated medallion bow.
My dad was bringing home the mother of all donations and the donation my mother cared about most of all...
A ride-along with the Chicago P.D.
I didn't get the ride-along.
What?
!
Why not?
Because apparently, we're being sued after the last one.
You think you're so tough up there?
Why?
'Cause you're protected by this cage?
Well, I'm-a find you, dentist!
I'm-a find you, I'm-a kill you!
Don't listen to him.
He's a drama queen.
You think I'm playin', son?
!
What about the silent auction?
The ride-along was our big-ticket item.
Now we don't have our big-ticket item.
Jodi.
It's okay.
I didn't get to be chair of the bingo bonanza by losing my cool.
Hmm?
Pat.
Since you couldn't get the ride-along,
I think there's something else we could auction off.
Not my canoe!
We've had this thing for seven years, and it's never even touched water.
But it could.
And look, I hope this doesn't sound too extreme, but this canoe symbolizes all my hopes and dreams.
I bet we could get 3 grand for it.
Eileen!
Let's talk about it.
We never talk about things, and then I end up getting railroaded into giving up my canoe.
Okay.
But I invited the bishop to bingo bonanza.
I was hoping that he'd see how generous we are and then he'd write a recommendation for Jimmy to go to Notre Dame so he wouldn't end up living with us for the rest of his life because he's a little dumb.
See that?
That's Irish-Catholic jedi mind control.
This is tremendous.
Eileen, I'd like to honor all your hard work by featuring the O'Neals in the church bulletin.
So do you have a recent family photo?
Of course I do.
I'll get you a flash drive.
While Father Phil was looking through 1,000 of the exact same photos,
I was in my bedroom with my handsy girlfriend, Mimi.
I love Peta.
Mm.
But...
We have been dating for six months, and you have never once pressured me to have sex.
Which is why I want to have sex.
Uh, b-but Father Phil is downstairs, and he's wearing his collar.
I don't care.
I'm half-Jewish.
Whoa.
Uh, that's 48 condoms.
12 didn't seem like enough.
Are you sure you understand how they work?
Kenny.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Where are you going?
Um...
To put one of these on.
But you can do that in here.
But...
I want to make an entrance, So...
Okay.
Okay.
I can do this.
I can do this.
What's the problem?
Why am I so nervous?
I don't know.
Why do you think?
What are you doing in my mirror, shirtless cologne model?
You tell me.
Hey.
Come out, Kenny!
Yeah, Kenny.
Why don't you come out?
I can't come out.
Have you ever met my mom?
She put a statue of the Virgin Mary over the toilet so we'd put the seat down.
That's intense.
You're intense.
No, but it will literally kill her.
So...
I can't be gay... ever.
I need to learn how to do it...
With a girl.
Straight sex.
I can do this.
Do you have it on yet?
Does it fit?
Nope.
Can't do this.
That's a... bad idea, man.
I'm out of here.
Wait!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Ohh!
Oh, god.
No!
Oh, god.
Uggggggh!
Come on, girl.
Help me out.
I finally got the bow right!
We're still in the bulletin, though, right?
The good news is, almost everyone was blinded by plaster dust and didn't see the condoms.
The bad news is my mom was now convinced that I'd sinned with Mimi.
Where's our regular plumber?
I had to call in a stranger.
We need to keep this Kenny thing contained.
You know how gossipy plumbers are.
Hey.
What do you think Mom's gonna do to me?
Who cares?
What did Mimi do to you?
Oh.
Just... you know, just... all that sex stuff that drives us wild.
Yeah!
She did, man!
No matter what she tells you, you're not going to hell.
Trust me.
If everything she said was true,
I would be so blind by now.
Whoa!
She looks pissed.
Good luck.
Just let me take the lead.
Please?
Be my guest.
Go right ahead.
Okay, so, some things happened last night that I think we need to talk about.
You are in a heap of trouble, young man.
I know out in the rest of the world, kids are humping to hip-hop, but not in this house.
Eileen.
Father Phil was here...
In his collar!
I told Mimi that, but she was unmoved by that argument.
Zip it!
I have a lot more statues of the Blessed Virgin in the basement, Kenny...
Big ones.
Let me tell you how this ends.
- Here it comes.
- If you get Mimi pregnant, then you won't be able to go to Northwestern and become the youngest judge in Illinois history, like we always talked about.
And I want that for you.
Because you're my favorite.
Eileen!
Fine.
Sure.
They're all my favorites.
Hey, Jodi.
Thanks.
How's things after last night?
- Things are good.
- Good.
Because I just got out of cardio salsa at the church, and people were talking about Kenny and Mimi.
What?
Guess who was yammering on the most.
Marcia bleeping Worthman.
Well, apparently, they found Mimi in her underwear with hundreds of Kenny's condoms plugging their pipes.
Are you kidding?
No.
Those moves are hard.
I think I pulled my vagina muscle.
Do women have groins?
This is nice.
Well, now everyone's gonna know.
We need to nip this in the bud.
I agree.
So I was thinking...
I have this cousin back in Philly with a very questionable past who would do anything for me.
And by "anything," I mean like...
"Kill Marcia Worthman."
Wow.
Well, we're not gonna do that, but I like that you're thinking.
- Can you put that in the front for me?
- Yeah.
Hey.
I'm gonna go watch the hockey game at Clifford's.
No.
It's out there.
I need you to handle this Kenny thing...
The way you handle things.
My dad's way of handling parenting stuff was to bring us to work.
He wants us to be responsible drivers,
He takes us to a crash site.
See that hand?
It's still texting.
Hey, I got a bleeder!
Who wants ice cream?
Express it out of here!
He doesn't want me to have premarital sex?
He takes me to Crystal.
She was in the middle of telling me her sex-worker origin story, and I have to admit...
I was zoning out, until I heard...
Why do you want to have sex with your girlfriend?
I mean, honey, clearly, you're gay.
What?
Where... where... where are you getting that?
What?
How's it going?
Great.
Super.
Uh, thanks, Crystal.
Good talk.
Bye.
So that happened.
And then we went to bingo night, otherwise known as
"the night where my mom tries to make everyone forget about the sex I didn't have with Mimi."
Okay.
This is a big night.
And not just for me, but for our entire family.
I know we've had an eventful 24 hours, but now we're over the hump.
It's funny 'cause you said "hump."
- No.
- No.
Okay.
All right, let's be our best selves.
Pat, sell that canoe.
Jimmy, tuck in your shirt.
Shannon, push those bingo cards.
And you...
Keep it in your pants.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Shannon.
Welcome.
I will take four cards, please.
But everyone's looking to you to set the bar.
You got to go high, Father Phil.
Well, I took a vow of poverty.
Does your Lexus know that?
Well-played, child.
Everything is beautiful.
If god played bingo, this is where he'd do it.
I'd...
like to think so.
Good evening, Father.
Ugh.
It's Marcia Worthman and her big mouth.
How's my fake smile?
- Great.
How's mine?
- Mm.
- Tight.
- Mm.
Eileen.
Congrats on your little bingo night.
It's amazing you were able to do this in light of the Kenny situation.
Yeah.
Well, thank you, Marcia.
I do what I can for the church.
Mimi started it!
That skinny little tramp is all hands.
What?
There's an emergency?
Oh!
I'll be right there.
Okay.
You know, it's hard, Eileen.
Kids seem like they're going on the right path, then they can just...
Veer off.
Well, my kids are all on the right path, so...
So...
So...
I'm not forcing you to break up, but, because I care about you,
I want you to spend the rest of the evening getting a glimpse of what your future could be.
By the way, they can smell fear.
Good luck!
Oh!
Nothing better than mashed potatoes.
Just pour that gravy like you mean it.
Oh!
Hello, corn on the cob.
Ahh!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, beautiful.
Honey, honey.
Isn't this beautiful?
We have to bid on this.
Hey.
Wow, look at this, huh?
- Great canoe, huh?
- Yeah.
You know what's crazy is, I was gonna bid on it earlier, but then I heard that the West Nile virus is back.
- Can you believe that?
- Ohh.
I don't know.
It's just, you put two and two together.
The canoe's got to go in the water, right?
My question to you is, how's your immunity?
Are they bidding?
Fingers crossed.
Everything's going smoothly.
The chicken's cooked all the
- way through this year.
- Hey.
And the gossip's quieting down.
And the bishop will be here soon, so I can ask him about that letter for Jimmy for Notre Dame, and I sent Kenny and Mimi to work in the nursery.
That'll scare them out of having sex for another 20 years.
I already scared them out of having sex.
Remember?
You can never be too scared.
Your mom's right.
This could be us one day.
Wouldn't that be awesome?
Uh...
Uh, Mimi?
Doesn't this all feel a little fast?
I mean, I had a really interesting talk with a prostitute today who made me think maybe we should, you know, slow things down a little bit.
You're telling me this now?
After we've had four kids and have another one on the way?
What are you talking about?
If you wanted to slow things down, you should have said something in high school.
Now let's put on a movie for the kids.
You know how horny I get when I'm pregnant.
Aaaaaaah!
It's just poop.
Yeah.
Right.
Holy crap.
I don't want to have four kids with Mimi.
I have to come out.
Yeah... now.
But I think that was primarily 'cause it smelled like socks and tacos.
Dad?
I need to talk to you.
What?
What's up?
Uh...
I have something pretty important to tell you.
I have tried to tell you this before.
No, actually, that's not true.
I've sort of started and then I've changed the subject.
But anyway, what I'm trying to say is...
And please...
Don't tell Mom yet.
I don't want to have sex with Mimi...
Or any other girl.
Vaginas scare me.
That feeling never goes away.
Thank you for that.
I'm not sure you understand what I'm saying.
No, I get it.
I thought I handled it by taking you to a prostitute, but that's not parenting.
And it stops now.
Eileen, what's your 20?
What are you doing?
We're having a family meeting.
Who's ready to play bingo?
Pat, can it wait?
Bingo's about to start.
I'm handing out daubers.
No.
There's a major problem with the brownie bar.
I'm on my way.
Knew that'd get her.
There's no problem with the brownie bar.
No, but there's a problem with us.
We don't talk about things.
Pat, there are 200 people out there.
Now is not the time for this.
It's never the time, but now works for me, so we're going with it.
Now, Kenny, this morning, you had a very healthy sexual appetite, and now you don't ever want to sleep with a woman.
Is that something you'd like to talk about?
Not a chance.
Okay, but I'm coming back to you.
No!
Now, look, I understand that this is uncomfortable because talking about real stuff isn't something we do, but we're gonna start, and I'll go first.
Pat, we are not doing this...
Your mother and I are in therapy.
We've been going every Tuesday night for a year.
I-I thought you were playing tennis.
Is this the body of a man who plays tennis?
I don't... really like looking at your body.
Thank you!
That's honesty.
All right.
Come on.
Who's next?
Somebody.
I think we're done here.
Why are you in therapy?
Well, it's, uh, complicated.
Pat!
Stop talking.
No!
Can't you see we're screwing up our kids with our whole Irish-Catholic not talking about things?
We can't corned-beef this, Eileen.
It's their lives, too.
Fine.
Fine!
You want to know why we're in therapy?
- No. - Mnh-mnh.
Because I made a mistake, okay?
On our second date, your father and I went to a Foreigner concert,
I smoked a joint, and I ended up getting pregnant with Jimmy.
- What?
!
- No way.
Who's foreigner?
And even though we didn't know each other very well, we got married because we wanted to do the right thing.
And we made it work...
For a while.
But it's not working anymore.
And so now we're getting a divorce.
There.
I said it.
Look, we're not perfect, okay?
I don't want them to think that they have to be, either.
Oh, my god.
This was it.
This was my moment.
- I...
- I'm anorexic!
What?
!
Oh!
Yeah.
Y-yep.
It started because of wrestling, but now I just like watching the numbers on the scale drop.
I mean, it is really hard not to shove those brownies in my face right now.
Okay, Jimmy, well, hey, listen, that's probably something we're gonna need to discuss further, but thanks for sharing.
I don't know if this is super-serious, but I haven't sent any of that money to Ethiopia.
I spent it all on a car I bought off Craigslist.
- What?
!
- Also a surprise.
I couldn't believe they sold it to a 14-year-old.
You can get anything you want if you pay all in cash.
What is happening here?
!
Uh... we're just...
Being ourselves, Eileen.
Okay.
Great.
So now we all know that we're getting a divorce,
Shannon's a thief, Jimmy doesn't eat.
What about you, Kenny?
Hmm?
You in the mob now?
You making meth in the basement?
I-I'm gay.
What?
I'm gay, Mom.
What?
I think Kenny said he's gay.
Twice.
And it also sounds like you're getting a divorce.
Unfortunately, the acoustics in here are amazing.
Do you want this open or closed?
I'll close it.
Sorry if I brought this up at a bad time.
No.
I started it.
Put these on.
We're leaving.
I don't think this is mine.
Now you care about stealing?
And there it was.
After all my mom's hard work, we'd gone from the perfect family in the church bulletin to the ones sneaking out the back, getting dirty looks from judgy nuns.
Eileen!
Oh, listen, tonight wasn't a total debacle.
In all the confusion over your family's, um, situation, bidding closed early, and I won your canoe.
Take care of her for me.
Oh, I will.
I think I might use it as a planter, maybe grow some zucchini in there.
Best $150 I've ever spent.
There's no way that bleeping is getting our canoe.
Use your core!
Use your core!
They're coming for us!
Shannon is doing nothing!
I can't raise my arms!
Where the hell is the car?
!
Eileen!
Eileen, stop!
Keep going!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Right now, right now.
Stop.
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down!
What are you doing?
I don't know!
Obviously!
I just stole a canoe from church, everyone in there knows we're getting a divorce, and my own son just told me he thinks he's...
Gay?
That's what he said.
We all heard him, right?
Yes, thank you, Jimmy.
I mean, I knew you'd flip out.
Well, what did you expect?
!
You dropped a bomb.
You all did!
We're sending that car to Africa, by the way.
Good, because I couldn't grind off the VIN number.
The sooner it's off my hands, the better.
How could all this happen without my knowing?
Mom, you don't make it easy.
Wait!
Don't forget this!
Guys, I know when your uncle Dwayne and I got divorced, it seemed like the worst thing ever, but look at me now.
I'm doing great.
And you guys are gonna be great, too.
You're gonna want to call dibs on Christmas.
I don't think I need...
Eileen calls Christmas!
But don't worry... everybody still gets a fruitcake.
Oh.
Sorry, Kenny.
Don't even worry about it.
I got to go call the numbers.
Mm.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Let's get this thing in the car.
Wait!
Eileen!
Listen.
Nobody wants this canoe as much as I do, okay?
But I am a cop, and this is stealing.
Pat, too many things are changing.
I need this canoe.
Our family needs this canoe.
This canoe symbolizes all our hopes and dreams, and it's going back in that garage!
You heard your mother, kids.
Use your core.
Let's go!
Give me the keys!
This is not a planter!
Shannon, get the door!
So, here we are.
Just your typical all-American, Catholic, divorcing, disgraced, lawbreaking, gay family.
And I guess you could say we were all finally out as who we really were.
Hey!
Roll down your window!
Stop the car!
Bishop Perez!
Thank you for coming!
It's such an honor!
This is my son Jimmy.
I was hoping you could write him a letter so he could get into Notre Dame.
Um... sure.
I have an eating disorder.
Okay, okay.
That's enough sharing for tonight, buddy.
I stole Marcia Worthman's purse.
- All right.
- Drive, Pat.
Drive fast.
Who the hell was that?
We're The O'Neals, damn it.
And we're a perfect mess.
So you're gay, huh?
Yeah.
And you listen to Katy Perry because you like her music, not because she's hot?
Yeah.
That's interesting.
What is it you miss most about eating?
Waffles.
And the chewing.
Actually, I have a question for you.
You're a gay guy.
So you're into style...
And stuff.
W... when you look at me, is there any...
- Your hair.
- Okay.
You didn't let me finish.
It's awful.
You're a thief!
A thief with good hair.
I hate you guys.
Who are you?
What do you want?
I was looking for someone.
The door was open.
Is everything okay?
My girlfriend's gone missing.
She left.
I...
I don't know.
Do you know where she went?
No.
I don't.
Do you want me to help you find her?
You know where she is.
You know where she is, don't you?
[groaning] [coughing]
[Parker] You're home now, Agatha.
You're safe.
Do you have any?
I need it.
I need it.
Do you have any?
Why do you need it so badly?
- Why do you need the Guidance?
- [groans]
Guidance is the only thing that makes the pain go away.
[sniffles, groans]
It's the only thing that makes me feel.
Agatha, why did you leave the compound?
Please?
Why did you... why did you...
Agatha, look at me.
- Why did you get on that bus?
- Please?
Did Logan... did he say anything to you to influence your decision?
Please?
I'll tell you everything you need to know.
Just help me.
Please?
Please?
Why would you think I know where your girlfriend is?
That's weird.
Why have I never seen you?
Maybe you weren't looking.
They taught you how to do that, didn't they, at the institute?
Taught me what?
What institute?
How to... act normal, fake everything.
You're the Genesis patient.
[scoffs]
You never even knew how to be natural.
That was their goal.
You never had limits.
You don't know anything about me.
I know that you were... made... by a committee in a lab.
Where is she?
[knocking]
- Yeah?
- Hey.
Do you want to come out and meet some of my friends?
Just casual.
Um, not really.
Just for a second?
Please?
They think you're hot!
[chuckles]
Yeah.
If they only knew...
Yeah.
That's what I said.
Um, let me clean up, okay?
Okay.
[Parker] So none of you... called the police or anything like that, right?
No.
No, nothing like that.
Not even Ryder?
Ryder isn't like that, Parker.
- Why isn't he like that?
- [scoffs]
Because he's afraid of what you're capable of.
He shouldn't be afraid.
I hate that he's afraid.
I hate it too.
And that's why we need to get him back, right?
[softly] Yeah.
We never should've left.
It wasn't your fault.
It wasn't your fault.
It was Logan.
How would I know where your girlfriend is... if I don't even know you?
No, we haven't met, but I know what you...
Fuck!
Fuck!
[coughing]
[groans]
[gasping]
[engine starts]
[chattering]
Hey.
What's up?
Hey.
You're Kylie's cousin, right?
Yeah.
Hey.
And I'm Jessica.
I'm her friend.
Jessica.
Okay.
I'm on the show with Kylie.
We just wrapped season two.
"Show"?
What show?
You guys are on a show together or...
You didn't know Kylie stars on a show?
Actually, no, I actually do.
Um...
Th-the... what's it called again?
I think I've seen it before.
It's...
It's called Band Together.
- Just a group of girls.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That show.
For some reason, I thought that... you were talking about something else, so I... yeah.
[chuckles] Is this, like, a... is this, like, a joke?
Are you serious?
Um...
I've just been...
I've been gone for a while, and, uh...
I've actually been out of the country for a long time, and...
I'm just trying to acclimate myself.
A little piece of advice?
You should make sure you're completely acclimated before you start conversations like this.
It's super awkward, and it'll save you a ton of embarrassment.
I'm all right.
[sniffs]
We should get out of here.
I got a couple friends, they're throwing a party.
It'll be fun.
Yeah.
[no audible dialogue]
Come on.
You'll dig this place, I think.
It's on the beach, in Malibu.
Malibu?
Really?
[engine starts]
That's right.
It'll be fun.
Yeah.
I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.
[chattering]
Who are you?
What do you want?
I was looking for someone.
The door was open.
Is everything okay?
My girlfriend's gone missing.
She left.
I...
I don't know.
Do you know where she went?
No.
I don't.
Do you want me to help you find her?
You know where she is.
You know where she is, don't you?
You're home now, Agatha.
You're safe.
Do you have any?
I need it.
I need it.
Do you have any?
Why do you need it so badly?
Why do you need the Guidance?
Guidance is the only thing that makes the pain go away.
It's the only thing that makes me feel.
Agatha, why did you leave the compound?
Please?
Why did you... why did you...
Agatha, look at me.
- Why did you get on that bus?
- Please?
Did Logan... did he say anything to you to influence your decision?
Please?
I'll tell you everything you need to know.
Just help me.
Please?
Please?
Why would you think I know where your girlfriend is?
That's weird.
Why have I never seen you?
Maybe you weren't looking.
They taught you how to do that, didn't they, at the institute?
Taught me what?
What institute?
How to... act normal, fake everything.
You're the Genesis patient.
You never even knew how to be natural.
That was their goal.
You never had limits.
You don't know anything about me.
I know that you were... made... by a committee in a lab.
Where is she?
- Yeah?
- Hey.
Do you want to come out and meet some of my friends?
Just casual.
Um, not really.
Just for a second?
Please?
They think you're hot!
Yeah.
If they only knew...
Yeah.
That's what I said.
Um, let me clean up, okay?
Okay.
So none of you... called the police or anything like that, right?
No.
No, nothing like that.
Not even Ryder?
Ryder isn't like that, Parker.
Why isn't he like that?
Because he's afraid of what you're capable of.
He shouldn't be afraid.
I hate that he's afraid.
I hate it too.
And that's why we need to get him back, right?
Yeah.
We never should've left.
It wasn't your fault.
It wasn't your fault.
It was Logan.
How would I know where your girlfriend is... if I don't even know you?
No, we haven't met, but I know what you...
Fuck!
Fuck!
Hey.
What's up?
Hey.
You're Kylie's cousin, right?
Yeah.
Hey.
And I'm Jessica.
I'm her friend.
Jessica.
Okay.
I'm on the show with Kylie.
We just wrapped season two.
"Show"?
What show?
You guys are on a show together or...
You didn't know Kylie stars on a show?
Actually, no, I actually do.
Um...
Th-the... what's it called again?
I think I've seen it before.
It's...
It's called Band Together.
- Just a group of girls.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That show.
For some reason, I thought that... you were talking about something else, so I... yeah.
Is this, like, a... is this, like, a joke?
Are you serious?
Um...
I've just been...
I've been gone for a while, and, uh...
I've actually been out of the country for a long time, and...
I'm just trying to acclimate myself.

It's on the beach, in Malibu.
Malibu?
Really?
That's right.
It'll be fun.
Yeah.
I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.
Impure.
Who...?
It...
It can't be.
Bular?
I thought you were dead.
I live.
Only to find you've left my father to rot in the Darklands?
You dare to conspire to steal my father's throne?
No, I would never betray...
The Inferna Copula?
You think Angor Rot will bring your reign?
Abandon the ring now, before I feast on your corpse and floss with your intestines.
Bular, please!
Oh, boy.
Oh, you shall beg.
Abandon the ring!
She just walked right...
Pixies.
Angor!
You dare attempt to distort my mind with a pixie?
The nightmare would scare the ring from my hand?
You are a dog and this is your leash!
I am your master.
Obey my command and kill the Trollhunter!
Then you should avoid that school of yours tomorrow.
But the ring will be mine.
Jim Lake asked you to the dance and you didn't tell us?
Spill it, C-bomb, before Mare and I go ka-boom.
There's not much to really tell, except...
I sorta asked him.
Good, girl!
Excuse me, Darci.
Do not celebrate.
Educate.
That's not the way you do things, Claire.
There are rules to being on top of the social food chain.
What sort of world do you think we live in?
If only you knew.
- My goodness, really?
- You don't want to know.
Look at my face and tell me that you do not want to know what happened.
I can't feel my arms.
First day of training can do that, but you are the one that wanted the war hammer.
Hey, hey.
Next time a magic troll assassin pinches your sword, you'll be happy ol' Warhammer and Shadowdancer have your back.
"Shadowdancer"?
Let me guess.
You haven't run that by Claire.
Well, Tobes, rest up.
We can at least feel safe in school knowing Angor Rot won't attack us in broad daylight.
Oh, my gosh, I think I can feel a little baby muscle growing.
Sweet dreams, hunter.
I fear Master Jim is in far more danger than we imagined.
According to the Gloomanac, Angor Rot made a Faustian bargain.
Faustian?
In exchange for his magnificent sorcery, he cursed his soul into a single ring, the Inferna Copula.
Mm, picture.
Helpful.
Whoever bears it, controls him.
Aaarrrgghh, it says here that Angor's been stealing the souls of Trollhunters in a blasphemous attempt to fill the void ever since.
You don't have to hide it from me.
I might only have two eyes, but I can see clear as day.
It's obvious.
Ever since my human deformity, you have been distant.
Uh... yes.
Distant.
I may look different, but I'm still the same Blinky.
How about, to cheer you up, maybe later today,
I could rent a mini-van, we could go for a drive?
Something with tinted windows, of course.
I hear we're not too far away from the world's largest thermometer.
I bet you could eat it!
Mm, not today.
Perhaps another time, my dear friend.
Oh, hey, Steve.
I finished your math homework, and I've already wired lunch money into your account.
Maybe we can skip the locker stuffing today?
- Eli, we've discussed this.
- Ow!
I make the rules.
I'm the alpha.
- Who am I?
- Steve Palchuk.
And there can only be one.
Phase one, find out the name of the cute blonde in biology.
Phase two, ask said cute blonde to Spring Fling.
Phase three make all her dreams come true.
I love you.
- What up, bro?
- Who are you?
Who are you?
Steve Palchuk.
MVP, on the field and off.
- Future king of Arcadia Oaks High.
- No, you can't be Steve.
- I'm Steve.
I'm Steve!
- Ooh!
Ooh-hoo!
You may need to let that one rest.
Dang.
No!
No, no, no!
What up, Steve?
High-five.
So, what are you benching, like, uh...?
What are you looking at?
I'm Steve.
You're not Steve!
I'm Steve!
I'm Steve!
I'm Steve!
- What was that all about?
- SAT season.
I'll tell you, one kid snaps like a snow pea every spring.
So... "Shadowdancer"?
- Well...
- Don't you think I should be...
I don't know... coming up with my own name?
Sorry, too much?
Hardly.
How about "Queen Death Viper 5000 of the Shadow Realm"?
Yeah!
That's more like it.
The Puente de San Marti­n Bridge crosses the...
Sorry, I was, um...
As I was saying... crossing the Tagus River.
The bridge is considered a masterpiece of Spanish architecture.
After the Killahead Bridge was destroyed...
- Wait, Killahead?
- ... in the Battle of Tagus River, the question then became...
"Why wasn't Claire paying better attention to her baby brother?"
Why, Claire?
Why would you let them take him?
It's all your fault!
En...?
Enrique?
Enrique!
Stop!
Your fears are true.
You've been nicked by Creeper's Sun poison and you're turning to stone.
You have medicine?
To slow it, yes.
To cure it... regrettably, no.
Sooner or later, the poison will overtake you.
Mmm...
How long?
Weeks.
With treatment, a few months.
You need to tell your friends.
- No.
- No?
Don't want Toby to know.
I understand.
Then this will be our secret.
What do you mean the dino-park is offline?
- This is bad.
- Definitely not SATs.
- There!
There are shadows!
- My teeth are all gone!
There's monsters in our town!
Why won't anyone believe me?
No!
Who took my clothes?
- It's like we're invisible, dude.
- No, we're not invisible.
They're sleepwalking, like a night terror but in the day.
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.
Who do you think did this?
I don't know, but I bet you Strickler is involved.
Come on.
No running!
No screaming!
No acting weird.
What's happened to you all?
Oh!
What do you mean, it's opening night?
Why is the spotlight on me?
Line?
Line!
No surprise he's gone.
This is supposed to be our safe place, Jim!
What's happening?
Why is everyone crazy-town banana-pants?
I don't know, but I don't like it either.
I need time to think.
We may be down a Shadowdancer, but Warhammer ain't leaving your side, bud.
Tobes, don't move.
There's something glowing on you.
Stay very, very still.
- It's in my nose!
It's in my nose!
- Blow your nose!
Hurry, hurry!
Oh, my gosh, it's inside of me!
Oh, no!
This is what's happening to everybody else!
We don't know that.
Toby, don't freak out.
- You need to study me.
- What are you talking about?
Like in the movies.
I'm that guy.
I'm the test subject you gotta study to learn how to fight the stupid alien creatures.
Whatever happens next, you have to pay close attention...
- attention... attention...
- What?
Are you insane?
Strange sensations, heart rate rising.
My mind is...
Toby!
Tobes!
It's you!
Hey, you, mole.
Will you be my date to Spring Fling?
I love you,
Toby-pie...
Get away from me, Nana!
- And there goes Warhammer.
- Get away from me, Nana!
Thank you so much for coming over, Mr. Blinky.
Well, to be frank, I'm concerned about Jim's progress.
- Ugh!
- Oh!
- Would you like some cream for that?
- Oh, yes, please.
The whipped kind.
Okay.
As for your concern about Jim, he's had his final growth spurt, but his voice should be changing soon.
Ah, thank you!
I meant his odd behavior.
Not his voice.
But, you know, the late nights, the lying.
Jim has a solid head on his shoulders.
And now that we've blasted through his emotional roadblocks, you shouldn't witness any more unusual outbursts from your son.
Hello?
Blinky, everyone's going crazy-town banana-pants!
Uh...
Oh, good, good.
Good afternoon, Mr. President Eisenhower.
I suppose I could pencil you in.
Help!
I've got flying glow-balls making everyone crazy.
It's like they're all trapped in a dream and can't wake up.
No, no, no!
No more mole madness!
It sounds like an infestation of the genus Manicus-Delusious.
Blinky, I only have time for the cheat sheet, not the textbook.
- Pixies.
- Get away from me, Nana!
Pixies?
That's it?
A powerful hallucinogen commonly used as a diversion to cloud the minds of an enemy.
- Diversion?
- Angor Rot is in the school!
I'm going for it!
I'm going for it!
I am Steve.
This is awesome.
Steve is special.
Steve is... special.
- One thousand pirouettes...
- Stop looking at me!
- Stop looking!
- One thousand and two pirouettes.
I'm barn dooring!
I'm...
Do not fret, Master Jim!
I am on the way!
Darn this flesh-vessel!
Glory!
Now to ignite the accelerator.
Car, activate.
Go!
Please?
I'm coming, Master Jim!
For the glory of Merlin...
Hmm...
- Daylight is...
- Daylight is mine to command.
You've kept your wits, hunter.
Let's see if you can keep your head.
Okay, then.
Plan B.
I'm Steve!
I'm Steve!
I'm special!
Great.
Don't kill myself.
Don't kill myself.
I'm special.
Come on!
How do these things work?
Even with your new toys, you're no match for me.
Maybe I'm not, but they are!
Enrique!
Wait!
Stop!
Enrique!
I'm here, I'm here!
Give Nana some smooches!
Or else!
Oof!
Give Nana some smooches!
Give Nana some smooches!
The test subject has found the cure!
Jim!
Jim!
Claire!
I found the cure!
Toby!
Oh, no.
No!
Get a grip.
This is a nightmare.
Wake up, Jim!
This isn't real!
Enrique!
Wait!
No!
I can't!
Enrique!
- Claire!
- Stop!
Enrique!
No!
I can't!
I'm sorry.
A gentleman never strikes a lady, but I'm no gentleman.
- Just do it, Toby.
Just do it!
- No, wait.
Wait up, Enrique.
I'm not Enrique, Claire!
I'm Toby!
Enrique, when did you learn how to talk?
- Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
- Wait, Enrique.
Wait, no.
Wait up, wait up.
- Hey!
- Uh...
Toby, what the heck is going on?
No time!
Now, stick these up your nose and let's go protect Jim.
There!
There's Jim!
May today be an example, hunter.
Nowhere is safe for you.
You are never beyond my reach.
Even right here, protected by peers, nothing can stop me from getting to you.
Then what are you waiting for?
You know nothing of waiting.
I've waited centuries to reclaim what is mine... what I lost.
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to get my ring.
We share a common enemy.
Strickler?
He wears the Inferna Copula.
You will steal it for me.
You want my help?
In return, I shall help you by severing the connection between your mother and Strickler.
We will both be free.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because you have no other choice.
The next time our paths cross, hunter, it will either be the end of Strickler or you.
Romeo, don't leave me.
You can't.
I can't feel them.
Uh...
- Trolls!
They're everywhere!
- Eli!
Hmm...
- Jim!
- Jim!
You're alive!
Oh, man!
We really thought we lost you.
- What did you see, Darce?
- Don't ask.
Yeah.
Let's never speak of this again.
I came as soon as I got word.
Please tell me no one was hurt.
They're all accounted for.
Looks like some kind of chemical leak in your science lab.
That stuff can make you go pretty loopy.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Very lucky indeed.
Oh!
Oh...
By Deya's grace!
You're alive!
Master Jim, I had to run the entire way, with a lavatory stop or two.
Oh, dear.
Your automobiles are the most obstinate machines.
- How did you survive Angor Rot?
- Long story.
Have you heard of the Inferna Copula?
Indeed, I have.
Mmm...
Enough of this madness!
Impure.
Who...?
It...
It can't be.
Bular?
I thought you were dead.
I live.
Only to find you've left my father to rot in the Darklands?
You dare to conspire to steal my father's throne?

A gentleman never strikes a lady, but I'm no gentleman.
- Just do it, Toby.
Just do it!
- No, wait.
Wait up, Enrique.
I'm not Enrique, Claire!
I'm Toby!
Enrique, when did you learn how to talk?
- Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
- Wait, Enrique.
Wait, no.
Wait up, wait up.
- Hey!
- Uh...
Toby, what the heck is going on?
No time!
Now, stick these up your nose and let's go protect Jim.
There!
There's Jim!
May today be an example, hunter.
Nowhere is safe for you.
You are never beyond my reach.
Even right here, protected by peers, nothing can stop me from getting to you.
Then what are you waiting for?
You know nothing of waiting.
I've waited centuries to reclaim what is mine... what I lost.
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to get my ring.
We share a common enemy.
Strickler?
He wears the Inferna Copula.
You will steal it for me.
You want my help?
In return, I shall help you by severing the connection between your mother and Strickler.
We will both be free.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because you have no other choice.
The next time our paths cross, hunter, it will either be the end of Strickler or you.
Romeo, don't leave me.
You can't.
I can't feel them.
Uh...
- Trolls!
They're everywhere!
- Eli!
Hmm...
- Jim!
- Jim!
You're alive!
Oh, man!
We really thought we lost you.
- What did you see, Darce?
- Don't ask.
Yeah.
Let's never speak of this again.
I came as soon as I got word.
Please tell me no one was hurt.
They're all accounted for.
Looks like some kind of chemical leak in your science lab.
That stuff can make you go pretty loopy.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Very lucky indeed.
Oh!
Oh...
By Deya's grace!
You're alive!
Master Jim, I had to run the entire way, with a lavatory stop or two.
Oh, dear.
Your automobiles are the most obstinate machines.
- How did you survive Angor Rot?
- Long story.
Have you heard of the Inferna Copula?
Indeed, I have.
Mmm...
Enough of this madness!
I, OLGA HEPNAROVA
Get up, gins!
Olga, get up.
I'm not going to tell you twice.
I don't want to go to school.
She took 10 pills of Meprobamat.
She just wanted to taste it, but that's nonsense.
We pumped her stomach.
It should be okay.
Thank you.
To commit suicide you need a strong will, my child.
Something you certainly don't have.
Accept it.
You don't need to be afraid.
Wanna fag?
I don't smoke.
Your mistake.
Ignore me.
I don't want anyone sneeking into my bed.
Why are you here?
What do I know.
For run-aways, I guess.
Olga, why don't you read more cheerful books?
Get lost.
I am alone, that's why I'm writing you.
I haven't spoken to my father since he last beat me in autumn.
Recently, I beat up my sister.
For some petty matter.
Strangely, I don't regret it.
She used to beat me.
The only person to whom I speak a little is my mum.
But we have nothing to talk about.
I can't talk to anybody.
I'm alone everywhere.
People just talk and gather and laugh even at things I don't find funny at all.
They talk just to say something, and believe that's quite fine.
I sit and sometimes I don't say a word all day.
I got used to it.
I treat people with scorn.
They may be offended, but I don't despise them.
I wonder how I will feel about them in the future.
In The Quiet American they say:
wouldn't we do better if we didn't try to understand each other and just accepted that no human will ever understand another human, not even wife and husband, lover and mistress or parents and children?
If there is any freedom, then it is bigger in a man with no links to the others.
To people.
When I'm alone, I'm happy.
People cast me out and now they expect me to come back?
No, I will never do that.
I don't see myself as high as to stand against them.
Only my hatred will be against them.
Hatred that won't hurt anybody, except perhaps me myself.
We disturb you, don't we?
You do.
I try not to worry about loneliness but to be happy with it, despite all the sadness and bitterness.
I'm telling you my thoughts and I'm not sure about them.
Am I so unhappy, or so happy?
I don't know.
But I hope you can understand.
I want to go to Moravia for the holidays, on my bike.
My mother asked me: you want to do it alone?
She has no idea how lonely I am.
She's also surprised that I refuse to attend dance classes.
To learn to use social clichés?
No, thanks.
I can do without people, so I can do without dancing as well.
I really wish I could rise above myself, as you wrote me before.
Thank you.
Olga Hepnarova.
Deming, we haven't bought any gifts for your birthday yet.
What would you like?
To get out of here.
So, bon appétit!
Don't stare.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hello, how much today?
Thanks.
Next!
Your name, dammit!
Hey there.
Mum, please, I need help with the hut.
Yeah.
And some money.
Why don't we go for dinner?
What's your name?
And you?
Olga.
I'll do it.
Give it to me.
The stove won't be enough for the winter anyway.
- I'm not going home.
- Oh please, Olga.
They let me repeat the exams, I'm working as a driver.
You're coming back for the winter.
Nobody's going to tell me what to do!
Especially not you!
Nor my father, or my sister, nobody!
Get out!
- What do you want?
- White wine.
Thanks.
You're completely mad.
Hi, do you want to come up?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Thanks.
This is my girlfriend Jana.
Hi, I'm Jana.
I'm fed up.
Want a coffee?
I'd like a beer.
Is it yours?
Don't be silly, it's Jana's.
Do we have something to drink?
So, what is it?
- 300 grams of salami and wine.
- Pardon?
300 grams of salami and wine.
- What kind?
- white.
White.
It's 9.80 CS K.
Olga, slow down, I'm pregnant.
You're invited for dinner.
Where do you get water?
At the pump.
Lunch is ready.
Hello, Olga.
Olga, you're not used to saying hello?
You get on a bus and don't say hello.
Even though you know the people.
That's just how I am.
Whatever, I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
Frantisek Ruzicka.
Jitka!
Jitka.
I've decided to give you my hut.
You don't want me?
What's wrong?
You're just a whore.
I've got Jana.
And other girls too!
Just like you do...
Sorry.
And this is it!
You say nothing.
You didn't mind before.
I don't like your dress, always wearing trousers.
You don't turn me on.
Boring.
You're greasy and you smell of oil.
I'm a driver.
Don't be afraid.
I don't want to hurt you.
I want to kill myself.
I don't believe you!
- Don't be mad at me.
- It's fine, nothing happened.
I'm sorry.
It's over, alright?
The water pipes burst in our street and in the next one.
Getting to work was a nightmare.
Hepnarova, you're disgusting.
I'm going to stink even tomorrow
We're at a dead end!
We're not in a rush anyway.
If I were your mother I would hang you.
You don't need to bother.
If I wanted I'd do it myself.
Come in.
Considering the complaint and all the circumstances...
I suggest to terminate comrade Hepnarova's work contract.
I suggest to terminate comrade Hepnarova's work contract.
Meanwhile, she should perform only assisting tasks and be checked by the company's doctor.
That's all.
I know I'm a psycho, but an enlightened one.
One day you'll pay for your laughter and my tears.
- Hi, I'm Marika.
- I'm Sandy Winiferová.
Let's go somewhere else.
Good morning, Miss.
Are you angry'?
Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.
Why should I be angry?
I always have this look.
I am Mira.
Don't worry'...
My old man beat me, kicked me, lashed my face with a carpet beater, tortured me, stabbed my mother with a butcher knife...
Such an animal.
My mother died 'amen I was 13.
Then I had a stepmother, if I can call her mother.
She was evil, nasty witch.
She was a Catholic fanatic and an even greater Nazi fanatic.
And this bitch was telling me all day about the German Übermensch.
A freak, total wacko.
All parents should be executed and children put into institutions.
But her brother was an extremely kind and noble man.
You either die or survive, but it was often fucking hard.
I'll bring two more.
Hey man, give me two more.
Drinking like hell, right?
Two beers for me!
Awesome.
Come join us!
It was hard.
I was in jail, even.
I'm a fully-fledged runaway.
They were chasing me all day.
I was in jail too.
Interesting.
I'm so ashamed I was dependent on people.
I'm not anymore.
I don't understand them and they don't understand me.
For example, at work they blamed me without any reason.
That happens a lot, all the time.
I hardly have any feelings for people.
Do you like people at all?
I no longer care about reality.
I view the world differently
And how'?
As inanimate matter.
That's a very abstract idea.
What should I make of it?
It's abstract because it doesn't concern me.
The world has no value.
For you, or for everyone?
I can't speak for everyone.
Who do you speak for?
For Hepnarova.
You said that the world had no value.
Do you value yourself?
It's dangerous to isolate oneself from a society completely.
Especially for you.
For me, it's not dangerous anymore.
For whom then?
The estimate is 17,000 CSK for the hut and the land.
That sounds right.
I need twice as much.
I have a dream, I want to buy my own car.
Here is your sick-leave form.
Mum?
Mum?
Who is my father then?
This spread smells strange.
Alena, close the window!
Hi there!
Miss Hepnarova, I've got new vehicles.
You drive well, so I kept one for you.
You'll take it tomorrow, so come earlier to do the paperwork.
I have been thinking a lot.
It seems I'm a lesbian and I'd like to find a partner.
Could you help me find one?
Unfortunately, that's not possible within our healthcare system.
I've been coming for a month.
When will I go to this Lobec?
You need to be patient.
People normally wait several months for hospitalization.
Fine, so you can't help me.
I've been trying all the time.
There's no short therapy.
Yes?
Look, I know my doctor.
He's a psychologist.
He could help you.
Nothing can help me.
Pull yourself together.
No.
Yes, Olga.
He knows me, he'll help you.
You don't have an appointment today.
I'd like you to check on Olga.
I'm off duty soon.
What do you want?
I want to go to Bohnice Asylum.
I don't feel well, I need to rest.
A psychiatric center is not a place to have a rest, it's a hospital.
Show me your ID.
You don't belong to my district.
If you are tired, take some days off.
If you have other problems, consult the company doctor.
If you have other problems, consult the company doctor.
There you go.
Do we go to work?
Go without me.
You're not at work, Olga?
I'm sick with tonsillitis.
I don't feel well and I can't sleep.
Can't you prescribe me something?
I can.
Dormiphen.
Take only a half, not before driving.
I'll keep it in mind.
Tomorrow I'm going to Most.
I found a landlord who will help me.
Hopefully it'll work out.
But I'll need a lot of money.
We should sell the Trabant.
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
We will go to the DMV, you'll sign it over to me and I'll sell it to a country boy up north.
You gonna drink it?
Dear all, please accept this letter as a factual document.
For 13 years, I was imprisoned within a 'good family'.
Beaten and tortured.
A toy for adults, a victim of children.
I had nicknames:
dragonlady, mummy, fallen angel and sleeping virgin.
My torturers were merciless.
I'm the beast in the flock, the black sheep of my family.
I don't have a friend, I never will.
I fall into despair and the result:
escaping from school, from home, from my life.
The Children's Psychiatric Center showed me how blind and useless psychiatric medicine was.
In 1971, I went to live in our hut 'which was a symbol of my loneliness.
After 18 months, I moved into the company's dormitory, a hostel which was a monstrous Babylon where one can survive with strong will.
I am as impoverished as the worst drug addict.
But where are my drugs?
All my feelings almost exhausted.
All my hope gone.
And the fallen angel is not broken.
Why am I doing it?
To let people realize how a helpless individual can end.
My position is worse than that of a black American.
Why?
Because I'm alone.
I've been lynched a thousand times:
by my father, trapped in a shower and beaten until I was bleeding, countless times I've been told I was a wretch with no place in a society, countless times I've been avoided by people who spit on the ground or on me,
in the public streets of CSSR.
In every job, I'm publicly smeared, vilified, laughed at and humiliated.
Emotional condition:
I'm a sexual cripple.
I'm unable to create and be part of a human relationship.
I'm a wreck.
I'm ruined by people.
Therefore I have a choice: to kill myself, or kill others.
My decision is as follows:
I will get revenge on my haters.
You wouldn't pay the price if I became an anonymous suicide.
And because society is too sovereign to condemn itself, it is often tried privately, sometimes punished, other times just shocked.
This is my verdict:
I, Olga Hepnarova, a victim of your bestiality, sentence you to death by being run over and declare a few lives is too cheap a price for my life.
Acta non verba.
Thank you.
Prague, 1973.
Olga Hepnarova.
For god's sake, what have you done?
Did your brakes fail or what?
Did you fall asleep?
No.
None of this.
I did it on purpose.
What?
Come!
Watch her, I must get back there.
- When will the trial be?
- Soon.
I heard you borrowed the criminal code book.
Yes.
I read your papers.
Do you still insist on being given the death sentence?
But I will be given it.
With my crime, We committed suicide in fact.
Tell me yourself...
What can a second life offer me?
You ask the death sentence because you realized that living with your conscience could be even worse?
That's why you no longer want to live?
If they hang me, my crime will have a higher value.
Value?
As a victim of bullying I was exceptional.
I'm healthy, I have two arms and two legs.
I speak Czech, I have white skin.
I never did anything to anyone.
And still, society treated me in such a brutal way that it can't be matched.
That may be just your feeling.
No.
People simply picked on me.
So when people experience injustice, they should seek revenge?
Why I seek revenge and you don't is clear.
I ran out of superhuman strength.
I'm not God, and yet I punish.
I do so due to my personal right to revenge.
Once you're a poor victim, next time you're God.
So what are you really?
I'm no longer a human being, much less a Christian.
Through my actions, I have crossed the line.
Every improvement has its cost.
Improvement?
Evil can't be rectified with evil.
People have always been evil.
You simply deny that man can choose between good and evil.
You're weak.
But I didn't say anything about a possibility to choose.
People have other possibilities but they always choose evil.
Just as you did.
So you are like the others.
I truly don't know how to defend you.
You want to suffer.
I have only one request.
I have only one request.
Do not plead insanity.
The aggrieved, Vera Mrázková, seeks recompense for a broken watch, 350 CSK.
Ludmila Jedlicková seeks compensation of 63 CSK for 12 kilograms of currants and for her husband's damaged clothing, the value of which she cannot state.
Jiri Hercík's plenipotentiary petitions for 5,700 CSK for extra funeral expenses, 1/3 of costs on clothing and grave maintenance.
Receipts are to be submitted.
Bozena Horálková doesn't seek compensation.
Prague Provisions seeks 2,542.60 CSK for damaged window display.
On 10th July 1973, driving a large van, the accused drove the vehicle onto the pavement, intentionally, and proceeded to drive for 31 metres, crashing, running over and injuring a total of 20 people, killing 8 of them.
On 7th September 1970, at her father's farmstead in Zábrodí she started a fire, intending to ruin this farmstead, and caused damage of 100 CSK.
On these grounds, Olga Hepnarova is accused of the punishable crimes of both first and second degree murder and of attempting to damage the property of others.
Do you want to address the charges?
You see 8 dead bodies, I see 8 dead bodies as well.
Or maybe 8 times 10 dead bodies.
But what kind of people are they?
Are they so-called Prügelknabe?
No.
I am a Prügelknabe.
I want to ask you now not to breed such people.
If you don't breed them they won't think the way I do and they won't do what I did.
Can you tell us what Prügelknabe means in Czech?
Victim of bullying.
Call for closing remarks.
I suggest to find the accused guilty and I suggest an exceptional punishment.
I ask the court not to take into account the psychiatric expert testimony as I consider it to be done in an inappropriate way.
In opposition to the expert's testimony,
I believe Hepnarova to be a schizophrenic and therefore not fully responsible for her actions.
Today's people are not humane.
They didn't behave in a humane way towards me or other Prügelknabe.
I did it out of revengefulness and also to prevent further cases of this kind.
There are more potential killers like me.
But they don't have courage to do it.
I want to draw people's attention to the ones of my kind.
I think you could take certain measures to prevent such cases in the future.
If you don't want to die on the street or elsewhere at the hands of Prügelknabe who will do it by the right of your justice
or by the right of your injustice.
I could kill myself and solve problems resulting from the need to get rid of bullied ones.
I'd like to say that you people indirectly made me do what I did.
You couldn't think I would just kill myself in silence.
As for the future...
I will never repeat such actions.
Finally, I would like to point out I confessed to the crime I committed.
Finally...
I ask that you sentence me to death.
The court will now break so the jury can come to its verdict.
There were no extenuating circumstances in this case.
Due to the facts of the case, the accused has been sentenced to death.
It is possible to appeal against this verdict.
Would the accused like to comment on the verdict?
Due to her mental condition, the accused isn't fully responsible for what she says.
That is my personal opinion.
I would like to thank the court and all people for their future tolerance of themselves and all Prügelknabe.
I'd like to say that I don't want to appeal and I will not appeal.
Come out!
What do you want?
There has been nobody for a year.
I don't care about you.
I didn't do anything and I didn't have any trial.
How does it suit you being in a cell alone?
It suits me well.
I walk and read.
I'm reading Masters of the Secret Service.
Is there anything special going on around or inside you?
Special... nothing.
Except he doesn't want to talk to me.
Who?
Does it upset you?
Why did you smile?
I don't know.
Who should talk to you?
You want to talk to someone?
I talk to him, but seldom.
To Winifer.
The man I signed was my father.
On Victor Hugo street, I signed for Winifer to be my father.
Did you hear his voice?
I say I talk to him.
What is it like when he answers?
He calls me My Child, and I call him Father.
What do you talk about?
He tells me to be calm, that I will be freed.
That I shouldn't worry.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
Do you know your name?
Winiferová.
My father is Oto Winifer.
What does your ID card say?
Hepnarova.
That is how they call me.
Were you raised by the Hepnars?
Yes.
Is your mother real, at least?
Who knows, officially...
My real father is in the Vatican.
At the CRV:
Contra Regional Vatican.
It is the Vatican secret police.
Counterintelligence.
Why didn't you tell us Hepnar wasn't your father?
I didn't know.
I can't tell you if I don't know.
How often do you talk?
Twice a week.
Do you answer him?
Yes.
Aloud?
I have to whisper so they can't hear us.
Sometimes he sings to me so I'm not sad.
You are sad?
I am.
Why?
I don't know.
I feel remorse...
I feel remorse for them, truly, but...
I had to find some reason when I said I didn't feel remorse.
I couldn't say anything before, it was part of the game.
- You know the purpose of the game?
- I do, but not everything.
I only knew what I had to do...
Confess.
To a crime you didn't commit?
What do you mean, "didn't"?
I did commit it.
I'm Winiferová.
Who committed the crime, Winiferová or Hepnarova?
Hepnarova.
But I'm the one you punished.
- Hepnarova once said...
- Don't tell me that!
I didn't say I'd do it again.
I intended to say Hepnarova wanted to be hung to let people know about her case.
What can you say about that?
I wouldn't die anyway, even if I were hung.
Winifer would save me.
I, OLGA HEPNAROVÁ
Get up, girls!
Olga, get up.
I'm not going to tell you twice.
I don't want to go to school.
She took 10 pills of Meprobamate.
She just wanted to taste it, but that's nonsense.
We pumped her stomach.
It should be okay.
Thank you.
To commit suicide you need a strong will, my child.
Something you certainly don't have.
Accept it.
You don't need to be afraid.
Wanna fag?
I don't smoke.
Your mistake.
Ignore me.
I don't want anyone sneeking into my bed.
Why are you here?
What do I know.
For run-aways, I guess.
Olga, why don't you read more cheerful books?
Get lost.
I am alone, that's why I'm writing you.
I haven't spoken to my father since he last beat me in autumn.

If there is any freedom, then it is bigger in a man with no links to the others.
To people.
When I'm alone, I'm happy.
People cast me out and now they expect me to come back?
No, I will never do that.
I don't see myself as high as to stand against them.
Only my hatred will be against them.
Hatred that won't hurt anybody, except perhaps me myself.
We disturb you, don't we?
You do.
I try not to worry about loneliness but to be happy with it, despite all the sadness and bitterness.
I'm telling you my thoughts and I'm not sure about them.
Am I so unhappy, or so happy?
I don't know.
But I hope you can understand.
I want to go to Moravia for the holidays, on my bike.
My mother asked me:

Thanks.
Thank you.
Hello, how much today?
Thanks.
Next!
Your name, dammit!
Hey there.
Mum, please, I need help with the hut.
Yeah.
And some money.
Why don't we go for dinner?
What's your name?
And you?
Olga.
I'll do it.
Give it to me.
The stove won't be enough for the winter anyway.
- I'm not going home.
- Oh please, Olga.
They let me repeat the exams, I'm working as a driver.
You're coming back for the winter.
Nobody's going to tell me what to do!
Especially not you!
Nor my father, or my sister, nobody!
Get out!
- What do you want?
- White wine.
Thanks.
You're completely mad.
Hi, do you want to come up?

- Hi.
Thanks.
This is my girlfriend Jana.
Hi, I'm Jana.
I'm fed up.
Want a coffee?
I'd like a beer.
Is it yours?
Don't be silly, it's Jana's.
Do we have something to drink?
So, what is it?
- 300 grams of salami and wine.
- Pardon?
300 grams of salami and wine.
- What kind?
- White.
It's 9.80 CSK.
Olga, slow down, I'm pregnant.
You're invited for dinner.
Where do you get water?
At the pump.
Lunch is ready.
Hello, Olga.
Olga, you're not used to saying hello?
You get on a bus and don't say hello.

That's just how I am.
Whatever, I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
František Ružicka.
Jitka!
Jitka.
I've decided to give you my hut.
You don't want me?
What's wrong?
You're just a whore.
I've got Jana.
And other girls too!
Just like you do...
Sorry.
And this is it!
You say nothing.
You didn't mind before.
I don't like your dress, always wearing trousers.

Boring.
You're greasy and you smell of oil.
I'm a driver.
Don't be afraid.
I don't want to hurt you.
I want to kill myself.
I don't believe you!
- Don't be mad at me.
- It's fine, nothing happened.
I'm sorry.
It's over, alright?
The water pipes burst in our street and in the next one.
Getting to work was a nightmare.
Hepnarova, you're disgusting.
I'm going to stink even tomorrow.
We're at a dead end!
We're not in a rush anyway.
If I were your mother I would hang you.
You don't need to bother.
If I wanted I'd do it myself.
Come in.
Considering the complaint and all the circumstances...
I suggest to terminate comrade
Hepnarová's work contract.
Meanwhile, she should perform only assisting tasks and be checked by the company's doctor.
That's all.
I know I'm a psycho, but an enlightened one.
One day you'll pay for your laughter and my tears.
- Hi, I'm Marika.
- I'm Sandy Winiferová.
Let's go somewhere else.
Good morning, Miss.
Are you angry?
Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.
Why should I be angry?
I always have this look.
I am Mira.
Don't worry...
My old man beat me, kicked me, lashed my face with a carpet beater, tortured me, stabbed my mother with a butcher knife...
Such an animal.
My mother died when I was 13.
Then I had a stepmother, if I can call her mother.
She was evil, nasty witch.
She was a Catholic fanatic and an even greater Nazi fanatic.
And this bitch was telling me all day about the German Übermensch.
A freak, total wacko.
All parents should be executed and children put into institutions.
But her brother was an extremely kind and noble man.
You either die or survive, but it was often fucking hard.
I'll bring two more.
Hey man, give me two more.
Drinking like hell, right?
Two beers for me!
Awesome.
Come join us!
It was hard.
I was in jail, even.
I'm a fully-fledged runaway.
They were chasing me all day.
I was in jail too.
Interesting.
I'm so ashamed I was dependent on people.
I'm not anymore.
I don't understand them and they don't understand me.
For example, at work they blamed me without any reason.
That happens a lot, all the time.
I hardly have any feelings for people.
Do you like people at all?
I no longer care about reality.
I view the world differently.
And how?
As inanimate matter.
That's a very abstract idea.
What should I make of it?
It's abstract because it doesn't concern me.
The world has no value.
For you, or for everyone?
I can't speak for everyone.
Who do you speak for?
For Hepnarová.
You said that the world had no value.
Do you value yourself?
It's dangerous to isolate oneself from a society completely.
Especially for you.
For me, it's not dangerous anymore.
For whom then?
The estimate is 17,000 CSK for the hut and the land.
That sounds right.
I need twice as much.
I have a dream, I want to buy my own car.
Here is your sick-leave form.
Mum?
Who is my father then?
This spread smells strange.
Alena, close the window!
Hi there!
Miss Hepnarová, I've got new vehicles.
You drive well, so I kept one for you.
You'll take it tomorrow, so come earlier to do the paperwork.
I have been thinking a lot.
It seems I'm a lesbian and I'd like to find a partner.
Could you help me find one?
Unfortunately, that's not possible within our healthcare system.
I've been coming for a month.
When will I go to this Lobec?
You need to be patient.
People normally wait several months for hospitalization.
Fine, so you can't help me.
I've been trying all the time.
There's no short therapy.
Yes?
Look, I know my doctor.
He's a psychologist.
He could help you.
Nothing can help me.
Pull yourself together.
No.
Yes, Olga.
He knows me, he'll help you.
You don't have an appointment today.
I'd like you to check on Olga.
I'm off duty soon.
What do you want?
I want to go to Bohnice Asylum.
I don't feel well, I need to rest.
A psychiatric center is not a place to have a rest, it's a hospital.
Show me your ID.
You don't belong to my district.
If you are tired, take some days off.
If you have other problems, consult the company doctor.
There you go.
Do we go to work?
Go without me.
You're not at work, Olga?
I'm sick with tonsillitis.
I don't feel well and I can't sleep.
Can't you prescribe me something?
I can.
Dormiphen.
Take only a half, not before driving.
I'll keep it in mind.
Tomorrow I'm going to Most.
I found a landlord who will help me.
Hopefully it'll work out.
But I'll need a lot of money.
We should sell the Trabant.
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
We will go to the DMV, you'll sign it over to me and I'll sell it to a country boy up north.
You gonna drink it?
Dear all, please accept this letter as a factual document.
For 13 years, I was imprisoned within a 'good family'.
Beaten and tortured.
A toy for adults, a victim of children.
I had nicknames:
dragonlady, mummy, fallen angel and sleeping virgin.
My torturers were merciless.
I'm the beast in the flock, the black sheep of my family.
I don't have a friend, I never will.
I fall into despair and the result:
escaping from school, from home, from my life.
The Children's Psychiatric Center showed me how blind and useless psychiatric medicine was.
In 1971, I went to live in our hut which was a symbol of my loneliness.
After 18 months, I moved into the company's dormitory, a hostel which was a monstrous Babylon where one can survive with strong will.
I am as impoverished as the worst drug addict.
But where are my drugs?
All my feelings almost exhausted.
All my hope gone.
And the fallen angel is not broken.
Why am I doing it?
To let people realize how a helpless individual can end.
My position is worse than that of a black American.
Why?
Because I'm alone.
I've been lynched a thousand times:
by my father, trapped in a shower and beaten until I was bleeding, countless times I've been told I was a wretch with no place in a society, countless times I've been avoided by people who spit on the ground or on me,
in the public streets of CSSR.
In every job, I'm publicly smeared, vilified, laughed at and humiliated.
Emotional condition:
I'm a sexual cripple.
I'm unable to create and be part of a human relationship.
I'm a wreck.
I'm ruined by people.
Therefore I have a choice:
to kill myself, or kill others.
My decision is as follows:
I will get revenge on my haters.
You wouldn't pay the price if I became an anonymous suicide.
And because society is too sovereign to condemn itself, it is often tried privately, sometimes punished, other times just shocked.
This is my verdict:
I, Olga Hepnarova, a victim of your bestiality, sentence you to death by being run over and declare a few lives is too cheap a price for my life.
Acta non verba.
Thank you.
Prague, 1973.
Olga Hepnarová.
For god's sake, what have you done?
Did your brakes fail or what?
Did you fall asleep?
No.
None of this.
I did it on purpose.
What?
Come!
Watch her, I must get back there.
- When will the trial be?
- Soon.
I heard you borrowed the criminal code book.
Yes.
I read your papers.
Do you still insist on being given the death sentence?
But I will be given it.
With my crime, We committed suicide in fact.
Tell me yourself...
What can a second life offer me?
You ask the death sentence because you realized that living with your conscience could be even worse?
That's why you no longer want to live?
If they hang me, my crime will have a higher value.
Value?
As a victim of bullying I was exceptional.
I'm healthy, I have two arms and two legs.
I speak Czech, I have white skin.
I never did anything to anyone.
And still, society treated me in such a brutal way that it can't be matched.
That may be just your feeling.
No.
People simply picked on me.
So when people experience injustice, they should seek revenge?
Why I seek revenge and you don't is clear.
I ran out of superhuman strength.
I'm not God, and yet I punish.
I do so due to my personal right to revenge.
Once you're a poor victim, next time you're God.
So what are you really?
I'm no longer a human being, much less a Christian.
Through my actions, I have crossed the line.
Every improvement has its cost.
Improvement?
Evil can't be rectified with evil.
People have always been evil.
You simply deny that man can choose between good and evil.
You're weak.
But I didn't say anything about a possibility to choose.
People have other possibilities but they always choose evil.
Just as you did.
So you are like the others.
I truly don't know how to defend you.
You want to suffer.
I have only one request.
Do not plead insanity.
The aggrieved, Vera Mrázková, seeks recompense for a broken watch, 350 CSK.
Ludmila Jedlicková seeks compensation of 63 CSK for 12 kilograms of currants and for her husband's damaged clothing, the value of which she cannot state.
Jiri Hercík's plenipotentiary petitions for 5,700 CSK for extra funeral expenses,
1/3 of costs on clothing and grave maintenance.
Receipts are to be submitted.
Božena Horálková doesn't seek compensation.
Prague Provisions seeks 2,542.60 CSK for damaged window display.
On 10th July 1973, driving a large van, the accused drove the vehicle onto the pavement, intentionally, and proceeded to drive for 31 metres, crashing, running over and injuring a total of 20 people, killing 8 of them.
On 7th September 1970, at her father's farmstead in Zábrodí she started a fire, intending to ruin this farmstead, and caused damage of 100 CSK.
On these grounds, Olga Hepnarová is accused of the punishable crimes of both first and second degree murder and of attempting to damage the property of others.
Do you want to address the charges?
You see 8 dead bodies, I see 8 dead bodies as well.
Or maybe 8 times 10 dead bodies.
But what kind of people are they?
Are they so-called Prügelknabe?
No.
I am a Prügelknabe.
I want to ask you now not to breed such people.
If you don't breed them they won't think the way I do and they won't do what I did.
Can you tell us what Prügelknabe means in Czech?
Victim of bullying.
Call for closing remarks.
I suggest to find the accused guilty and I suggest an exceptional punishment.
I ask the court not to take into account the psychiatric expert testimony as I consider it to be done in an inappropriate way.
In opposition to the expert's testimony,
I believe Hepnarová to be a schizophrenic and therefore not fully responsible for her actions.
Today's people are not humane.
They didn't behave in a humane way towards me or other Prügelknabe.
I did it out of revengefulness and also to prevent further cases of this kind.
There are more potential killers like me.
But they don't have courage to do it.
I want to draw people's attention to the ones of my kind.
I think you could take certain measures to prevent such cases in the future.
If you don't want to die on the street or elsewhere at the hands of Prügelknabe who will do it by the right of your justice
or by the right of your injustice.
I could kill myself and solve problems resulting from the need to get rid of bullied ones.
I'd like to say that you people indirectly made me do what I did.
You couldn't think I would just kill myself in silence.
As for the future...
I will never repeat such actions.
Finally, I would like to point out I confessed to the crime I committed.
Finally...
I ask that you sentence me to death.
The court will now break so the jury can come to its verdict.
There were no extenuating circumstances in this case.
Due to the facts of the case, the accused has been sentenced to death.
It is possible to appeal against this verdict.
Would the accused like to comment on the verdict?
Due to her mental condition, the accused isn't fully responsible for what she says.
That is my personal opinion.
I would like to thank the court and all people for their future tolerance of themselves and all Prügelknabe.
I'd like to say that I don't want to appeal and I will not appeal.
Come out!
What do you want?
There has been nobody for a year.
I don't care about you.
I didn't do anything and I didn't have any trial.
How does it suit you being in a cell alone?
It suits me well.
I walk and read.
I'm reading Masters of the Secret Service.
Is there anything special going on around or inside you?
Special... nothing.
Except he doesn't want to talk to me.
Who?
Does it upset you?
Why did you smile?
I don't know.
Who should talk to you?
You want to talk to someone?
I talk to him, but seldom.
To Winifer.
The man I signed was my father.
On Victor Hugo street, I signed for Winifer to be my father.
Did you hear his voice?
I say I talk to him.
What is it like when he answers?
He calls me My Child, and I call him Father.
What do you talk about?
He tells me to be calm, that I will be freed.
That I shouldn't worry.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
Do you know your name?
Winiferová.
My father is Oto Winifer.
What does your ID card say?
Hepnarová.
That is how they call me.
Were you raised by the Hepnars?
Yes.
Is your mother real, at least?
Who knows, officially...
My real father is in the Vatican.
At the CRV:
Contra Regional Vatican.
It is the Vatican secret police.
Counterintelligence.
Why didn't you tell us Hepnar wasn't your father?
I didn't know.
I can't tell you if I don't know.
How often do you talk?
Twice a week.
Do you answer him?
Yes.
Aloud?
I have to whisper so they can't hear us.
Sometimes he sings to me so I'm not sad.
You are sad?
I am.
Why?
I don't know.
I feel remorse...
I feel remorse for them, truly, but...
I had to find some reason when I said I didn't feel remorse.
I couldn't say anything before, it was part of the game.
- You know the purpose of the game?
- I do, but not everything.
I only knew what I had to do...
Confess.
To a crime you didn't commit?
What do you mean, "didn't"?
I did commit it.
I'm Winiferová.
Who committed the crime, Winiferová or Hepnarova?
Hepnarova.
But I'm the one you punished.
- Hepnarova once said...
- Don't tell me that!
I didn't say I'd do it again.
I intended to say Hepnarova wanted to be hung to let people know about her case.
What can you say about that?
I wouldn't die anyway, even if I were hung.
Winifer would save me.
I, OLGA HEPNAROVA
Get up, girls!
Olga, get up.
I'm not going to tell you twice.
I don't want to go to school.
She took 10 pills of Meprobamat.
She just wanted to taste it, but that's nonsense.
We pumped her stomach.
It should be okay.
Thank you.
To commit suicide you need a strong will, my child.
Something you certainly don't have.
Accept it.
You don't need to be afraid.
Wanna fag?
I don't smoke.
Your mistake.
Ignore me.
I don't want anyone sneeking into my bed.
Why are you here?
What do I know.
For run-aways, I guess.
Olga, why don't you read more cheerful books?
Get lost.
I am alone, that's why I'm writing you.
I haven't spoken to my father since he last beat me in autumn.
Recently, I beat up my sister.
For some petty matter.
Strangely, I don't regret it.
She used to beat me.
The only person to whom I speak a little is my mum.
But we have nothing to talk about.
I can't talk to anybody.
I'm alone everywhere.
People just talk and gather and laugh even at things I don't find funny at all.
They talk just to say something, and believe that's quite fine.
I sit and sometimes I don't say a word all day.
I got used to it.
I treat people with scorn.
They may be offended, but I don't despise them.
I wonder how I will feel about them in the future.
In The Quiet American they say:
wouldn't we do better if we didn't try to understand each other and just accepted that no human will ever understand another human, not even wife and husband, lover and mistress or parents and children?
If there is any freedom, then it is bigger in a man with no links to the others.
To people.
When I'm alone, I'm happy.
People cast me out and now they expect me to come back?
No, I will never do that.
I don't see myself as high as to stand against them.
Only my hatred will be against them.
Hatred that won't hurt anybody, except perhaps me myself.
We disturb you, don't we?
You do.
I try not to worry about loneliness but to be happy with it, despite all the sadness and bitterness.
I'm telling you my thoughts and I'm not sure about them.
Am I so unhappy, or so happy?
I don't know.
But I hope you can understand.
I want to go to Moravia for the holidays, on my bike.
My mother asked me: you want to do it alone?
She has no idea how lonely I am.
She's also surprised that I refuse to attend dance classes.
To learn to use social clichés?
No, thanks.
I can do without people, so I can do without dancing as well.
I really wish I could rise above myself, as you wrote me before.
Thank you.
Olga Hepnarova.
Deming, we haven't bought any gifts for your birthday yet.
What would you like?
To get out of here.
So, bon appétit!
Don't stare.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hello, how much today?
Thanks.
Next!
Your name, dammit!
Hey there.
Mum, please, I need help with the hut.
Yeah.
And some money.
Why don't we go for dinner?
What's your name?
And you?
Olga.
I'll do it.
Give it to me.
The stove won't be enough for the winter anyway.
- I'm not going home.
- Oh please, Olga.
They let me repeat the exams, I'm working as a driver.
You're coming back for the winter.
Nobody's going to tell me what to do!
Especially not you!
Nor my father, or my sister, nobody!
Get out!
- What do you want?
- White wine.
Thanks.
You're completely mad.
Hi, do you want to come up?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Thanks.
This is my girlfriend Jana.
Hi, I'm Jana.
I'm fed up.
Want a coffee?
I'd like a beer.
Is it yours?
Don't be silly, it's Jana's.
Do we have something to drink?
So, what is it?
- 300 grams of salami and wine.
- Pardon?
300 grams of salami and wine.
- What kind?
- White.
It's 9.80 CS K.
Olga, slow down, I'm pregnant.
You're invited for dinner.
Where do you get water?
At the pump.
Lunch is ready.
Hello, Olga.
Olga, you're not used to saying hello?
You get on a bus and don't say hello.
Even though you know the people.
That's just how I am.
Whatever, I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
Frantisek Ruzicka.
Jitka!
Jitka.
I've decided to give you my hut.
You don't want me?
What's wrong?
You're just a whore.
I've got Jana.
And other girls too!
Just like you do...
Sorry.
And this is it!
You say nothing.
You didn't mind before.
I don't like your dress, always wearing trousers.
You don't turn me on.
Boring.
You're greasy and you smell of oil.
I'm a driver.
Don't be afraid.
I don't want to hurt you.
I want to kill myself.
I don't believe you!
- Don't be mad at me.
- It's fine, nothing happened.
I'm sorry.
It's over, alright?
The water pipes burst in our street and in the next one.
Getting to work was a nightmare.
Hepnarova, you're disgusting.
I'm going to stink even tomorrow
We're at a dead end!
We're not in a rush anyway.
If I were your mother I would hang you.
You don't need to bother.
If I wanted I'd do it myself.
Come in.
Considering the complaint and all the circumstances...
I suggest to terminate comrade Hepnarova's work contract.

I truly don't know how to defend you.
You want to suffer.
I have only one request.
Do not plead insanity.
The aggrieved, Vera Mrázková, seeks recompense for a broken watch, 350 CSK.
Ludmila Jedlicková seeks compensation of 63 CSK for 12 kilograms of currants and for her husband's damaged clothing, the value of which she cannot state.
Jiri Hercík's plenipotentiary petitions for 5,700 CSK for extra funeral expenses, 1/3 of costs on clothing and grave maintenance.
Receipts are to be submitted.
Bozena Horálková doesn't seek compensation.
Prague Provisions seeks 2,542.60 CSK for damaged window display.
On 10th July 1973, driving a large van, the accused drove the vehicle onto the pavement, intentionally, and proceeded to drive for 31 metres, crashing, running over and injuring a total of 20 people, killing 8 of them.
On 7th September 1970, at her father's farmstead in Zábrodí she started a fire, intending to ruin this farmstead, and caused damage of 100 CSK.
On these grounds, Olga Hepnarova is accused of the punishable crimes of both first and second degree murder and of attempting to damage the property of others.
Do you want to address the charges?
You see 8 dead bodies, I see 8 dead bodies as well.
Or maybe 8 times 10 dead bodies.
But what kind of people are they?
Are they so-called Prügelknabe?
No.
I am a Prügelknabe.
I want to ask you now not to breed such people.
If you don't breed them they won't think the way I do and they won't do what I did.
Can you tell us what Prügelknabe means in Czech?
Victim of bullying.
Call for closing remarks.
I suggest to find the accused guilty and I suggest an exceptional punishment.
I ask the court not to take into account the psychiatric expert testimony as I consider it to be done in an inappropriate way.
In opposition to the expert's testimony,
I believe Hepnarova to be a schizophrenic and therefore not fully responsible for her actions.
Today's people are not humane.
They didn't behave in a humane way towards me or other Prügelknabe.
I did it out of revengefulness and also to prevent further cases of this kind.
There are more potential killers like me.
But they don't have courage to do it.
I want to draw people's attention to the ones of my kind.
I think you could take certain measures to prevent such cases in the future.
If you don't want to die on the street or elsewhere at the hands of Prügelknabe who will do it by the right of your justice
or by the right of your injustice.
I could kill myself and solve problems resulting from the need to get rid of bullied ones.
I'd like to say that you people indirectly made me do what I did.
You couldn't think I would just kill myself in silence.
As for the future...
I will never repeat such actions.
Finally, I would like to point out I confessed to the crime I committed.
Finally...
I ask that you sentence me to death.
The court will now break so the jury can come to its verdict.
There were no extenuating circumstances in this case.
Due to the facts of the case, the accused has been sentenced to death.
It is possible to appeal against this verdict.
Would the accused like to comment on the verdict?
Due to her mental condition, the accused isn't fully responsible for what she says.
That is my personal opinion.
I would like to thank the court and all people for their future tolerance of themselves and all Prügelknabe.
I'd like to say that I don't want to appeal and I will not appeal.
Come out!
What do you want?
There has been nobody for a year.
I don't care about you.
I didn't do anything and I didn't have any trial.
How does it suit you being in a cell alone?
It suits me well.
I walk and read.
I'm reading Masters of the Secret Service.
Is there anything special going on around or inside you?
Special... nothing.
Except he doesn't want to talk to me.
Who?
Does it upset you?
Why did you smile?
I don't know.
Who should talk to you?
You want to talk to someone?
I talk to him, but seldom.
To Winifer.
The man I signed was my father.
On Victor Hugo street, I signed for Winifer to be my father.
Did you hear his voice?
I say I talk to him.
What is it like when he answers?
He calls me My Child, and I call him Father.
What do you talk about?
He tells me to be calm, that I will be freed.
That I shouldn't worry.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
Do you know your name?
Winiferová.
My father is Oto Winifer.
What does your ID card say?
Hepnarova.
That is how they call me.
Were you raised by the Hepnars?
Yes.
Is your mother real, at least?
Who knows, officially...
My real father is in the Vatican.
At the CRV:
Contra Regional Vatican.
It is the Vatican secret police.
Counterintelligence.
Why didn't you tell us Hepnar wasn't your father?
I didn't know.
I can't tell you if I don't know.
How often do you talk?
Twice a week.
Do you answer him?
Yes.
Aloud?
I have to whisper so they can't hear us.
Sometimes he sings to me so I'm not sad.
You are sad?
I am.
Why?
I don't know.
I feel remorse...
I feel remorse for them, truly, but...
I had to find some reason when I said I didn't feel remorse.
I couldn't say anything before, it was part of the game.
- You know the purpose of the game?
- I do, but not everything.
I only knew what I had to do...
Confess.
To a crime you didn't commit?
What do you mean, "didn't"?
I did commit it.
I'm Winiferová.
Who committed the crime, Winiferová or Hepnarova?
Hepnarova.
But I'm the one you punished.
- Hepnarova once said...
- Don't tell me that!
I didn't say I'd do it again.
I intended to say Hepnarova wanted to be hung to let people know about her case.
What can you say about that?
I wouldn't die anyway, even if I were hung.
Winifer would save me.

This week on "VICE":
Forced labor in Dubai.
(man speaking foreign language)
The Trump International Golf Club, is that where you worked recently?
And then, the impact of China's massive investment in Africa.
And what did you think when you first moved here?
Very free country.

Don't shoot!
Hands up!
"VICE" correspondent Ben Anderson first reported on slave labor in the United Arab Emirates eight years ago.
We're going to see what conditions are like on this, which is one of the most high profile projects in the whole of Dubai.
During a recent investigation, he discovered some of the worst conditions he'd ever seen on a development bearing the name of a man who just might be our next president.
♪ ♪
Anderson:
The United Arab Emirates, and Dubai in particular, are often sold as a paradise in the Middle East.
Home to the world's largest and most luxurious malls, hotels and golf courses, promising unprecedented luxury for the few who can afford it.
So this is Sheikh Zayed Road, one of the most famous landmarks in Dubai.
Billions and billions of dollars of real estate, and then literally in the shadows of that is this slum.
So the hundreds of thousands of men who actually built Dubai, this is where they live.
The UAE's record on migrant worker's rights is well known, so we started our investigation by looking at NYU.
When they were enticed into Abu Dhabi, they established their own labor standards so that subcontractors building their campus would treat their workers fairly.
Those standards were tested when one group of workers went on strike.
They live two hours drive away from the campus site in Dubai.
So this is one of the many labor camps in Dubai, and there are just dozens of huge buildings that look like a cross between warehouses and prisons.
This is the Dubai that most tourists who come never see.
Striking is strictly illegal in the UAE, but these workers eventually felt like they had no other option.
(speaking foreign language)
So can you describe how the company reacted when you went on strike?
Anderson:
Most workers have to take out loans to get to the UAE.
Being deported means going home saddled with debt, and no way of paying it off.
The strike was covered by "The New York Times,"
a week before a lavish commencement ceremony featuring former President Bill Clinton, who was forced to address the issue.
When this story came out, the university and the government promised to look into the charges, and if the charges were well founded, to take appropriate remedial action promptly.
Anderson:
What the government actually did was call the journalist who broke the story in for questioning.
Well, I was told to meet the spokesperson for Abu Dhabi police in a bar.
You recorded this meeting?
(man speaking)
Anderson:
After letting him know he was in trouble, they offered a way out.
As you can see here in the transcript, the police chief wanted a monthly report.
Any foreign journalists who were coming to the UAE,
I was to write a report on why they're in the UAE, what their agenda was...
You'd be spying on foreign journalists as well, for them?
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.
What happened?
You said to them you're not accepting the offer?
I said, "Yeah, yeah." I listened to it and everything, and then I left the country pretty soon after that.
And then when I came back, I was arrested at the airport, and then I was deported.
Anderson:
After commissioning an independent report,
NYU admitted real lapses and promised to pay compensation to 10,000 workers.
The UAE is run by absolute monarchies.
With no freedom of expression and no right to protest or form unions, it's routine to exploit the laborers who are building almost $400 billion worth of construction projects currently underway in Dubai alone.
There are roughly five million migrant workers in the UAE, making up over half the population.
Some of these workers let us into their homes, but to keep them safe, we had to conceal their identities.
So this is two buildings with a bit of corrugated iron across the middle.
It looks a bit like a communal kitchen, washing area.
So when some people leave, other people come in and take their place on the floor?
Cancel the visa?
In the next room, we met workers who had similar stories, but were working for a subcontractor building a golf course bearing the name of one of America's leading presidential candidates.
There is a big development called the Trump International Golf Club.
Is that where you worked recently?
Is this the entrance?
When you were at home in Pakistan, what were you told that made you want to come to Dubai?
If you could have anything, all you would want is to be promised the 10 dirhams per hour, that's three dollars, roughly, instead of the five dirhams, $1.50, that you are being paid.
That's all you ask for.
Did you have to pay a visa fee?
So, at the money you are being paid now, how long will it take you just to pay off the visa fee?
Anderson:
So that's two years' work, just to break even.
And these men are charged nearly another year's salary for a visa renewal fee.
Charging the workers these fees is illegal here in the UAE.
Why don't you just go home?
If you're not actually making money here?
Anderson:
And there's another illegal but commonly used tactic for subcontractors to keep the workers in place.
How many of you, when you arrived, had your passports taken away by the company?
Anderson:
These workers now find themselves trapped, and working on a development which bears both Trump's name and face, helping to sell the million dollar plus homes that will soon be complete.
Trump himself came to formally launch the project.
We're building Trump International Golf Club, and it's going to be spectacular.
Right in Dubai, and it's going to be something very, very special.
Anderson:
I visited the same showroom to see how it's now being sold.
Anderson:
Good to meet you.
Good, thank you.
And the golf course is another Trump International Golf Course?
Does he just give his name to the development or is he involved in...
Right.
So Trump does the bigger villas, the golf course, the clubhouse.
Yeah.
In the UK, sometimes in the newspaper, you read stories about how the laborers who come from India, Pakistan, like they get treated very badly.
So it's important for us to know, like...
So DAMAC and Trump, they treat them... they treat them good?
Yeah?
Never had any issues?
Oh, good.
We don't want to move in, and then one year later hear a story about...
Yeah.
Anderson:
Dr. Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch has been documenting migrant worker abuse for over a decade.
He wasn't surprised by our findings.
Almost everyone we interviewed, they sort of describe being promised one thing in their home countries, and they're arriving and getting a nasty shock.
What happens, yes, is workers sign a contract in, wherever, Bangladesh, you know, and they arrive in the UAE, they find that they sign another contract for half of what they were promised.
Then, their passports are taken away from them.
Then, their visa costs and travel costs are added on.
So very quickly they move from a situation where they owe double what they thought they owed, and they're paid half of what they expected to be paid.
Their passport's gone, and they're bound to the one employer and can't change.
Very quickly it starts to look like, in many cases, a trafficking network because of the deception involved in their recruitment.
And when they're there, in the worst cases, you actually have workers subjected to forced labor.
The workers don't want much.
They just want what they were promised, which isn't a whole lot.
The system has been built up in such a way that everybody knows they can make money.
Nothing to be gained from being ethical.
Why would you be ethical when you can make so much money from being unethical, and you're never going to be prosecuted for it?
The Dubai that's sold to you in tourist brochures and is emblazoned across every building you can see or adverts, it doesn't reflect the actual reality, which is a lot darker.
Anderson:
Trump declined to be interviewed for this piece, but his organization stated:
They instead put the responsibility on Trump's UAE partner, DAMAC, who told us:
The Trump organization added that if any labor infractions were proven, they would insist that DAMAC investigate.
So even by the unbelievably low standards of Dubai, the guys living 18 or 21 to a villa are getting treated really, really badly.
But just to make sure that the company doing that to them isn't one bad apple,
I am going to follow back a bunch of other buses ferrying workers who are still working on the Trump golf course to see how they are getting treated, and see how it compares to the guys we have already met.
We followed buses full of workers as they left the site.
They drove for miles out of the city and into the desert.
Eventually, there wasn't even a road.
After a two hour drive, they reached their destination.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere, this camp was also awful, and we heard many of the same stories.
Anderson:
They're working on the golf course?
Akoya and Trump?
Yeah.
How many people share this?
Ah, so one gas hob with two things is for one room.
So this small kitchen serves roughly 150 workers.
Must be very busy in here at dinner time.
Just outside the kitchen door was a bathroom that didn't look fit for human beings.
This is... shower?
This is the washing area, bathroom?
Ugh.
You can smell the sewage.
Is it better here or in Pakistan?
It's better at home.
Can you go home?
Anderson:
Whatever his stated level of involvement,
Trump makes lots of money from licensing his name and brand to projects like this.
But while that might be ethically dubious for a businessman, one would think it would raise serious questions for a presidential candidate.
Meanwhile, the workers in Dubai remain trapped, with no hope that things might change.
Anderson:
Yeah.
Do you think there's any chance things will improve?
♪ ♪
China's economy has seen incredible growth since they embraced the free market 40 years ago.
And one of the major factors that keeps this industrial juggernaut going is China's multi-billion dollar trade and investment deals in developing countries in Africa.
Now that's having a huge impact on modernization efforts on the continent, but what we wanted to find out is what Africa's giving up in return.
♪ ♪
(crowd cheering)
Yeung:
And it appears to be working.
China has leveraged its influence across the continent with these enormous gifts, surpassing Britain, France, and the US.
as Africa's leading foreign business partner.
We spoke with Dr. Paul Tembe, a China studies analyst, about the broader implications of this phenomenon.
What is the kind of scale that we're looking at when it comes to China's presence in Africa?
What about politically and socially?
Yeung:
This type of pro-Chinese influence, you see all across Africa.
(speaking Chinese)
Especially in the Congo.
In Kinshasa, the Chinese sponsored development is happening everywhere.
Moise Ekanga, one of the country's main negotiators with the Chinese, showed us around.
(speaking French)
This is like a mini Tiananmen Square?
Yeah.
(woman speaking)
(Yeung)
(woman)
(speaking Chinese)
How much of the city is built by the Chinese?
Seventy percent?
That's a lot.
Yeung:
Much of this infrastructure was funded by the $6.2 billion trade contract that was originally signed by the two governments in 2008.
(speaking French)
One of the things that the West sees is that China and the DRC are becoming closer and closer.
And with that, China gets more and more power, and more and more say over the potential politics and the direction of the country.
What do you say to that?
Can we get a tour of Sicomines through you?
I think you're able to arrange that for us, right?
Yes, we will do it.
Excellent.
♪ ♪
Yeung:
We're at the Sicomines mine in Kolwezi, which is the biggest infrastructure for resources deal that this country has ever, ever seen.
And the scale of this is insanely huge.
There are about 3,000 workers working here.
They've only just started production last week, but things are well under way here.
And there's a lot of Chinese people following us with cameras, scrutinizing our every move.
Hi. (Speaks Chinese)
(nervous laughter)
Uh... (speaking Chinese)
We were told by Mr. Moise Ekanga that we had full access to this mine, and we thought we could interview the people here and talk about the deal, and it turns out, that now we've got here, no one wants to go on camera
to actually answer any specific questions.
To find out why the Chinese workers might be hesitant to talk about Sicomines, we met with the former speaker of Congo's assembly,
Vital Kamerhe.
(speaking French)
Does the average Congolese person benefit at all from this deal?
Contracts like the Sicomines deal have spurred an enormous wave of Chinese investment across the continent.
In the DRC, Chinese entrepreneurs are rapidly gaining ground in the mining industry.
(speaking Chinese)
Yeung:
Most of these Chinese businessmen are wary of Western press.
But we did find one who was happy to open up.
We are in a golf course in Congo, and I'm about to play my first game of golf, ever, with Mr. Tang and his friend, both of whom are Chinese entrepreneurs.
I believe this is called a driver.
Just a practice swing.
(laughing)
Yeung:
How is life for you, living out here?
And what did you think when you first moved here?
What were your impressions?
Free?
(speaking Chinese)
(chuckling)
Yeung:
Olivier Tang is the owner of Da Tang Steel, a company that specializes in making steel balls to pulverize raw ore.
Can I ask how much you pay your Congolese workers?
Is it easy to find people to come and work for that salary?
Yeung:
Critics have argued that the low wages
Chinese companies pay are part of a broader pattern of labor exploitation.
We met with a former employee of CDM, one of the biggest Chinese smelting firms in the Congo.
(speaking French)
What was the Chinese manager's reaction when you got these burns?
Yeung:
CDM didn't respond to our request for comment.
But human rights groups have uncovered additional claims of abuse from company workers, including low pay, safety neglect, and physical abuse.
A number of protests and strikes over issues like these have sprung up all over Africa, several of which have ended in violence.
But that hasn't stopped the stunning pace of economic growth here.
China has taken advantage of this growth by diversifying its interests into all sectors of the economy.
And as cities like Nairobi solidify their positions as global capitals, it's Chinese companies that are there to help them build.
Why do you think that the Kenyan government chooses
Chinese companies to build these kind of buildings?
(speaking Chinese)
Yeung:
The centerpiece of the Kenyan development boom is the new Standard Gauge Railway, which will run from the port city of Mombasa to the capital.
Yeung:
How much is this project costing?
How big is that in the history of Kenyan loans?
Who is actually going to pay for that?
And do you think that's fair?
To the Kenyans?
Yeung:
But the terms of Kenya's deal with China have come in for harsh criticism from economists like David Ndii.
Yeung:
And even though the growth of the Chinese economy has slowed, its commitment to Africa has not wavered.
(speaking Chinese)
Yeung:
President Xi Jinping announced that China would triple his country's investment in Africa to $60 billion.
Yeung:
And that's exactly what China is doing, as its foreign investment model and its influence are quickly spreading around the world.
So if China continues with its non-interference policy, surely, it's propping up corrupt governments throughout Africa?
There is no doubt that the rise of China and Africa, a country which never was our colonizer, will have a far-reaching impact in international relations.
Long live the Africa-China cooperation.
Yeung:
What is Africa's significance when it comes to the West versus the East and the battle for ideologies?
China is not a democratic country.
Do you see that as playing out to be more of an issue in the future of Africa?

Trump makes lots of money from licensing his name and brand to projects like this.
But while that might be ethically dubious for a businessman, one would think it would raise serious questions for a presidential candidate.
Meanwhile, the workers in Dubai remain trapped, with no hope that things might change.
Anderson:
Yeah.
Do you think there's any chance things will improve?
China's economy has seen incredible growth since they embraced the free market 40 years ago.
And one of the major factors that keeps this industrial juggernaut going is China's multi-billion dollar trade and investment deals in developing countries in Africa.
Now that's having a huge impact on modernization efforts on the continent, but what we wanted to find out is what Africa's giving up in return.
Yeung:
And it appears to be working.
China has leveraged its influence across the continent with these enormous gifts, surpassing Britain, France, and the US.
as Africa's leading foreign business partner.
We spoke with Dr. Paul Tembe, a China studies analyst, about the broader implications of this phenomenon.
What is the kind of scale that we're looking at when it comes to China's presence in Africa?
What about politically and socially?
Yeung:
This type of pro-Chinese influence, you see all across Africa.
Especially in the Congo.
In Kinshasa, the Chinese sponsored development is happening everywhere.
Moise Ekanga, one of the country's main negotiators with the Chinese, showed us around.
This is like a mini Tiananmen Square?
Yeah.
How much of the city is built by the Chinese?
Seventy percent?
That's a lot.
Yeung:
Much of this infrastructure was funded by the $6.2 billion trade contract that was originally signed by the two governments in 2008.
One of the things that the West sees is that China and the DRC are becoming closer and closer.
And with that, China gets more and more power, and more and more say over the potential politics and the direction of the country.
What do you say to that?
Can we get a tour of Sicomines through you?
I think you're able to arrange that for us, right?
Yes, we will do it.
Excellent.
Yeung:
We're at the Sicomines mine in Kolwezi, which is the biggest infrastructure for resources deal that this country has ever, ever seen.
And the scale of this is insanely huge.
There are about 3,000 workers working here.
They've only just started production last week, but things are well under way here.
And there's a lot of Chinese people following us with cameras, scrutinizing our every move.
Hi.
Uh...
We were told by Mr. Moise Ekanga that we had full access to this mine, and we thought we could interview the people here and talk about the deal, and it turns out, that now we've got here, no one wants to go on camera
to actually answer any specific questions.
To find out why the Chinese workers might be hesitant to talk about Sicomines, we met with the former speaker of Congo's assembly,
Vital Kamerhe.
Does the average Congolese person benefit at all from this deal?
Contracts like the Sicomines deal have spurred an enormous wave of Chinese investment across the continent.
In the DRC, Chinese entrepreneurs are rapidly gaining ground in the mining industry.
Yeung:
Most of these Chinese businessmen are wary of Western press.
But we did find one who was happy to open up.
We are in a golf course in Congo, and I'm about to play my first game of golf, ever, with Mr. Tang and his friend, both of whom are Chinese entrepreneurs.
I believe this is called a driver.
Just a practice swing.
Yeung:
How is life for you, living out here?
And what did you think when you first moved here?
What were your impressions?
Free?
Yeung:
Olivier Tang is the owner of Da Tang Steel, a company that specializes in making steel balls to pulverize raw ore.
Can I ask how much you pay your Congolese workers?
Is it easy to find people to come and work for that salary?
Yeung:
Critics have argued that the low wages
Chinese companies pay are part of a broader pattern of labor exploitation.
We met with a former employee of CDM, one of the biggest Chinese smelting firms in the Congo.
What was the Chinese manager's reaction when you got these burns?
Yeung:
CDM didn't respond to our request for comment.
But human rights groups have uncovered additional claims of abuse from company workers, including low pay, safety neglect, and physical abuse.
A number of protests and strikes over issues like these have sprung up all over Africa, several of which have ended in violence.
But that hasn't stopped the stunning pace of economic growth here.
China has taken advantage of this growth by diversifying its interests into all sectors of the economy.
And as cities like Nairobi solidify their positions as global capitals, it's Chinese companies that are there to help them build.
Why do you think that the Kenyan government chooses
Chinese companies to build these kind of buildings?
Yeung:
The centerpiece of the Kenyan development boom is the new Standard Gauge Railway, which will run from the port city of Mombasa to the capital.
Yeung:
How much is this project costing?
How big is that in the history of Kenyan loans?
Who is actually going to pay for that?
And do you think that's fair?
To the Kenyans?
Yeung:
But the terms of Kenya's deal with China have come in for harsh criticism from economists like David Ndii.
Yeung:
And even though the growth of the Chinese economy has slowed, its commitment to Africa has not wavered.
Yeung:
President Xi Jinping announced that China would triple his country's investment in Africa to $60 billion.
Yeung:
And that's exactly what China is doing, as its foreign investment model and its influence are quickly spreading around the world.
So if China continues with its non-interference policy, surely, it's propping up corrupt governments throughout Africa?
There is no doubt that the rise of China and Africa, a country which never was our colonizer, will have a far-reaching impact in international relations.
Long live the Africa-China cooperation.
Yeung:
What is Africa's significance when it comes to the West versus the East and the battle for ideologies?
China is not a democratic country.
Do you see that as playing out to be more of an issue in the future of Africa?
- I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
- They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
- I know.
It's like we're being punished.
- We are, for going to Florida.
- Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
- Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
- You're going to do the fbp?
- That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing the full bullpen!
Here we go.
- * and we can build this dream together * * standing strong forever *
* nothing's gonna stop us now * * and if this world runs out of lovers * * we'll still have each other * * nothing's gonna stop us *
* nothing's gonna stop us now *
- No!
- Oh, no!
I can't stop!
- The full bullpen!
- Those chuckle-heads from the nine-five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
- Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
- So why are the nine-five on the news?
- They're investigating death threats against some author named Do Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
- DC Parlov?
Did you say do Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire cycle!"
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the sepsidians and...
- Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
- No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
- When I was a little kid,
I spent hours reading those books.
- Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
- I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote do Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
- I hope it's not a severed head.
Sand into glass:
"The reckoning of Ka'lar."
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
- It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends."
- Oh, boy.
- "You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov."
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
- Yeah, little Terry got buff-a!
- Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
- Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
- You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
- Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
Marie Callender was a real bitch.
- Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
- Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in butt thumb, Iowa?
- No, it's pronounced "beaut-Hume,"
and Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
- Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
- Aruba?
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
- Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
- Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
- "Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
- Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
- Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
- And now it's a scene.
- It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
- It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, mama.
- Pass.
- Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
- And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
- Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
- It's the "Monty hall problem." Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
- You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door.
The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door.
Should you do it?
- No.
- Yes.
It's simple math.
- It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
- It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
- Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
- You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
- Hey, sarge, great news.
The guys at the nine-five gave us the do Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
- Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,
I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
- "Hey."
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
Give him the benefit of the doubt, sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
- No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
- Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
- Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
- All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good lord!
Keep fanning them!
Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
- Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the nine-nine.
- Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
- Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted
New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce mister sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Sarge?
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
- Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
- I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon, did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
- Qwandor is not a sexual being.
- For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
- Uh, he's not a killer.
Tell him about the inscription.
- You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago,
I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription,
"we all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
- I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the cloud rock says...
"You found yourself in your struggle."
- Wow.
"The truth is what you came for", and you found it within your strife."
- Well, that was cool.
- "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.
"Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan."
- "Tolgan."
Is it over?
- Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
- You have three kids, Terry.
- I said what I said!
- All right.
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
- Up high.
- Down low.
Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
- Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
- Oh.
- Mervyn's.
- Oh.
- Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
- Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
- Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite...
Egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese...
Hard boiled egg on the side.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
- N...
I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
- In what universe?
- I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
- Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
- 13-2, Iowa.
- For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
- You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
- I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Sam, come.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
- Stay.
- All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
- Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book,
"A bridge to Jarcata."
- Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a."
All the t's in "Skyfire" are silent.
- This book sounds impossible to read.
- I know, right?
- Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
- And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
- To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
- You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "die hard."
- There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
- We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
- Ooh, "smorf."
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
- No.
No, we're not.
- * yeah *
- * so I'm outside of da club * * and you think I'm a punk *
- Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
- There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
- Good evening, sir.
- No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
- Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
- Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
- Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
- I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
- Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voice-mail about kindergarten statistics.
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
- 'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats."
- That was the name!
It was so cool.
- It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
- What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean...
That's not what I think.
Captain dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
- Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
- To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
- You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
- Oh, my god, I hate these books.
- Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
- Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
- You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish."
- Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
- This is a start, but if you really want
Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
- I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
- Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
- Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
- No.
She hates it.
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Uh, this writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
- Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
- Why not?
- Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
- Terry did not see that coming.
- And that is a perfect match.
- This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
- For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
- Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
- Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
- He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
- Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake per...
Oh, no!
- Wha...
Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
- You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
- It doesn't?
Oh, my god, why did I share that story?
- There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
- Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
- Actually...
It's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
- Are you trying to Monty hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty hall ruining my place of work when Monty hall has already ruined my home life.
- Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
You two just need to bone.
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
I said you two need to bone.
- How... dare you, detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
Bone!
What happens in my bedroom, detective, is none of your business.
Bone?
!
Don't ever speak to me like that again.
- Why did you do that?
- Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
- The council of the cousins.
- Look at them.
It's like a beige of pigs.
- Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
- That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
- Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, bill,
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
"Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's...
Iowa."
- Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this:
One long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
- Do we really wanna go where "pirates of the Caribbean"
took place?
- Yes!
No!
That movie gave us nightmares for moths!
- Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
- In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Hey.
- What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
- Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy Sci-Fi fans, or...
Good lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
- I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
- Okay, stop saying "pulls."
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
- Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
- Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
- The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
- Yeah, tell you the truth,
I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
What?
- Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
- But you said you remembered me.
- Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
- Yeah, that's a cool story.
- After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.
- Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
- Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or...
Yep yep.
That works, too.
- Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
- I don't feel like kicking down doors.
- What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
- Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
- Look, sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
- It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
- No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pants-ed.
- How many Knicks have you pants-ed?
- Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
- That's my soap.
I got it at lush.
- You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
- Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
- Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
- All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
- We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
- Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
- Yes, you are.
- What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
- Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
- Yeah, so I could win.
- And you did win...
A plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
- "Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
- Oh, captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty hall, but I did contact a math...
- No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
- So the fight with Kevin is over?
- Yep.
- Because you understand the math now?
- Nope.
- Because you guys...
- Yep.
- Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
- Okay, Rosa.
- Edmund grail?
- Who wants to know?
- NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about do Parlov.
- Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
- Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
- Taste the might of Ka'lar!
Get him out of here.
- Nice work, sarge.
- You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry chronicles.
The arrest of Edmund grail.
- Followed by book two:
The ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
- I couldn't let you down.
- And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop...
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
I know.
It's like we're being punished.
We are, for going to Florida.
Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
You're going to do the FBP?
That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing The Full Bullpen!

Those chuckleheads from the Nine-Five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
[ska music playing]
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
So why are the Nine-Five on the news?
They're investigating death threats against some author named DC Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
DC Parlov?
Did you say DC Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire Cycle!"
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the Sepsidians and...
Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
When I was a little kid,
I spent hours reading those books.
Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote DC Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
I hope it's not a severed head.
"The Skyfire Cycle:
Sand Into Glass:
The Reckoning of Ka'Lar."
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends.
Oh, boy.
"You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov."
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
Yeah, Little Terry got buff-a!
Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, Little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
- [laughs]
- Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
[whispering] Marie Callender was a real bitch.
Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in Butt Thumb, Iowa?
No, it's pronounced "Beaut-Hume,"
And Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
Aruba?
[laughs]
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
"Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
And now it's a scene.
It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, Mama.
- Pass.
Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
It's the "Monty Hall problem." Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door.
The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door.
Should you do it?
- No.
- Yes.
Both:
It's simple math.
It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
Hey, Sarge, great news.
The guys at the Nine-Five gave us the DC Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
- Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,
I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
"Hey."
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
[laughs] Give him the benefit of the doubt, Sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good Lord!
Keep fanning them!
- Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted
New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce Mister Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
[chuckles] Sarge?
[meek voice] Hi.
Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
[chuckles]
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon,
Did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
Qwandor is not a sexual being.
For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
Uh, he's not a killer.
[laughs]
Tell him about the inscription.
You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago,
I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription,
"We all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the Cloud Rock says... both: "You found yourself in your struggle."
Wow.
Both: "The truth is what you came for, and you found it within your strife."
Well, that was cool.
- Both: "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.
Both: "Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan."
"Tolgan."
Is it over?
Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
You have three kids, Terry.
I said what I said!
All right.
[laughs]
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
Up high.
Down low.
Both:
Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
Oh.
Both:
Mervyn's.
Oh.
[both laughing]
Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite... egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese... both:
Hard boiled egg on the side.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
N...
I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
In what universe?
I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
13-2, Iowa.
For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
[groans] I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
Sam, stay.
- Sam, come. [whistles]
- Sam, stay.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
- [clicks tongue] Stay.
All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book,
"The Skyfire Cycle:
A Bridge to Jarcata."
Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a."
All the T's in "Skyfire" are silent.
This book sounds impossible to read.
[laughs] I know, right?
Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "Die Hard."
There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
Ooh, "smorf."
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
No.
No, we're not.
[Bone Crusher's "Never Scared"]
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ So I'm outside of da club ♪
♪ And you think I'm a punk ♪
Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
Good evening, sir.
No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voicemail about kindergarten statistics.
[sighs]
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to Captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats."
That was the name!
It was so cool.
It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean...[chuckles] That's not what I think.
- Captain Dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
Oh, my God, I hate these books.
Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish."
Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
This is a start, but if you really want
Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
[grunts]
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed Prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
No.
She hates it.
Yeah, makes sense.
Uh, This writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
Why not?
Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
Terry did not see that coming.
And that is a perfect match.
This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake Per...
- Oh, no!
- Wha...
- Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
It doesn't?
Oh, my God, why did I share that story?
There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
[sighs, blows raspberries]
Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
Actually... it's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
Are you trying to Monty Hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty Hall ruining my place of work when Monty Hall has already ruined my home life.
Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
- You two just need to bone.
- [chuckles nervously]
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
- I said you two need to bone.
- [whimpers]
How... dare you, Detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
[shouting] Bone!
[sternly] What happens in my bedroom, Detective, is none of your business.
[shouting] Bone?
!
[calmly] Don't ever speak to me like that again.
Why did you do that?
Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
The council of the cousins.
Look at them.
It's like a Beige of Pigs.
Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated
- in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of Don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
- And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, Bill,
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
Papa Boyle once said:
"Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's...
Iowa."
Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this:
one long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
Do we really wanna go where "Pirates of the Caribbean"
- took place?
- Yes!
- [cheers and applause]
- No!
That movie gave us nightmares for moths!
[crowd groans]
Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. Nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
I love you.
All:
I love you.
I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
[laughs] I love you.
All:
I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
I love you.
All:
I love you.
[knocking at the door]
Hey.
What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy sci-fi fans, or...
Good Lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
Okay, stop saying "pulls."
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
- We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
Yeah, tell you the truth,
I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
Both:
What?
Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
But you said you remembered me.
Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund Grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
Yeah, that's a cool story.
After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
- It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.
Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or... [pages rip]
Yep yep.
That works, too.
Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
I don't feel like kicking down doors.
What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
Look, Sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pantsed.
How many Knicks have you pantsed?
Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
That's my soap.
I got it at Lush.
You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
[both gasp quietly]
All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the Temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
Yes, you are.
What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
Yeah, so I could win.
And you did win... a plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
"Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
Oh, Captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty Hall, but I did contact a math...
No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
So the fight with Kevin is over?
Yep.
Because you understand the math now?
Nope.
- Because you guys...
- Yep.
Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
Okay, Rosa.
[knock at door]
Edmund Grail?
Who wants to know?
NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about DC Parlov.
Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
[faint clattering]
Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
[grunts]
Taste the might of Ka'Lar!
Get him out of here.
Nice work, Sarge.
You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry Chronicles.
Book One:
The Arrest of Edmund Grail.
Followed by Book Two:
The Ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
I couldn't let you down.
And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop...
[grunts]
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
- I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
- They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
- I know.
It's like we're being punished.
- We are, for going to Florida.
- Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
- Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
- You're going to do the FBP?
- That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing the full bullpen!
Here we go.
- No!
- Oh, no!
I can't stop!
- The full bullpen!
- Those chuckle-heads from the nine-five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
- Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
- So why are the nine-five on the news?
- They're investigating death threats against some author named Do Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
- DC Parlov?
Did you say do Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire cycle!"
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the sepsidians and...
- Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
- No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
- When I was a little kid,
I spent hours reading those books.
- Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
- I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote do Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
- I hope it's not a severed head.
Sand into glass:
"The reckoning of Ka'lar."
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
- It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends."
- Oh, boy.
- "You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov."
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
- Yeah, little Terry got buff-a!
- Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
- Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
- You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
- Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
Marie Callender was a real bitch.
- Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
- Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in butt thumb, Iowa?
- No, it's pronounced "beaut-Hume,"
and Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
- Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
- Aruba?
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
- Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
- Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
- "Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
- Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
- Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
- And now it's a scene.
- It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
- It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, mama.
- Pass.
- Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
- And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
- Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
- It's the "Monty hall problem." Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
- You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door.
The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door.
Should you do it?
- No.
- Yes.
It's simple math.
- It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
- It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
- Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
- You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
- Hey, sarge, great news.
The guys at the nine-five gave us the do Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
- Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,
I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
- "Hey."
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
Give him the benefit of the doubt, sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
- No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
- Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
- Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
- All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good lord!
Keep fanning them!
Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
- Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the nine-nine.
- Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
- Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted.
New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce mister sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Sarge?
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
- Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
- I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon, did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
- Qwandor is not a sexual being.
- For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
- Uh, he's not a killer.
Tell him about the inscription.
- You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago,
I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription,
"we all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
- I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the cloud rock says...
"You found yourself in your struggle."
- Wow.
"The truth is what you came for", and you found it within your strife."
- Well, that was cool.
- "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.
"Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan."
- "Tolgan."
- Is it over?
- Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
- You have three kids, Terry.
- I said what I said!
- All right.
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
- Up high.
- Down low.
Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
- Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
- Oh.
- Mervyn's.
- Oh.
- Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
- Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
- Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite...
Egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese...
Hard boiled egg on the side.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
- N...
I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
- In what universe?
- I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
- Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
- 13-2, Iowa.
- For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
- You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
- I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Sam, come.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
- Stay.
- All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
- Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book,
"A bridge to Jarcata."
- Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a."
All the t's in "Skyfire" are silent.
- This book sounds impossible to read.
- I know, right?
- Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
- And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
- To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
- You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "die hard."
- There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
- We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
- Ooh, "smorf."
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
- No.
No, we're not.
- Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
- There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
- Good evening, sir.
- No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
- Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
- Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
- Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
- I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
- Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voice-mail about kindergarten statistics.
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
- 'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats."
- That was the name!
It was so cool.
- It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
- What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean...
That's not what I think.
Captain dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
- Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
- To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
- You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
- Oh, my god, I hate these books.
- Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
- Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
- You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish."
- Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
- This is a start, but if you really want.
Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
- I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
- Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
- Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
- No.
She hates it.
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Uh, this writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
- Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
- Why not?
- Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
- Terry did not see that coming.
- And that is a perfect match.
- This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
- For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
- Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
- Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
- He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
- Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake per...
Oh, no!
- Wha...
Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
- You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
- It doesn't?
Oh, my god, why did I share that story?
- There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
- Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
- Actually...
It's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
- Are you trying to Monty hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty hall ruining my place of work when Monty hall has already ruined my home life.
- Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
You two just need to bone.
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
I said you two need to bone.
- How... dare you, detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
Bone!
What happens in my bedroom, detective, is none of your business.
Bone?
!
Don't ever speak to me like that again.
- Why did you do that?
- Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
- The council of the cousins.
- Look at them.
It's like a beige of pigs.
- Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
- That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
- Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, Bill,
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
"Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's...
Iowa."
- Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this:
One long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
- Do we really wanna go where "pirates of the Caribbean"
took place?
- Yes!
No!
That movie gave us nightmares for moths!
- Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
- In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Hey.
- What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
- Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy Sci-Fi fans, or...
Good lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
- I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
- Okay, stop saying "pulls."
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
- Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
- Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
- The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
- Yeah, tell you the truth,
I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
What?
- Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
- But you said you remembered me.
- Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund Grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
- Yeah, that's a cool story.
- After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.
- Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
- Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or...
Yep yep.
That works, too.
- Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
- I don't feel like kicking down doors.
- What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
- Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
- Look, sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
- It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
- No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pants-ed.
- How many Knicks have you pants-ed?
- Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
- That's my soap.
I got it at lush.
- You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
- Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
- Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
- All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
- We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
- Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
- Yes, you are.
- What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
- Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
- Yeah, so I could win.
- And you did win...
A plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
- "Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
- Oh, captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty hall, but I did contact a math...
- No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
- So the fight with Kevin is over?
- Yep.
- Because you understand the math now?
- Nope.
- Because you guys...
- Yep.
- Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
- Okay, Rosa.
- Edmund Grail?
- Who wants to know?
- NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about do Parlov.
- Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
- Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
- Taste the might of Ka'lar!
Get him out of here.
- Nice work, sarge.
- You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry chronicles.
The arrest of Edmund Grail.
- Followed by book two:
The ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
- I couldn't let you down.
- And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop...
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
- I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
- They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
- I know.
It's like we're being punished.
- We are, for going to Florida.
- Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
- Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
- You're going to do the fbp?
- That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing the full bullpen!
Here we go.
- No!
- Oh, no!
I can't stop!
- The full bullpen!
- Those chuckle-heads from the nine-five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
- Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
- So why are the nine-five on the news?
- They're investigating death threats against some author named Do Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
- DC Parlov?
Did you say do Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire cycle!"
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the sepsidians and...
- Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
- No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
- When I was a little kid,
I spent hours reading those books.
- Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
- I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote do Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
- I hope it's not a severed head.
Sand into glass:
"The reckoning of Ka'lar."
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
- It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends."
- Oh, boy.
- "You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov."
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
- Yeah, little Terry got buff-a!
- Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
- Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
- You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
- Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
Marie Callender was a real bitch.
- Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
- Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in butt thumb, Iowa?
- No, it's pronounced "beaut-Hume,"
and Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
- Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
- Aruba?
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
- Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
- Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
- "Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
- Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
- Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
- And now it's a scene.
- It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
- It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, mama.
- Pass.
- Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
- And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
- Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
- It's the "Monty hall problem." Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.

The prize is behind one of two doors.

Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
- You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
- Hey, sarge, great news.
The guys at the nine-five gave us the do Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
- Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,
I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
- "Hey."
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
Give him the benefit of the doubt, sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
- No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
- Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
- Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
- All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good lord!
Keep fanning them!
Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
- Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the nine-nine.
- Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
- Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted
New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce mister sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Sarge?
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
- Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
- I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon, did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
- Qwandor is not a sexual being.
- For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
- Uh, he's not a killer.
Tell him about the inscription.
- You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago,
I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription,
"we all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
- I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the cloud rock says...
"You found yourself in your struggle."
- Wow.
"The truth is what you came for", and you found it within your strife."
- Well, that was cool.
- "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.
"Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan."
- "Tolgan."
Is it over?
- Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
- You have three kids, Terry.
- I said what I said!
- All right.
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
- Up high.
- Down low.
Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
- Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
- Oh.
- Mervyn's.
- Oh.
- Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
- Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
- Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite...
Egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese...
Hard boiled egg on the side.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
- N...
I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
- In what universe?
- I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
- Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
- 13-2, Iowa.
- For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
- You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
- I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Sam, come.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
- Stay.
- All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
- Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book,
"A bridge to Jarcata."
- Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a."
All the t's in "Skyfire" are silent.
- This book sounds impossible to read.
- I know, right?
- Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
- And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
- To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
- You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "die hard."
- There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
- We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
- Ooh, "smorf."
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
- No.
No, we're not.
- Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
- There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
- Good evening, sir.
- No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
- Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
- Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
- Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
- I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
- Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voice-mail about kindergarten statistics.
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
- 'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats."
- That was the name!
It was so cool.
- It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
- What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean...
That's not what I think.
Captain dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
- Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
- To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
- You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
- Oh, my god, I hate these books.
- Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
- Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
- You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish."
- Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
- This is a start, but if you really want
Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
- I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
- Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
- Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
- No.
She hates it.
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Uh, this writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
- Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
- Why not?
- Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
- Terry did not see that coming.
- And that is a perfect match.
- This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
- For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
- Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
- Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
- He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
- Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake per...
Oh, no!
- Wha...
Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
- You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
- It doesn't?
Oh, my god, why did I share that story?
- There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
- Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
- Actually...
It's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
- Are you trying to Monty hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty hall ruining my place of work when Monty hall has already ruined my home life.
- Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
You two just need to bone.
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
I said you two need to bone.
- How... dare you, detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
Bone!
What happens in my bedroom, detective, is none of your business.
Bone?
!
Don't ever speak to me like that again.
- Why did you do that?
- Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
- The council of the cousins.
- Look at them.
It's like a beige of pigs.
- Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
- That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
- Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, bill,
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
"Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's...
Iowa."
- Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this:
One long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
- Do we really wanna go where "pirates of the Caribbean"
took place?
- Yes!
No!
That movie gave us nightmares for moths!
- Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
- In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Hey.
- What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
- Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy Sci-Fi fans, or...
Good lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
- I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
- Okay, stop saying "pulls."
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
- Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
- Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
- The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
- Yeah, tell you the truth,
I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
What?
- Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
- But you said you remembered me.
- Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
- Yeah, that's a cool story.
- After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.
- Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
- Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or...
Yep yep.
That works, too.
- Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
- I don't feel like kicking down doors.
- What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
- Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
- Look, sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
- It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
- No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pants-ed.
- How many Knicks have you pants-ed?
- Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
- That's my soap.
I got it at lush.
- You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
- Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
- Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
- All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
- We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
- Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
- Yes, you are.
- What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
- Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
- Yeah, so I could win.
- And you did win...
A plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
- "Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
- Oh, captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty hall, but I did contact a math...
- No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
- So the fight with Kevin is over?
- Yep.
- Because you understand the math now?
- Nope.
- Because you guys...
- Yep.
- Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
- Okay, Rosa.
- Edmund grail?
- Who wants to know?
- NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about do Parlov.
- Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
- Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
- Taste the might of Ka'lar!
Get him out of here.
- Nice work, sarge.
- You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry chronicles.
The arrest of Edmund grail.
- Followed by book two:
The ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
- I couldn't let you down.
- And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop...
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
- I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
- They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
- I know.
It's like we're being punished.
- We are, for going to Florida.
- Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
- Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
- You're going to do the fbp?
- That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing the full bullpen!
[Bell dings]
[Breathing deeply]
[Dramatic music]
* * here we go.
* * [sharp breaths]
[Starship's "nothing's gonna stop us now"]
- * and we can build this dream together * * standing strong forever *
[Terry cheers in slo-mo] * nothing's gonna stop us now * * and if this world runs out of lovers * * we'll still have each other * * nothing's gonna stop us * [all screaming "no" in slo-mo]
* nothing's gonna stop us now *
- no!
- [Mouthing words]
- Oh, no!
I can't stop!
[Elevator dings]
- The full bullpen!
[Upbeat music]
* *
- those chuckle-heads from the nine-five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
- Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
[Ska music playing]
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
- So why are the nine-five on the news?
- They're investigating death threats against some author named Do Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
- DC Parlov?
Did you say do Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire cycle!"
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the sepsidians and...
- Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
- No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
- When I was a little kid,
I spent hours reading those books.
- Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
- I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote do Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
- I hope it's not a severed head.
- "The Skyfire cycle:
Sand into glass:
The reckoning of Ka'lar."
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
- It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends."
- Oh, boy.
- "You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov."
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
- Yeah, little Terry got buff-a!
- Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
- Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
- You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
[Laughs]
- Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
- Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
[Whispering] Marie Callender was a real bitch.
- Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
- Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in butt thumb, Iowa?
- No, it's pronounced "beaut-Hume,"
and Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
- Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
- Aruba?
[Laughs]
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
- Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
- Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
- "Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
- Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
- Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
- And now it's a scene.
- It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
- It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, mama.
- Pass.
- Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
- And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
- Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
- It's the "Monty hall problem." Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
- You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door.
The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door.
Should you do it?
- No.
- Yes.
Both:
It's simple math.
- It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
- It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
- Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
- You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
- Hey, sarge, great news.
The guys at the nine-five gave us the do Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
- Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,
I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
- "Hey."
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
[Laughs] Give him the benefit of the doubt, sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
- No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
- Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
- Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
- All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good lord!
Keep fanning them!
Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
- Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the nine-nine.
- Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
- Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted
New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce mister sergeant Terry Jeffords.
[Chuckles] Sarge?
- [Meek voice] Hi.
- Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
[Chuckles]
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
- Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
- I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon, did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
- Qwandor is not a sexual being.
- For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
- Uh, he's not a killer.
[Laughs]
Tell him about the inscription.
- You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago,
I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription,
"we all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
- I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the cloud rock says...
Both: "You found yourself in your struggle."
- Wow.
Both: "The truth is what you came for", and you found it within your strife."
- Well, that was cool.
Both: "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.
Both: "Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan."
- "Tolgan."
Is it over?
- Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
- You have three kids, Terry.
- I said what I said!
- All right.
- [Laughs]
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
- Up high.
- Down low.
Both:
Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
- Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
- Oh.
Both:
Mervyn's.
- Oh.
[Both laughing]
- Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
- Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
- Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite...
Egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese...
Both:
Hard boiled egg on the side.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
- N...
I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
- In what universe?
- I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
- Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
- 13-2, Iowa.
- For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
- You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
- [Groans] I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Sam, come. [Whistles]
- Sam, stay.
- Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
- [Clicks tongue] Stay.
- All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
- Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book,
"the Skyfire cycle:
A bridge to Jarcata."
- Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a."
All the t's in "Skyfire" are silent.
- This book sounds impossible to read.
- [Laughs] I know, right?
- Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
- And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
- To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
- You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "die hard."
- There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
- We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
- Ooh, "smorf."
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
- No.
No, we're not.
[Bone crusher's "never scared"]
- * yeah *
- * so I'm outside of da club * * and you think I'm a punk *
- sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
- There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
- Good evening, sir.
- No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
- Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
- Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
- Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
- I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
- Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
- Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voice-mail about kindergarten statistics.
- [Sighs]
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
- 'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats."
- That was the name!
It was so cool.
- It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
- What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean... [chuckles] That's not what I think.
Captain dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
- Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
- To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
- You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
- Oh, my god, I hate these books.
- Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
- Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
- You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish."
- Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
- This is a start, but if you really want
Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
- I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
[Grunts]
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
- Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
- Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
- No.
She hates it.
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Uh, this writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
- Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
- Why not?
- Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
- Terry did not see that coming.
- And that is a perfect match.
- This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
- For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
- Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
- Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
- He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
- Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake per...
Oh, no!
- Wha...
Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
- You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
- It doesn't?
Oh, my god, why did I share that story?
- There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
- [Sighs, blows raspberries]
- Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
- Actually...
It's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
- Are you trying to Monty hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty hall ruining my place of work when Monty hall has already ruined my home life.
- Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
You two just need to bone.
- [Chuckles nervously]
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
- I said you two need to bone.
- [Whimpers]
- How... dare you, detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
[Shouting] Bone!
[Sternly] What happens in my bedroom, detective, is none of your business.
[Shouting] Bone?
!
[Calmly] Don't ever speak to me like that again.
- Why did you do that?
- Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
- The council of the cousins.
- Look at them.
It's like a beige of pigs.
- Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
- That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
- Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, bill,
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
Papa Boyle once said:
"Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's...
Iowa."
- Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this:
One long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
- Do we really wanna go where "pirates of the Caribbean"
took place?
- Yes!
[Cheers and applause]
- No!
That movie gave us nightmares for moths!
[Crowd groans]
- Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
- In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
I love you.
All:
I love you.
- I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
[Laughs] I love you.
All:
I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
I love you.
All:
I love you.
[Knocking at the door]
- Hey.
- What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
- Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy Sci-Fi fans, or...
Good lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
- I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
- Okay, stop saying "pulls."
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
- Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
- Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
- The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
- Yeah, tell you the truth,
I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
Both:
What?
- Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
- But you said you remembered me.
- Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
- Yeah, that's a cool story.
- After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.
- Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
- Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or...
[Pages rip]
Yep yep.
That works, too.
- Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
- I don't feel like kicking down doors.
- What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
- Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
- Look, sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
- It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
- No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pants-ed.
- How many Knicks have you pants-ed?
- Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
- That's my soap.
I got it at lush.
- You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
- Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
- Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
[Both gasp quietly]
- All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
- We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
- Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
- Yes, you are.
- What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
- Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
- Yeah, so I could win.
- And you did win...
A plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
- "Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
- Oh, captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty hall, but I did contact a math...
- No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
- So the fight with Kevin is over?
- Yep.
- Because you understand the math now?
- Nope.
- Because you guys...
- Yep.
- Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
- Okay, Rosa.
[Knock at door]
- Edmund grail?
- Who wants to know?
- NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about do Parlov.
- Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
[Faint clattering]
- Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
- [Grunts]
- Taste the might of Ka'lar!
Get him out of here.
- Nice work, sarge.
- You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry chronicles.
Book one:
The arrest of Edmund grail.
- Followed by book two:
The ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
- I couldn't let you down.
- And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop...
[Grunts]
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
I know.
It's like we're being punished.
We are, for going to Florida.
Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
You're going to do the FBP?
That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing The Full Bullpen!
Here we go.
♪ And we can build this dream together ♪
♪ Standing strong forever ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna stop us now ♪
♪ And if this world runs out of lovers ♪
♪ We'll still have each other ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna stop us ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna stop us now ♪
No!
Oh, no!
I can't stop!
The Full Bullpen!
Those chuckleheads from the Nine-Five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
So why are the Nine-Five on the news?
They're investigating death threats against some author named DC Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
DC Parlov?
Did you say DC Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire Cycle!"
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the Sepsidians and...
Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
When I was a little kid,
I spent hours reading those books.
Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote DC Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
I hope it's not a severed head.
"The Skyfire Cycle:
Sand Into Glass:
The Reckoning of Ka'Lar."
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends.
Oh, boy.
"You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov."
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
Yeah, Little Terry got buff-a!
Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, Little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
Marie Callender was a real bitch.
Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in Butt Thumb, Iowa?
No, it's pronounced "Beaut-Hume,"
And Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
Aruba?
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
"Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
And now it's a scene.
It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, Mama.
- Pass.
Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
It's the "Monty Hall problem." Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door.
The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door.
Should you do it?
- No.
- Yes.
It's simple math.
It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
Hey, Sarge, great news.
The guys at the Nine-Five gave us the DC Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
- Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,
I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
"Hey."
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
Give him the benefit of the doubt, Sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good Lord!
Keep fanning them!
- Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted
New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce Mister Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Sarge?
Hi.
Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon,
Did you give her big, scaly boobs, or...
I don't know, you're the writer.
Qwandor is not a sexual being.
For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
Uh, he's not a killer.
Tell him about the inscription.
You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago,
I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription,
"We all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the Cloud Rock says...
"You found yourself in your struggle."
Wow.
"The truth is what you came for, and you found it within your strife."
Well, that was cool.
- "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.
"Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan."
"Tolgan."
Is it over?
Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
You have three kids, Terry.
I said what I said!
All right.
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
Up high.
Down low.
Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
- Oh.
- Mervyn's.
Oh.
Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite... egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese...
Hard boiled egg on the side.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
N...
I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
In what universe?
I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but...
Mm, looks like you already got burned.
Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
13-2, Iowa.
For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
Sam, stay.
- Sam, come.
- Sam, stay.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
- Stay.
All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book,
"The Skyfire Cycle:
A Bridge to Jarcata."
Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a."
All the T's in "Skyfire" are silent.
This book sounds impossible to read.
I know, right?
Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "Die Hard."
There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
Ooh, "smorf."
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
No.
No, we're not.
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ So I'm outside of da club ♪
♪ And you think I'm a punk ♪
Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
Good evening, sir.
No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you...
Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voicemail about kindergarten statistics.
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to Captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats."
That was the name!
It was so cool.
It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean...
That's not what I think.
- Captain Dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
Oh, my God, I hate these books.
Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish."
Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
This is a start, but if you really want
Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed Prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
No.
She hates it.
Yeah, makes sense.
Uh, This writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
Why not?
Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
Terry did not see that coming.
And that is a perfect match.
This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake Per...
- Oh, no!
- Wha...
- Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
It doesn't?
Oh, my God, why did I share that story?
There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
Actually... it's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
Are you trying to Monty Hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty Hall ruining my place of work when Monty Hall has already ruined my home life.
Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
You two just need to bone.
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
I said you two need to bone.
How... dare you, Detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
Bone!
What happens in my bedroom, Detective, is none of your business.
Bone?
!
Don't ever speak to me like that again.
Why did you do that?
Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
The council of the cousins.
Look at them.
It's like a Beige of Pigs.
Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated
- in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of Don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
- And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, Bill,
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
Papa Boyle once said:
"Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's...
Iowa."
Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this:
one long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
Do we really wanna go where "Pirates of the Caribbean"
- took place?
- Yes!
No!
That movie gave us nightmares for moths!
Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. Nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
- I love you.
- I love you.
I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Hey.
What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy sci-fi fans, or...
Good Lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
Okay, stop saying "pulls."
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
- We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
Yeah, tell you the truth,
I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
What?
Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
But you said you remembered me.
Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund Grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
Yeah, that's a cool story.
After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
- It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.
Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or...
Yep yep.
That works, too.
Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
I don't feel like kicking down doors.
What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
Look, Sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pantsed.
How many Knicks have you pantsed?
Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
That's my soap.
I got it at Lush.
You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the Temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
Yes, you are.
What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
Yeah, so I could win.
And you did win... a plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
"Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
Oh, Captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty Hall, but I did contact a math...
No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
So the fight with Kevin is over?
Yep.
Because you understand the math now?
Nope.
- Because you guys...
- Yep.
Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
Okay, Rosa.
Edmund Grail?
Who wants to know?
NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about DC Parlov.
Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
Taste the might of Ka'Lar!
Get him out of here.
Nice work, Sarge.
You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry Chronicles.
Book One:
The Arrest of Edmund Grail.
Followed by Book Two:
The Ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
I couldn't let you down.
And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop...
Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
Okay, so get this.
The kids brushed their teeth and went straight to bed.
I think somebody replaced 'em with Pod People.
I mean, I'm gonna miss 'em,
- but I am not complaining.
- (chuckles)
You're welcome.
Oh, you're taking credit for this?
Yes, I am.
Because after school today, your kids were out of control.
Our living room was like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.
Okay, so they're my kids when they do something wrong?
Yeah, or when they're in a school play.
Yeah, three hours of watching Emme be a tree in The Wizard of Oz.
The witch said, "I'm melting."
I was like, "Take me with you."
That's like Club Med compared to what I dealt with today.
While I was on the phone with a client, the kids decided to have a Nerf dart shootout.
Katie nails me in the face, right?
And I open my mouth in surprise, as you do.
Right?
Teddy rolls by on his skateboard and shoots one down my throat.
I coughed up the foam part, but the rubber tip is still inside me somewhere.
Oh, honey.
Yeah, well, it won't happen again because I handled it.
The way you kids behaved today was completely unacceptable, okay?
So from now on, there will be no skateboards, no Nerf wars, no monkey business in the house.
What's a monkey's business?
It's an old person word for fun.
He's trying to ban fun.
That's exactly right, Katie.
I'm banning fun.
So until further notice, all of these... will go in the off-limits cubby.
ALL:
No!
All right, get in there.
I really wish that had a door on it.
God, I wonder why they were so wound up?
Oh, you know what?
It rained today so they didn't have recess.
That always makes 'em a little crazy.
They seemed fine after school at the ice cream place.
You took 'em for ice cream?
Yeah, well, you know I like ice cream.
And if I want to eat it, I got buy them some.
What difference does it make?
I'm just trying to figure out why they were so nuts.
Well, it doesn't matter why.
- I handled it.
- Okay, but you didn't take everything into consideration.
Look, different situations require different reactions.
Like if it were me,
I would have taken 'em to the park, let 'em run it out.
You know, like dogs.
Nah.
Yelling and taking stuff away, that's my move.
Okay, but... now that you're home with the kids more, you might want to expand your playbook.
I don't think so.
I have one move.
My dad had one move.
My dad's dad had one move.
And that one move won two world wars.
Trust me, we didn't take the Germans to the park and let 'em run it out.
I'm telling you, if you put two round hot tubs at the end of a long pool, from the second story balcony, you're gonna get a very... masculine view.
If you know what I'm sayin'.
(chuckling):
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
I will take care of it.
All right, bye.
(chuckling):
Gee.
- Hey.
- Hey, how was your day?
How were the kids?
They were fantastic.
Listen to the sound... (whispers): of silence.
Huh?
My one move... the perfect move... is still working.
In fact, it's so good, I named it:
The Velvet Hammer.
Um, isn't that the name of the gay bar by the ice cream shop?
It doesn't matter where the name came from.
That's what I'm calling it.
Mm-kay, well,
- good for you, honey.
- Mm-kay.
(clunking)
What was that?
I don't know, but it better not be fun.
Something happened in here.
It's quiet.
A little too quiet.
And empty.
A little too empty.
And that rug is on the wall.
A little too on the wall.
Are you done, Columbo?
It's so fun, though.
(both gasping)
Oh, my God, your kids put a hole in the wall.
♪ ♪
Okay, I need to know who made the hole, how they made the hole, and why they tried to hide the hole.
What hole?
The hole in the wall.
You mean, like, the window?
N-No, no.
I mean like that.
Whoa, where did that come from?
You know, I-I think that's always been there.
Maybe we have a mouse.
Um... can I see you in the kitchen?
No!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
Are you?
Okay, you three stay put.
Will you get me a Go-Gurt from the fridge?
What fridge?
See?
Two can play at that game.
What game?
What is going on in there?
Have they ever stonewalled you like that before?
Well, yeah, a few times, but I always had a move.
What was it?
"Wait until your father gets home."
I'm already home.
Yes, that's why we're in the kitchen.
I can't believe they formed an alliance.
Well... it's actually kind of sweet.
I mean, I am always telling them to stick together.
Who knew it would backfire?
Parenting's hard.
Okay, okay, okay.
Hold on.
If they're sticking together, we got to split 'em up, right?
Yes.
And make them understand it's in their best interest to be on our team.
So what are we gonna use, threats or bribes?
Uh, well, threats are free.
Let's start with those.
Good.
Oh, look,
Katie's trophy from when her volleyball team
- won regional's.
- Hmm.
Our girl really does love her volleyball,
- doesn't she?
- Mmm.
What are you guys doing?
You, uh, you have a volleyball camp coming up, don't you?
Yeah.
Boy, I'd hate for you to get grounded and miss it, just because of some stupid hole in the wall.
I don't want to miss my camp.
Here we go.
I mean, if I don't go to camp,
I'd feel bad for you guys.
Um, what's that?
That's the weekend Teddy and Emme are supposed to stay at Grandma and Grandpa's.
You guys are gonna have the whole house to yourself.
Oh, well.
Can I see you in the hall?
Mm-hmm.
We are getting our weekend alone.
I don't care if they burn the house down.
And we never should have started with Katie, that was a rookie mistake.
You're right.
She's too smart.
We need to go to the dumb one.
Hey, hey.
I don't think any of our kids are dumb.
But I will follow you to Teddy's room.
Boy, is this room crowded.
You know, if you had Katie's room, you'd have space to set up all your toys.
But, you said Kate gets the bigger room because she's older.
Ah, she's had her time.
Tell us who made the hole, the room is yours.
Kate said I shouldn't answer any questions without representation.
He's trying to lawyer up.
Wait, where did you learn the word "representation"?
Kate wrote it on my hand.
Are you gonna talk or not?
No.
- Can I see you in the hallway?
- Mm-hmm.
That boy has learned more in an hour with Katie, than he has in five years of school.
What now?
We've only got one kid left.
I don't even know why we stopped in the hall this time.
Yeah.
Let's talk a little bit about Santa Claus.
Hmm?
He knows when you've been naughty and he knows when you've been nice.
So, is there something you want to tell us right now?
I mean... (inhales sharply) could really help you out with the big guy.
I'm comfortable with my relationship with Santa.
- Hall.
- Hall.
Hey, do you guys want to watch a movie in my room?
Yeah, can I pick the movie?
Of course.
I just want to hang out with you guys.
Unbelievable.
Did you see how happy they are?
Of course they're happy, they just kicked our ass.
That was like a victory dinner for them.
Okay, okay, we got to regroup.
We tried bribery, we tried threats.
What's our next move?
I don't know, maybe we should just patch the hole, ground 'em all and move on.
I mean, eventually, the truth'll just slip out.
Like that Nerf dart you ate.
We cannot live in a world where holes are made and not explained.
We'll lose all credibility.
I know, I'm sorry, it's just I'm so tired.
Okay, all right.
We got to think.
Okay, um... all right.
What would happen if we pulled something like this when we were kids?
Oh.
It worked on me.
Did it?
No.
Yeah, and we're nothing to be scared of.
We're like mall cops.
Remember how we used to laugh when your brother Don's kid would act up?
(scoffs) That kid was always in trouble.
Now?
Delivering Porta-Potties.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe we can use that.
You know, give our kids a little glimpse into their future.
Scare 'em straight.
Ooh, I like it.
Yeah.
I mean, in the last day, our kids have engaged in vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.
I don't really know what that is, but they make a hell of a racket.
Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.
What you don't know is that he is also a father.
Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.
Okay, I'm trying to set a mood here.
After you hear what he has to say about his kid, you'll be begging to tell us who made the hole.
Don, go ahead, scare 'em straight.
Will do.
Mikey was just like you.
Always making holes in walls and lying about it.
Seemed like no big deal.
But where is he now?
Prison?
No.
A studio apartment in Poughkeepsie.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- That's pretty cool.
- No, no, no.
No, that's bad.
A studio apartment is just one room.
The kitchen is in the bedroom.
- Oh, it's like...
- Oh, it's one of those things... (excited chatter)
Yeah, yeah, you know, it is actually a sweet little place right next to the ballpark.
Mikey's a mascot for the minor league baseball team.
- Oh, no way.
- That's so cool.
You said he was delivering Porta-Potties.
DON:
No, no, no.
This is a new thing.
He really got his act together.
I guess it just goes to show that it doesn't matter what you do as a kid.
Sometimes your dreams come true.
- TEDDY:
Bye, Daddy.
- KATE:
Bye, Daddy.
"Bye, Daddy."
As if nothing happened.
Kindergarteners can head out to the playground.
Okay, uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Okay, it's just you and me, Butterbean.
Nobody's listening.
Why don't you tell Daddy who made the hole.
What hole?
Get out of here.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Yeah, bye.
(sighs)
Oh.
Hey, I'm glad you guys are here.
I need to talk to you.
Things no better at home?
The kids are lying.
We know they're lying.
They know we know they're lying.
It's tough to control kids these days.
Victor's in fourth grade, and I'm pretty sure he took my car out last night.
You know, a couple years ago, my wife and I decided we were gonna stop telling the girls "no,"
because it's very negative.
But then one of them bought a boat on eBay.
Now we say it all the time.
Mr. Burns, come with me, and put on your listening ears.
Okay, you don't have to talk to me
- like I'm a kindergartener.
- Now.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm about to tell you something I've never told anyone,
Please don't.
The issue you're up against with kids in today's world is that it's not a fair fight.
Yeah.
That's what I was telling Andi last night.
We can't use any of the tools our parents or teachers used on us.
So the answer I came up with is this.
See this marble jar?
Every day the kids behave,
I add a marble.
When the jar is full, they get a party.
But what they don't know is sometimes I do this.
That makes me feel so damn good.
I think maybe the kids stole some of your marbles.
My point is, Mr. Burns, is don't be afraid to fight dirty.
I see what you're getting at.
- Yeah.
- Don't touch my marbles!
I wo...
I won't.
I won't, no.
So we're really gonna do this?
Hey, Mrs. Rodriguez said to fight dirty.
Well, this is definitely dirty because I feel both excited and ashamed.
It's kind of like that time we did it on my parents' bed.
Uh, different boyfriend.
Whoops.
Okay, we'll circle back to that later.
You ready to do this?
No guts, no glory.
Okay.
Ladies and gentleman, this is your Halloween candy.
Kate, what's happening?
I think he's gonna take it away.
Oh, no, no, no.
Much worse.
I'm gonna take it away from two of you.
Mom, you're letting him do this?
Oh, absolutely.
Whoever tells us about the hole gets it all.
Every single
- piece.
- ADAM:
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so you three have a decision to make.
We'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
We got to be strong.
They're bluffing.
I'm taking the deal.
Teddy, man up!
That was incredible.
Can you see 'em?
How do they look?
Oh, they're rattled.
- I like our chances.
- Okay.
Okay, now we come to the big question.
Who wants the candy?
Here we go.
No deal.
What?
!
Okay, okay, no one's leaving unless someone confesses.
I don't even care if they're lying now.
What are we doing?
I mean, we are tearing this family apart.
And why?
Just because of-of some tiny hole in the wall?
(voice breaking):
I mean,
I just...
I can't do this anymore.
All we ever do is fight.
And it's all my fault.
(sobbing)
Okay, honey, what's happening?
(crying)
(sniffles)
Mom, don't cry.
It's my fault.
I made the hole.
(sniffles)
- It's my fault, too.
- Wh...?
I took the skateboard out of the cubby and dared him to ride it.
(sniffling)
Come on, Mom, please stop crying.
And that's how you do that.
What?
Wow.
Wait, you were faking?
No fair!
You left me no choice.
They're all yours.
Y-Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Katie, Teddy, you are grounded, uh, for two weeks.
No phones, no computers.
(groans)
Emme, you're cute.
Grab a lollipop and go play.
Well, that was a fun game.
(chuckling):
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
Eh, well, when all else fails, Mama cries.
Well, you scared me.
I almost said I made the hole.
Well, when I saw the candy thing going south,
I knew I had to pull out the big guns.
Yeah, but now you told 'em.
So we can never use it again.
No, no, no, not true.
It always works.
Because what if I'm really crying?
Yeah...
Those dopes'll fall for it every time.
Wait, have you ever used that on me?
(scoffs) No.
Hold on, hold on.
That time you cried to get me to go see the Dixie Chicks, fake or real?
Super fake.
Uh, hot air balloon ride to see the fall foliage?
Fake-a-rooney.
(gasps)
Four days at the bed-and-breakfast with no TV when the Penguins were in the play-offs?
Oh, no, no, no, babe, that was real.
Good.
(chuckling):
Okay.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
- Hey.
- Hey, hon.
Oh, remember, you need to get your suit dry-cleaned for my high school reunion this weekend.
Oh.
That's this weekend?
(sucks air through teeth)
Ooh, I don't think I can make it.
I...
Honey, you said you'd go with me.
Yeah, but that was before you told me about you and that guy in your parents' bed.
(voice breaking):
I mean, if I have to walk in there... (sniffles)
and meet that guy...
He could fall in love with you all over again.
(sniffles sharply)
(sniffles)
(sniffles loudly)
You... bringing up that guy really hurts my feelings, Adam.
I mean... (voice breaking): that was a long time ago, you know?
I mean, way before I met you.
I mean, it's not like you didn't have other girlfriends, too,
- you know?
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean... oh-oh, of course I'll go.
Told you it'd work again.
Aw!
(chuckles)
Okay, so get this.
The kids brushed their teeth and went straight to bed.
I think somebody replaced 'em with Pod People.
I mean, I'm gonna miss 'em, but I am not complaining.
You're welcome.
Oh, you're taking credit for this?
Yes, I am.

All right, bye.
Gee.
- Hey.
- Hey, how was your day?
How were the kids?
They were fantastic.
Listen to the sound... of silence.
Huh?
My one move... the perfect move... is still working.
In fact, it's so good, I named it:
The Velvet Hammer.
Um, isn't that the name of the gay bar by the ice cream shop?
It doesn't matter where the name came from.
That's what I'm calling it.
Mm-kay, well,
- good for you, honey.
- Mm-kay.
What was that?
I don't know, but it better not be fun.
Something happened in here.
It's quiet.
A little too quiet.
And empty.
A little too empty.
And that rug is on the wall.
A little too on the wall.
Are you done, Columbo?
It's so fun, though.
Oh, my God, your kids put a hole in the wall.
Okay, I need to know who made the hole, how they made the hole, and why they tried to hide the hole.
What hole?
The hole in the wall.
You mean, like, the window?
N-No, no.
I mean like that.
Whoa, where did that come from?
You know, I-I think that's always been there.
Maybe we have a mouse.
Um... can I see you in the kitchen?
No!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
Are you?
Okay, you three stay put.
Will you get me a Go-Gurt from the fridge?
What fridge?
See?
Two can play at that game.
What game?
What is going on in there?
Have they ever stonewalled you like that before?
Well, yeah, a few times, but I always had a move.
What was it?
"Wait until your father gets home."
I'm already home.
Yes, that's why we're in the kitchen.
I can't believe they formed an alliance.
Well... it's actually kind of sweet.
I mean, I am always telling them to stick together.
Who knew it would backfire?
Parenting's hard.
Okay, okay, okay.
Hold on.
If they're sticking together, we got to split 'em up, right?
Yes.
And make them understand it's in their best interest to be on our team.
So what are we gonna use, threats or bribes?
Uh, well, threats are free.
Let's start with those.
Good.
Oh, look,
Katie's trophy from when her volleyball team
- won regional's.
- Hmm.
Our girl really does love her volleyball,
- doesn't she?
- Mmm.
What are you guys doing?
You, uh, you have a volleyball camp coming up, don't you?
Yeah.
Boy, I'd hate for you to get grounded and miss it, just because of some stupid hole in the wall.
I don't want to miss my camp.
Here we go.
I mean, if I don't go to camp,
I'd feel bad for you guys.
Um, what's that?
That's the weekend Teddy and Emme are supposed to stay at Grandma and Grandpa's.
You guys are gonna have the whole house to yourself.
Oh, well.
Can I see you in the hall?
Mm-hmm.
We are getting our weekend alone.
I don't care if they burn the house down.
And we never should have started with Katie, that was a rookie mistake.
You're right.
She's too smart.
We need to go to the dumb one.
Hey, hey.
I don't think any of our kids are dumb.
But I will follow you to Teddy's room.
Boy, is this room crowded.
You know, if you had Katie's room, you'd have space to set up all your toys.
But, you said Kate gets the bigger room because she's older.
Ah, she's had her time.
Tell us who made the hole, the room is yours.
Kate said I shouldn't answer any questions without representation.
He's trying to lawyer up.
Wait, where did you learn the word "representation"?
Kate wrote it on my hand.
Are you gonna talk or not?
No.
- Can I see you in the hallway?
- Mm-hmm.
That boy has learned more in an hour with Katie, than he has in five years of school.
What now?
We've only got one kid left.
I don't even know why we stopped in the hall this time.
Yeah.
Let's talk a little bit about Santa Claus.
Hmm?
He knows when you've been naughty and he knows when you've been nice.
So, is there something you want to tell us right now?
I mean... could really help you out with the big guy.
I'm comfortable with my relationship with Santa.
- Hall.
- Hall.
Hey, do you guys want to watch a movie in my room?
Yeah, can I pick the movie?
Of course.
I just want to hang out with you guys.
Unbelievable.
Did you see how happy they are?
Of course they're happy, they just kicked our ass.
That was like a victory dinner for them.
Okay, okay, we got to regroup.
We tried bribery, we tried threats.
What's our next move?
I don't know, maybe we should just patch the hole, ground 'em all and move on.
I mean, eventually, the truth'll just slip out.
Like that Nerf dart you ate.
We cannot live in a world where holes are made and not explained.
We'll lose all credibility.
I know, I'm sorry, it's just I'm so tired.
Okay, all right.
We got to think.
Okay, um... all right.
What would happen if we pulled something like this when we were kids?
Oh.
It worked on me.
Did it?
No.
Yeah, and we're nothing to be scared of.
We're like mall cops.
Remember how we used to laugh when your brother Don's kid would act up?
That kid was always in trouble.
Now?
Delivering Porta-Potties.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe we can use that.
You know, give our kids a little glimpse into their future.
Scare 'em straight.
Ooh, I like it.
Yeah.
I mean, in the last day, our kids have engaged in vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.
I don't really know what that is, but they make a hell of a racket.
Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.
What you don't know is that he is also a father.
Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.
Okay, I'm trying to set a mood here.
After you hear what he has to say about his kid, you'll be begging to tell us who made the hole.
Don, go ahead, scare 'em straight.
Will do.
Mikey was just like you.
Always making holes in walls and lying about it.
Seemed like no big deal.
But where is he now?
Prison?
No.
A studio apartment in Poughkeepsie.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- That's pretty cool.
- No, no, no.
No, that's bad.
A studio apartment is just one room.
The kitchen is in the bedroom.
- Oh, it's like...
- Oh, it's one of those things...
Yeah, yeah, you know, it is actually a sweet little place right next to the ballpark.
Mikey's a mascot for the minor league baseball team.
- Oh, no way.
- That's so cool.
You said he was delivering Porta-Potties.
No, no, no.
This is a new thing.
He really got his act together.
I guess it just goes to show that it doesn't matter what you do as a kid.
Sometimes your dreams come true.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy.
"Bye, Daddy."
As if nothing happened.
Kindergarteners can head out to the playground.
Okay, uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Okay, it's just you and me, Butterbean.
Nobody's listening.
Why don't you tell Daddy who made the hole.
What hole?
Get out of here.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Yeah, bye.
Oh.
Hey, I'm glad you guys are here.
I need to talk to you.
Things no better at home?
The kids are lying.
We know they're lying.
They know we know they're lying.
It's tough to control kids these days.
Victor's in fourth grade, and I'm pretty sure he took my car out last night.
You know, a couple years ago, my wife and I decided we were gonna stop telling the girls "no,"
because it's very negative.
But then one of them bought a boat on eBay.
Now we say it all the time.
Mr. Burns, come with me, and put on your listening ears.
Okay, you don't have to talk to me
- like I'm a kindergartener.
- Now.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm about to tell you something I've never told anyone,
Please don't.
The issue you're up against with kids in today's world is that it's not a fair fight.
Yeah.
That's what I was telling Andi last night.
We can't use any of the tools our parents or teachers used on us.
So the answer I came up with is this.
See this marble jar?
Every day the kids behave,
I add a marble.
When the jar is full, they get a party.
But what they don't know is sometimes I do this.
That makes me feel so damn good.
I think maybe the kids stole some of your marbles.
My point is, Mr. Burns, is don't be afraid to fight dirty.
I see what you're getting at.
- Yeah.
- Don't touch my marbles!
I wo...
I won't.
I won't, no.
So we're really gonna do this?
Hey, Mrs. Rodriguez said to fight dirty.
Well, this is definitely dirty because I feel both excited and ashamed.
It's kind of like that time we did it on my parents' bed.
Uh, different boyfriend.
Whoops.
Okay, we'll circle back to that later.
You ready to do this?
No guts, no glory.
Okay.
Ladies and gentleman, this is your Halloween candy.
Kate, what's happening?
I think he's gonna take it away.
Oh, no, no, no.
Much worse.
I'm gonna take it away from two of you.
Mom, you're letting him do this?
Oh, absolutely.
Whoever tells us about the hole gets it all.
Every single
- piece.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, so you three have a decision to make.
We'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
We got to be strong.
They're bluffing.
I'm taking the deal.
Teddy, man up!
That was incredible.
Can you see 'em?
How do they look?
Oh, they're rattled.
- I like our chances.
- Okay.
Okay, now we come to the big question.
Who wants the candy?
Here we go.
No deal.
What?
!
Okay, okay, no one's leaving unless someone confesses.
I don't even care if they're lying now.
What are we doing?
I mean, we are tearing this family apart.
And why?
Just because of-of some tiny hole in the wall?
I mean,
I just...
I can't do this anymore.
All we ever do is fight.
And it's all my fault.
Okay, honey, what's happening?
Mom, don't cry.
It's my fault.
I made the hole.
- It's my fault, too.
- Wh...?
I took the skateboard out of the cubby and dared him to ride it.
Come on, Mom, please stop crying.
And that's how you do that.
What?
Wow.
Wait, you were faking?
No fair!
You left me no choice.
They're all yours.
Y-Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Katie, Teddy, you are grounded, uh, for two weeks.
No phones, no computers.
Emme, you're cute.
Grab a lollipop and go play.
Well, that was a fun game.
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
Eh, well, when all else fails, Mama cries.
Well, you scared me.
I almost said I made the hole.
Well, when I saw the candy thing going south,
I knew I had to pull out the big guns.
Yeah, but now you told 'em.
So we can never use it again.
No, no, no, not true.
It always works.
Because what if I'm really crying?
Yeah...
Those dopes'll fall for it every time.
Wait, have you ever used that on me?
No.
Hold on, hold on.
That time you cried to get me to go see the Dixie Chicks, fake or real?
Super fake.
Uh, hot air balloon ride to see the fall foliage?
Fake-a-rooney.
Four days at the bed-and-breakfast with no TV when the Penguins were in the play-offs?
Oh, no, no, no, babe, that was real.
Good.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, hon.
Oh, remember, you need to get your suit dry-cleaned for my high school reunion this weekend.
Oh.
That's this weekend?
Ooh, I don't think I can make it.
I...
Honey, you said you'd go with me.
Yeah, but that was before you told me about you and that guy in your parents' bed.
I mean, if I have to walk in there... and meet that guy...
He could fall in love with you all over again.
You... bringing up that guy really hurts my feelings, Adam.
I mean... that was a long time ago, you know?
I mean, way before I met you.
I mean, it's not like you didn't have other girlfriends, too,
- you know?
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean... oh-oh, of course I'll go.
Told you it'd work again.
Aw!
When I got there, they had the scene very well secured.
They had the entire block taped off.
Front door wide open, little music playing in the background, candles are lit inside.
Very violent confrontation.
Rage.
Two victims, blood everywhere.
We find a glove...
It's a left glove... and a blood trail indicating the suspect has been wounded on the left side.
So we're just getting into this when we find out that this is apparently OJ Simpson's estranged wife.
We have two children asleep.
I have a very brutal murder.
Someone's gotta make a death notification of next of kin.
Which is Simpson.
Lang and Vannatter were talking and they called me over and said,
"You were at Simpson's house once, right?
We want you to take us up there."
We pull close to the gate.
Vannatter was hitting the doorbell, they keep ringing the doorbell and so I just stroll down the street.
By the other gate, there's a white Bronco.
On the driver's side door handle, blood.
I mean there was enough evidence outside, we gotta make sure everybody's okay in here.
Oh God, what are we going to do, Simpson's in there dead.
Well, yeah, we need to go in.
So I jumped up over the fence and I opened the gate.
Bang on the front door, nothing.
Walk around to the back, there's a couple of bungalows.
The first one was Kato Kaelin's.
Kato Kaelin was a live-in friend.
We say to the police, "Check on Mr. Simpson."
OJ's in Chicago.
Well, he left last night.
Oh, thank God.
They all leave and I'm left here with Kato Kaelin.
I go "Tell me what you did last night."
He goes, "Well I was talking on the phone and all a sudden there was, like, an earthquake.
It was just like on the wall and pictures shook."
Okay.
I walk back outside and I start walking down the back, behind the bungalows.
And then as I pan down,
I see this brown, glistening...
At first I thought it was dog crap.
And then I shined a light on it.
It's a glove.
Just like the one...
Ed Bundy...
Uh, yeah, this is gonna get deep.
This is gonna be a crime scene.
I make the decision to make a telephonic to the Brown family and I talk to Lou Brown and say that your daughter Nicole is dead.
It's quiet for about two seconds then all this screaming.
It's Nicole's sister, Denise.
"I knew that motherfucker, he was gonna kill,
I knew he was gonna do this."
I mean, she didn't hesitate.
Nobody comes unglued like that unless they have a strong suspicion.
We gotta look at it a little differently now.
We lock everything down, no more searching, can't do anything until we get a warrant.
Phil Vannatter called me and said,
"I've got some information;
I need to get a search warrant.
I need you to tell me if you think it sounds okay."
And he just summarized the evidence and it was huge.
Okay, yeah, go ahead, get the search warrant, you're fine.
And he said, "You know who it is?
It's OJ Simpson."
OJ Simpson?
Um...
I was never into sports, so I didn't even know what game he played.
I thought he was a has-been.
Monday afternoon came around,
Simpson came back from Chicago and they handcuff him.
It was quite surprising.
Your ex-husband's always a suspect in a case.
Okay, wow.
Here we go.
He said he's gonna talk to us, which is really strange.
You have one opportunity forever to talk to this guy, forever.
He's thinking he can control a couple of cops.
Especially these guys 'cause, you know, they're pretty nice.
What Vannatter and Lang failed to do was simply to pin him down on what he did on the day of the murder.
OJ just rambled and created an interview transcript that was useless to the prosecution.
What do you mean, you were running around doing what you do?
What do you mean?
What do you mean you cut yourself in Chicago but the blood got on the Bronco before you left.
What do you mean?
There's a million things that they just let go.
Yeah, uh huh, yeah, uh huh.
Oh my God.
What I wanted was his blood, photographs taken of the bleeding finger, I wanted his fingerprints now that we've got his cooperation.
We get the blood, we get all these things we want which are going to be evidence.
And then, ya know, he's released.
What?
Why would you do that?
If he was any other guy, would you have let him go?
And they said, "Where can he go?
After all, what can he do?"
I mean, everybody recognizes him.
When I went over to Rockingham, he had like three TV's and each and every one of them, he had a different channel on.
Suspect, what are you talking about?
Is he crazy?
And I said, "OJ, what happened to your finger?"
And he says, "I cut it on a glass in Chicago."
And I went oh, okay.
Somebody else sat down and asked him the same question and he said, "I was chipping golf balls."
And I went, uh-hmm, later on that evening, same question came out, "Oh man, I was getting the cell phone out of the Bronco, cut myself."
I was like, wow.
I tried to leave there and OJ goes, "Shipp, hold on."
and he says, "They asked me to take a lie detector test.
I told them no."
I said, "What do you mean, you told them no?"
And he says, you know, jokingly, he says
"Well, you know to be truthful, Shipp,
I have had dreams of killing her."
I wanted to leave.
I said, "I'm outta here."
Here, at OJ Simpson's home, in the fashionable suburb of Brentwood, the world media has settled in to the siege.
Against the public backdrop, police are quietly, methodically reconstructing the events of last Sunday evening to answer the question:
Could this American sports hero, possibly, be a murderer?
At the time that this murder took place,
OJ was at home, awaiting a limousine to take him to the airport for a promotional event in Chicago.
OJ Simpson has described him as his quarterback.
He is defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
I agree with that assessment.
He was known as the fixer.
He was a Hollywood lawyer.
He was not know as a "trial dogg" with two G's.
You hired Bob Shapiro to cut a deal.
Bob had never tried a murder case.
And so when he called me in June and said, "I need some help in the OJ case."
I was more than ready.
Well, I worked for Bob Shapiro on some of his other cases and I was pretty successful.
So they recruited me as the defense investigator.
OJ was putting together his team.
They sent a guy over to me.
"Hey man, we're putting together this thing."
"We're going to need you, OJ needs you."
And I said, "I'm not on board."
And I'll never forget that investigator's look on his face.
He said, "What?"
I said, "OJ killed her, I'm not on board."
I gotta say, I have a lot of fun with her.
At times, I felt like a big brother to her 'cause
I'd come over there and she'd share things with me.
And I kinda felt special that she thought enough of me to tell me her problems.
She's a great human being.
Thank you.
I remember early in... in the years that her and OJ was dating, we were all down in the Caribbean.
OJ was working on a film, and if a lot of don't know, I'm gonna let you know now, blacks can not swim, we can't float.
Justin can.
Well, thank God, well he got that from his mom.
So, we're out in the saltwater, right?
And Nicole is out there looking like, you know, she was made to swim, she's backstroking and she's doing all these things.
So, here's OJ and I, we're standing on the shore and she's waving us in.
Now, this is saltwater, in the Caribbean.
Everything down there floats.
OJ and I got out there and we tried to float, and she thought that's the funniest thing she'd ever seen in her life.
She could not believe it.
And one of the things about Nicole, which all of you will agree, was Nicole's laugh.
Once that woman laughed, she was, uh...
She brought out a lot of goodness in you.
Nicole was very, very special to me.
That was my buddy.
And, um...
And I know, Sydney and Justin, you've been blessed because of a lot of her character and the goodness about her.
You're not going to notice it now, but you're going to notice it as you get older cause she's laid a great foundation for you two.
I love you, Nicole, and I love you too, Jason.
I mean Justin and Sydney and I'll always will be there for you.
OJ Simpson may soon face legal action.
The Associated Press says a homicide detective has told them Simpson's arrest is imminent.
It is not only OJ Simpson's life that is coming under the media microscope.
Reporters are looking, too, at Ronald Goldman, the aspiring model, who was killed with Nicole Simpson.
His family said he was nothing more than a friend.
He was a special human being that didn't deserve what's happened.
He was gonna open a restaurant.
After Ron was murdered, we went to his apartment.
He had a floor plan, he had a menu, he had names of people whose art he was gonna hang on the wall.
He had everything worked out.
Obviously, this is your older brother.
We don't get to spend very much time together, so I'm very glad that I was able to be here.
So I love you very much and I'll see you soon.
That was all taken away.
My sister's body was gonna be behind closed doors.
I said to my friend, "I can't go in there."
And as I'm having this conversation with them I'm hearing screams.
Looking at her I can remember a black dress up to her neck because
what I had heard is that her head was almost cut off all the way.
Which even shocked me more and more.
I mean that was just like... and seeing her there, lying there in a coffin.
I mean, it really, I mean,
I don't know, it's just terrible.
He came to the wake.
It was just unbelievable.
We were all kind of in shock that he came there.
Judy asked him directly, did you kill my daughter?
No, no.
I loved her too much.
He was, like, on Xanax or something.
He was just sedated.
I leaned over to him and said,
"We're going to get through this."
I had no idea what was going on.
Action News has learned that Simpson's attorney is working on a deal with police for Simpson's surrender to avoid what the lawyer calls, and we quote, "a media circus."
Shapiro was going to surrender him to the detectives in the morning.
We're standing outside Parker Center waiting for OJ to turn himself in.
Every time a car would pass by, is that OJ?
I think it was 11:00.
Oh, no, he doesn't show up.
I think I'd already scheduled a press conference.
And it's like, oh, no.
We potentially could look like a bunch of clowns here.
I did not know about the arrangements for his surrender.
I went with the assumption that they would announce that he had been arrested.
Gascon's coming up.
Looking out at the auditorium, not only are all the seats taken, but all the aisles are jammed, the front is jammed, the back wall is jammed.
He's on the stage.
And I was the one who was gonna have to stand out there naked.
This morning detectives for the Los Angeles
Police Department sought and obtained a warrant for the arrest of OJ Simpson, charging him with the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman.
Mr. Simpson, in agreement with his attorney, was scheduled to surrender this morning, to the Los Angeles Police Department.
Initially, that was 11:00.
It then became 11:45.
Mr. Simpson has not appeared.
The Los Angeles Police Department, right now, is actively searching for Mr. Simpson.
The gasp that went through the room,
I think it's right at that moment, that I realized, oh boy, this is big.
We will continue our pursuit of Mr. Simpson and hope to have him in custody soon.
He's gone.
I looked at Marika and said,
"It's a helicopter story now.
Let's find this son of a bitch."
I can take a few questions.
I'd known Gascon for a long time and he's a fairly easygoing guy normally.
You're gonna have to hold it down.
One at a time or won't be able to hear you.
Then a sense of humor to add a light touch.
You asked a question, would you like for me to answer?
He got pretty tightly wound that day.
I doubt that there's anyone around this country that's been monitoring television, radio, or newspapers, that doesn't know at this point that something's going on in this case.
If you, in any way, are assisting Mr. Simpson in avoiding justice, Mr. Simpson is a fugitive of justice right now.
And If you assist him in any way, you are committing a felony.
I was pissed off that we were in essence given the old Italian gesture.
I don't recall being that upset before in the DA's office.
I'm angry, I'm not embarrassed.
Angry at who, beyond...
I'm angry at OJ Simpson.
It is not an escape, he was not under arrest.
He was under sedation in a very very emotional state.
He was at a residence that is secluded, that is very, very hard to find, and there was never any thought of him leaving that residence without us.
This letter was written by OJ today.
First, everyone understand,
I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder.
I loved her, always have, and always will.
If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much.
It's 1700, 5 pm, when you have
Karsashian reading the letter.
I thought, wow, maybe he killed himself.
I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things, so why do I end up like this?
I can't go on.
No matter what the outcome, people will look and point.
I can't take that.
I can't subject my children to that.
We deal with folks who are in crisis and get to a very dark place and they just do it.
Don't feel sorry for me.
I've had a great life.
Great friends.
Please think of the real OJ and not this lost person.
The note says, to me, feel sorry for me but...
I'm the guy, you know, I'm the bad guy.
He was, Mr. Cawlings was with him, he was his best friend, he was by his side for the last few minutes alone while we were upstairs.
AC just had a love for OJ.
I remember once, in high school, a friend of mine had a starter pistol that he brought to school.
So we said okay, let's go, take the gun and pull it on OJ and act like we're gonna shoot him.
We were all down for it.
So, we went out on the field where OJ and Al were and my friend, Ray, well, he pulled the gun out and everybody sorta stepped back.
And Al Cowlings stepped in front of OJ.
And said, "Ray, if you gonna shoot OJ, you gotta shoot me first."
1993 Ford Bronco.
We're listening to the Los Angeles Police Department and they believe that this vehicle is somewhere in the vicinity of the El Toro Y.
And I look down below and there's the El Toro Y.
And there's a white Bronco.
Then there's a sheriff's unit and there's another sheriff's unit and another sheriff's unit.
Okay, here we are, open the door.
We get the door open and we get our very first shot.
And I'm back on the two way radio telling CBS, you gotta get us on the air, we found him.
And with a flip of the switch, we were on with Dan Rather.
This is Dan Rather with Connie Chung in Los Angeles and let's hold on a second here.
I'm seeing on the monitor this live helicopter coverage of the Ford Bronco being followed by the police.
And let's pick up some of the transmission from the helicopter.
They believe he's suicidal and very dangerous.
Unfortunately at this time it does not appear as though the driver is slowing down or complying with the orders of the officers.
We were on the air exclusively for 22 minutes.
And this was the most conflicted I had every been.
The gravity of the murder, I mean, this was a double homicide and this is a tragic story.
Very few human beings fall as far as OJ Simpson.
I've fallen quite a bit transitioning, you know, you go from being like a hero pilot to some tranny, you know, so I've fallen somewhat myself but this is like an epic fall.
And I'm weighing consequences of this with also the biggest news story, like, ever.
I'm going to use a pair of binoculars to try to determine whether or not I can see Mr. Simpson.
Fuck NBC, fuck ABC, fuck those guys.
I hope they shoot this son of a bitch.
And I hope they kill him before the competitors get here.
911, what are you reporting?
This is AC.
I have OJ in the car.
Okay, where are you?
Please, I'm coming up the 5 freeway.
Okay.
Right now we are okay.
But you got to tell the police to back off.
He's still alive, but he's got a gun to his head.
Okay, hold on a minute, Monica.
He just wants to see his mother.
Let me get him to the house.
Okay, hold on a moment.
Okay, what's your name?
My name is AC.
You know who I am, God dammit.
Okay.
Right now, that OJ's sitting there is the passenger seat with a gun pointed at his own head.
Someone turned the TV on and there he is.
14 units of the Orange County Sheriff's
Department and Highway Patrol following behind a good distance.
Oh my God, this isn't real, this can't be real.
We're dumbfounded.
Law enforcement is following Simpson.
They want him to stop.
Red lights and sirens.
It's not an escort.
Why are they allowing him to continue?
Really, the game plan is really being conducted by Mr. Simpson at this point and it's very much like when the president travels down a major thoroughfare, like a freeway.
I was wondering, okay, maybe around the next curve they've got it marked off and they're going to force him to stop.
It wasn't like they were going 100 miles an hour.
But I'm not a police tactician.
That was their call.
I've covered so many of these things, this was not usual police behavior.
If OJ Simpson were black, that shit wouldn't have happened.
He'd be on the ground getting clubbed.
But since he transcended race and color to the exalted status of celebrity, he got a motorcade.
This is not a chase, this is basically an accompaniment.
Nobody is doing anything.
So I'm talking to Eddie Jo Fairbanks in the DA's office.
She said, "Well, I just happen to have his cell number, would you like it?
You there?
Just let me get to my house.
Okay, we're gonna do that.
I swear to you I'll give you,
I'll give you me, I'll give you my whole body.
Okay...
I just need to get to my house.
Okay, we're gonna do that, just throw the gun out the window.
I can't do that.
We're not gonna bother you, we're gonna let you go up there.
Just throw it out this window, please, you're scaring everybody.
This is not to keep you guys away from me, this is for me.
I know that, nobody's gonna hurt you.
This is for me.
He's trying, in my mind, to imply he's going to commit suicide, but he's not saying that.
So, I'm playing along with that.
Hey, everybody loves you, don't do this.
Just throw it out the window and nobody's gonna get hurt.
You've got a guy here that's,
I don't know where his mind is,
I really believe he killed two people.
But now he's got a loaded gun, and he's being chased by cops.
Is he gonna start shooting at the cops?
Is he gonna shoot at AC and kill...
Is he gonna blow his own brains out?
I do know if I can engage him in a conversation it's going to temporarily at least take his mind off the gun.
I'm the only one that deserves this.
No, you're don't deserve that.
You do not deserve to get hurt.
Don't do this.
All I did was love Nicole.
All I did was love her.
I understand.
Love everybody, show everybody my whole life and I love everybody.
We know that and everybody loves you.
Your kids need you.
I've already said goodbye to my kids.
You're gonna hurt everybody.
I'm just gonna have to see.
No, don't
I'm gonna go with Nicole.
That's all I'm gonna do.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Think about everybody else, alright?
I couldn't on the freeway.
I couldn't do it in a field.
I want to do it at her grave.
I want to do it at my house.
You gonna go to the house?
We were told he was going to the Rockingham location.
And that's all we were told.
If they requested SWAT to handle something, that's because they can't handle it themselves.
I was told you're going to do the talking, you're going to be the negotiator.
Drive time from downtown to the west side was gonna take 30, 40 minutes.
We were trying to beat him.
They were pressuring us.
He's pretty close.
We were estimating we were about 10 minutes ahead.
The last thing we want is for him to get there before us.
Because now we're going to lose control.
And we're on the freeway and all the overpasses, there were people already staged.
Signs, free OJ, we love you OJ,
What a bunch of losers.
I think people realized, hey, this is gonna be passing my neighborhood.
And they wanted to see OJ's last run.
This was not a somber event.
This was one of Los Angeles's largest parties.
This was lined with people.
And they're running full speed down the street, trying to get to the location.
We're not used to seeing those types of crowds rush in.
OJ!
OJ!
OJ!
OJ!
District Attorney of Los Angeles,
Mr. Gil Garcetti, will the fact that he has fled make things worse for him?
Any time you have an accused who leaves, that and the fact, we believe, shows a consciousness of guilt.
I think earlier in the week, all of us close to OJ didn't believe that he had been involved in this.
And now I think there's a sense of resignation and has been for the last 24 hours and we can't believe what's happening and there was nothing ever, ever in the past that would indicate that OJ would be capable of doing what he's doing right now.
Did they let you go?
They didn't say anything, all of a sudden, they just...
What was that?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, CBS is trying to get you in.
Now, he's pulling off now, they've just pulled off a main highway.
Judy Mullard, help us here.
I can't tell ya, looks like
Santa Monica Freeway, heading I can't tell ya yet.
Look at all these people rushing up to the corner.
No, it's an exit.
This word has obviously spread
Judy, hang on, look at all these people rushing, waving...
There is an absolutely utterly macabe nature to all this.
They've been cheering him on, yelling go Juice go.
Cheering him on,
He pulled off at Sunset, off the 405, he's on his way back toward Brentwood.
When I got on scene there, I walked toward the residence, there was family inside the residence and they were eating.
Looked like they had like a sandwich buffet that they were doing and they were watching tv.
Dining.
I use that clinical term.
Nutty.
Both sides of the street have pedestrians, he just passed us at Barrington.
Okay, Eric, its only now probably three minutes at the most I would say to his home in Brentwood.
They're passing the church installed there.
They are heading right into Brentwood now.
He's heading to my house.
He's making a right turn, I assume, that's up into Brentwood Park, and appears to be on the way to either his home or very close to his home.
We closed the gate on Rockingham, we left this one open to force him through and make him come into where we wanted him.
There was a sniper team in this house across the street, there's a sniper team on top of the roof at the residence.
And there was one across the street.
Use your own discretion.
You take him down if you have to.
When'd you see the kids last, Juice?
He's pulling up in my driveway.
I know, I see you, I see you.
Please, toss the gun.
Juice, just toss it.
He's pulling into his house, oh shit.
I've never seen anything like this.
Mr. Simpson, OJ please.
When we're standing in the threshold there, to my right is a television so, when the Bronco pulls into the driveway
I see Bronco, Cawlings, Simpson in the backseat and then I look right here and I get the point of view that you're seeing.
Oh my goodness gracious.
He's come home after all of that.
Just as we're trying to get words out, a young man runs up to the driver's side of the door and starts hitting at AC Cawlings.
Who is that out there?
He's just trying to help.
He's just trying to help, man.
Kardashian said, "That's Jason Simpson, That's OJ's son."
So, I told Pepabrick, I said, "Go out there and get him."
Moved him out, now we get down to the business that we designed.
In this juncture, it's very fragile.
What exacerbates, what makes it crazy, is the noise, you had a helicopter seemed like about 50 feet off the deck, every car that was in the following had their red lights and sirens on.
If you just take a snapshot, you'd go, this is madness, absolute madness.
I watched that from the newsroom and when I saw a couple of the SWAT officers that I recognized run across the shot, I thought, oh my God, they're gonna kill him in the driveway.
Just toss it please.
Alright?
Juice, just toss the gun.
I did not want him to get out of the car with a gun in his hand, they'd have dumped him, they would not have had a choice.
Juice, come on, Juice.
They resolve most situations peacefully, but they are there to finish it one way or another.
OJ, no, no OJ.
Don't, no man, don't.
Juice, don't do it, Juice.
Pick it up.
I'm thinking, okay, there are a lot of people that are betting on us.
That we're going to screw this up.
That are cynical.
That believe that we are a brutal horrible organization.
And it's just not the case.
How do they know, that the police and the DA didn't make all this evidence up, to make him act the way that he's acting?
We were recovering from Rodney King and it's so important for the people to see things that go the right way.
There is so much on the news where things go the wrong way.
Normally, that would be on my mind, but that night it wasn't.
Doors opening.
That is Al Cawlings.
He's quite, quite upset at the moment.
Yeah.
Quite emotional here.
I've got to get Cawlings out.
As much as he was trying to help, he was interfering in where I needed to do.
I needed to speak directly to Mr. Simpson, to try and keep him from hurting himself.
And Mr. Cawlings was trying to be a go between.
He was very worried about his friend.
He kept asking us, please don't hurt him, please don't hurt him, please.
And he wanted to go back, he wanted to stay with his friend.
And we wouldn't allow it, we can't.
Police haven't made a move, we understand negotiations are still going on.
Simpson, you can see him, cradling what looks like framed photos, but clearly he has the barrel of a weapon under his chin and it looks like he's just resting his chin on the barrel of the weapon.
It was the look of a defeated man.
They are, according to police scanners, talking to OJ on the phone, from the inside the house, trying to negotiate something.
I said to him very early on,
I don't think your children need to see another tragedy.
And he immediately changed the subject right to about himself, he wouldn't even speak to that.
I said I know where he's coming from.
There was so much memorabilia and stuff of him everywhere, normally you would see other photos of family members or something else, you didn't see those things, it was all him.
I told Mike Albanis, Mike, I can talk him into it.
We can appeal to his ego enough that he's going to come out for us.
His voice, in the beginning, was excited but then it called down.
The more we spoke about him, the more he liked it.
We want to show them that you're still the person you have been all these years.
This great football player, this great everything.
He asked me to come out to the car, and I said, "No, you're going to show them yourself, you're going to show them just how big and courageous you are, you're going to walk to me and you're
going to leave the gun in the car, you're going to walk out and show everyone, right now.
You're going to do this."
My personal spin, I think, he wanted to surrender when it was dark.
So that he wouldn't be seen.
Night has fallen here over Brentwood.
He had two picture frames that were cradled in his arms.
We told him, open the door, put your arm out with the frame, and the other arm out with the framed photo, so it's clear to everybody, so there was no mistaking.
Doors open, dome lights on, he's out of the vehicle.
Kinda just hunches over, shuffles six eight steps to us, and collapses in our arms.
He goes, "I'm sorry,
I was never going to hurt you guys.
I'm sorry.
I was never going to hurt you guys."
OJ's in custody.
We understand that OJ's in custody.
They're calling a code four.
All clear, all safe.
Thank you, thank you to God.
Unbelievable, we saw an incredible situation that's gone on for hours.
Incredible restraint by the Los Angeles Police Department.
The officer's kept their distance.
They allowed the SWAT team, the pros, to come in, they took their positions.
He'd asked me to stay with him throughout the process.
I promised him I would stay with him.
I said it's time, I gotta handcuff you now, you need to be handcuffed.
I'm sorry this is the way it works.
As we take off, Simpson is amazed at the crowds.
He just couldn't believe there was this many people there.
Free OJ, Free OJ!
And he said, "what are all these niggers doing in Brentwood?"
I walk outside and Shapiro's there.
Shapiro shakes my hand, he says,
"Thank you for not killing OJ Simpson."
He grabbed me and went to hug me.
I go, let's just,
I wasn't in the mood for a hug and maybe I wasn't professional.
I don't know the frickin guy, right, and he wants to weep on me?
Well this is nutty did.
It really is.
I said, I have seen everything in law enforcement.
There is nothing else that can top this.
Later today in Los Angeles, OJ Simpson is expected to make his first court appearance.
OJ has been in jail, under a suicide watch, visited only by a psychiatrist and his lawyer.
Please,
Alright, people.
Please speak up so you may be heard.
Uh, yes.
Pardon me, I'm sorry.
May we start all over again?
Yes.
He looked a mess.
He looked like someone who had committed murder.
There was nothing about the old smiling Simpson, about him that day.
Your charges for this complaint in that you willfully and unlawfully with pronounced forethought murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.
In count two your charge is the crime of murder in violation of penal code section 187.
That you willfully and unlawfully with pronounced forethought murder of Ronald Lyle Goldman.
When he initially entered the plea, he barely choked it out.
Not guilty.
Alright, then, the not guilty plea will be entered, the case will be set for a preliminary hearing within the statutory period.
Recess.
This case will be handled as every case is handled, the case will be thoroughly investigated by top notch investigators, we will present the prosecution in a thorough and professional manner.
I amongst others, recommended her.
I was aware of her successes in the court room.
I knew she was a very dynamic trial lawyer.
I want no one to forget the fact that
Robert Barto wakes up every morning, and Rebecca Schaeffer lies buried in a grave in Oregon.
Worked extraordinarily hard, she was very facile with trace evidence, hair, fiber, and the like.
She was up to speed on DNA.
She was one of our best trial lawyers.
I think that with all the questions that we've been getting about the public sympathy for Mr. Simpson, we should not forget the fact that we have two victims, that were brutally slain.
I have to say, it never mattered to me who the defendant was, it was a question of who did it.
Whether their famous, whether their not famous.
They all get the same treatment.
You are looking at inmate number 4103970, OJ Simpson.
I believed he was innocent.
I was like everybody else, it was incomprehensible that my friend could do this.
I snuck into the jail to see him and there's this guy that was my buddy and
he looked emaciated, he was in an orange jumpsuit, and he was shackled to the desk in front of me.
Then he looked at me on the other side of plexiglasses, close as he could be, and he said,
"I swear to God, I didn't do this."
I believed him.
He asked me if I kind of would be the chronicler of the whole thing.
Would I write a book about the whole thing.
I backed away from that.
Then, in a moment of ultimate surrealism,
I'm sitting with OJ and Lyle Menendez walks behind him.
And I just went, shit, this is more than my little pea brain can handle.
Bob, OJ Simpson is in a Los Angeles jail cell tonight.
His attorney says he spoke to him today and that Simpson was in tears.
Now, Cawlings, was himself, arrested on a felony charge of aiding a fugitive.
Get away from my fucking house.
Simpson, had $10,000 in cash and a passport at that point.
I love OJ no matter what happens.
The murder with special circumstances, death penalty charges.
The final DNA tests are positive for intense and purposes, OJ Simpson really has no option but to admit that he killed.
The man who will lead the prosecution of the case, against OJ Simpson, is Los Angeles District Attorney, Gil Garcetti.
You said earlier, "It's not going to shock me if we see OJ Simpson sometime down the road say okay
I did do it but I'm not responsible."
That certainly sounded, to me, like a prosecutor very comfortable with his case.
I am comfortable with the case,
I don't mean to speculate as to what the defense is going to be but I have been a prosecutor for 25 years.
The evidence was so overwhelming, there was just no doubt.
A blood trail that led from Bundy all the way into his bedroom.
I don't think I'd ever seen that much evidence in any single case ever.
When you couple that with evidence of motivation, and that was the history of domestic violence, with Simpson physically and psychologically abusing Nicole Brown.
This is my woman.
This was a domestic violence case that culminated in murder.
End of story.
Both sides are going to try to place the publicity thier way but because this is a major celebrity, probably this is the most famous
American ever charged with murder, there will not business as usual.
My former criminal law professor, Alan Dershowitz, was part of what would later become known as the dream team,
OJ Simpson's lawyers.
So, I called up Alan, and I said,
"You know, what do you think of this case?"
And he said, "I don't know, but you ought to look into this guy, this cop.
Mark Fuhrman, there's something bad about him."
I first met Mark during the execution of a second search warrant.
I was impressed, he seemed to have an eye for detail.
Some of his investigative moves, particularly going up to Rockingham, struck me as this is a smart detective.
Mark Fuhrman, M-A-R-K F-U-H-R-M-A-N.
When he testified at the preliminary hearing, he did a really good job.
Blood to the left of the footprint would indicate that the person that left the scene was bleeding from the left side of his body.
And the spot on the Bronco would coincide with that injury.
He was on top of his game.
His memory of the search of
Rockingham was the primary thing.
And it was detailed and consistent.
And why was it that you did not secure the residence for a search warrant before finding the glove.
This is not a situation where we had the time to stand out in the street and just wait and wonder.
We had to do something.
I thought maybe this guy Fuhrman has done something wrong.
Maybe, he's been sued.
There was this dungeon like basement in downtown Los Angeles with all the records of civil court filings.
And I started burrowing through these records looking for Mark Fuhrman as a defendant.
And that's not what I found.
I found a lawsuit where Mark Fuhrman was the plaintiff.
He had actually sued the Los Angeles Pension Board asking to be relieved as a police officer
and get a pension because his mind was so poisoned by hatred of black people.
And I thought to myself, now that's a story.
I show up uninvited at Robert Shapiro's office.
And I say, "I've been looking at Mark Fuhrman's file and there's some pretty amazing stuff in there."
And I remember, to this day, he sort of rocked back in his chair.
He said, "You saw that?"
I said, "Yeah".
He said, "You think that's bad, we think he planted the glove.
Fuhrman, according to this article had used a lot of racial epithets.
Having that out there, really brought home the fact that we've got a dynamic here we're gonna have to deal with.
They found a flaw in me, and then they made up a nexus, a connection to the flaw to the case.
I mean, I had a bad couple years
but I came out better, I came out of it.
It is what it is.
That article came out at just about the same time, Johnny Cochran was coming aboard the defense team.
And my thought at the time was, here comes the race card.
My name is Johnny L. Cochran Jr.
I am primarily a civil rights lawyer.
And I represent a number of clients who have had their civil rights abridged.
He and his firm were central players in this story of the LAPD and race in Los Angeles.
Growing up in America, any African American will tell you that, we know we have to run faster, jump higher, work harder, to do the same that anyone else has to do.
Johnny Cochran was always the icon to young black, brown, and oppressed people in Los Angeles because Johnny was that young dashing lawyer who took on the police.
Johnny Cochran made his name as a public lawyer in the Deadwyler case.
The latest explosion of violence in Watts really began here 11 days ago.
A negro motorist driving down here was rushing his wife to the hospital, she was having labor pains, they were stopped, stopped by a white patrolman.
One policeman got out and came around to my side and my husband leaned over me and asked him if he would lead him out to the hospital to care of me.
And then he, he didn't say anything, and he shot him.
And he fell over me.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, did you get inside the Deadwyler car with the upper part of your body voluntarily?
Yes sir.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, did you observe any weapons within the Deadwyler car?
No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Cochran wants to know, that became the catchphrase because the lawyer, himself, could not ask the questions.
He had to go through the county council.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, if you been trained to keep your weapon away from a suspect?
Yes, sir.
Johnny was like 27-28 years old then.
He was a young whippersnapper.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, while you were at the Los Angeles police academy, did they train you to put your upper part of your body inside a car?
Not specifically that, no.
Because it was a televised trial, he became a hero to everybody in to the south central community.
Few people had higher standing, deeper standing.
Johnny was always that stalwart defender of justice, fighting against the bastille.
Each of the defendants across the board were found not guilty of the assaults on the police officers.
Mr. Settles was beaten, the booking photos show that.
I want to know if they had anything to do with his death.
I want to know, whether or not, he hung himself or whether or not he was hung.
The only version that you heard of what transpired was what the police officers told you, isn't that correct?
It's not that Johnny was the only good lawyer for OJ Simpson but I would say that he and his firm were the only lawyers that would really understand and argue this case in the context of the LAPD's relationship to African Americans.
Now, did he also like a big celebrity trial, you bet.
Michael Jackson has maintained his innocence from the beginning of this matter.
He still, maintains that innocence.
He was a big character, he was flamboyant.
- I love you.
- [Hi Johnny].
We were talking about different styles of lawyering and how you make a case to jury and one of the things he said about predominately African American juries, he goes Jimmy, when is what he used to call me,
he said, Jimmy, blacks like big.
And he liked to be big.
My daughter was in the Watts parade and
Johnny Cochran was the grand marshal.
He said, "I want to see you guys at the trial."
I hadn't planned to go, but since he asked me,
I said, well Johnny wants me to come, and he asked me to come, so I'm coming down here.
I'm gonna find a way to get here every day.
OJ Simpson is about appear in a Los Angeles courtroom.
He's going to enter a plea, a date for trial will be set, and a judge to oversee the trial is going to be appointed.
This is the time set for the arraignment of Mr. Simpson.
Mr. Simpson you are charged with the crime of murder.
Are you ready to enter a plea at this time?
Yes, your honor.
How do you plea to counts one and two?
Absolutely 100% not guilty.
That's when I want to hear, you're not guilty.
He was back on his feet and ready to tell the whole world that he was wrongly accused.
And it was just the biggest bunch of horse shit.
Thank you, you may be seated.
But he sold it.
I gave him a thumbs up.
And he looked over at me and he waved at me.
He was very good looking.
And that day he was really good looking.
I may not have thought he was a big celebrity but it became really clear to me super fast that he was to others.
OJ Simpson, I really admire the guy, football, and great actor.
OJ Simpson has been a hero of mine since college.
I think he's a great man and a a great hero, and has touched a lot of lives.
I don't think he did it, doesn't seem like that kind of person.
I'm assigning the case to Judge Lance Ito.
Judge Ito is an acceptable fashion.
Judge Ito will be accepted for the people as well.
Very well, thank you, then that is the assignment.
Here's the first time we'll really get to see the system.
To see if it really works.
For someone with some money, a celebrity.
A well loved, respected, cherished type of man.
Now, let's see if justice can work for him.
There's nothing more important during a jury trial, than the selection of your jury.
You can win or lose you case right there.
The issue of where to conduct the trial, the Santa Monica court house, largely white jury pool.
Downtown LA, largely black jury pool.
Gil Garcetti, the DA, always said,
"Well it just logistically had to be downtown."
A lot of us thought that Gil Garcetti, elected official, needed to protect his reputation in the black community, a big voting block, by keeping the case downtown.
I'm confident that we can, indeed, find white, black, brown, every color juror there is, who will, indeed, be fair and impartial.
I think it would have been societally better, from the DA's perspective, to win a conviction downtown.
And to not be accused of having stacked this, in such a way that whites were to stand in judgment of black men.
If you have a juror who believes police never do anything wrong, you're in tough shape.
Certainly, you can find most people, want to believe their police officers are fair and want to do their job and so that's a given, you start with that, but you've got to find that person who
understands that in the real world that doesn't happen all the time.
We interviewed over 5000 people in Los Angeles in perpetration for the OJ Simpson trial.
The conclusions were that just presenting the straight up evidence, you weren't going to get a lot of sympathetic African American females, many harbored a resentment that this famous athlete, this charming guy, had a married a white, blonde woman
rather than someone from his own community.
But the antagonism was to her and not him.
OJ you look gorgeous right now.
How come you're so loyal to this man who married a white woman?
And was dating her while he was married to a black woman.
I mean, doesn't any of this make you feel a little less defensive of him.
Marcia Clark had this faith about her ability to connect with African American woman.
African American women had been some of my best jurors on previous cases.
Even when the defendant was an African American.
There was just a way, an easy way I had, that I could talk to them.
Now, we will show you the other side of the smiling face that you saw on the Hertz commercial.
We had trial simulations.
The one you never saw on camera.
Marcia was not received positively.
Marcia Clark, every black woman, bitch.
When they had the mock jury, the mock trial, and some of the comments came back about you, about maybe being really hard or tough, what did you think when you heard some of that.
I was very surprised, the balance of them said good things, so, you know, the media takes one kernel and blows it up into a huge bowl of popcorn.
Marcia tended to discount the fact that black women jurors didn't seem to appreciate her very much.
I had no illusions about what
I was going to be up against.
The odds were stacked against us in terms of the African American jurors because that's what the polls showed.
A California poll, released today, found that only 10% of blacks, who were surveyed, believed it is very likely, that Simpson was guilty.
The ideal juror would have been younger, i.e. someone not familiar with Simpson at the high of his fame,
Asian, or probably white.
All we want, just give me, 12 fair, responsible, unbiased jurors
who are going to follow the law and put aside their personal feelings and do what the court and the law requires.
In Los Angeles today, the judge and lawyers in the OJ Simpson murder trial began interviewing prospective jurors face to face.
Just to set the scene for you, when all the jurors walk in, all the attorneys are lined up like a receiving line, and several times during the proceedings,
OJ Simpson would turn and seem to make eye contact with people, and occasionally smile at people in the audience.
The quest for impartial jurors has been going on now for more than a month.
They called me to the chair.
When I sat down, I didn't even put my purse down.
Because I felt like it was going to be that quick.
They were going to say, you're excused.
I'm looking at the list,
I know what's coming up.
I know who's left behind me.
I know what I've got in the box.
I have to look and see, am I going to do better or worse.
There was a process, of what I have labeled as reverse Darwinism,
I call it the survival of the most unfit jurors.
Many it seems want to watch, but fewer wish to serve.
91 of 219 people summoned for
Simpson jury duty, said in a questionnaire, a likely 6 month trial would be too great a hardship.
I think it's the only way, to ensure that we are going to have a fair trial for both sides.
Jurors who were available for six months skewed heavily towards a lower socioeconomic
strata of jurors and a much more diverse jury pool.
A lot of smart jurors who might have been open to DNA scientific evidence simply went by the wayside.
We didn't have many of our type of juror.
I thought, okay, I better quit while I'm behind and not get further behind because it was only going to go downhill from there.
They said, your honor we accept, and at that point, I sunk in my chair.
I was stunned.
Oh my God, oh my God, and I told my daughter, and she said, oh mother, oh my God.
And my son, he said, oh my God, mother.
And that was it.
In the end, we did the best we could with a bad lot.
We wound up with eight African American women,
I thought, you know it will be an uphill battle but I think they'll listen.
Thrilled, we're thrilled.
We were so stunned that we had such a large collection of favorable jurors.
75% of the actual jurors believed that he could not have committed these murders because he excelled at football at USC.
The only thing that could get you through some times is that guys look at each other and say, hey man, we are SC.
We were about to walk in to the lockup from the court room.
OJ looked back one last time, it was me, Johnny, we were going back to talk about everything and OJ said, "Guys, if this jury
convicts me, maybe I did do it."
It has seven months to reach this point.
We are, and I think the client, is really, really pleased, that we can have someone stand up and speak to the tryers of fact.
Time to stop posturing.
Let's go to trial.
Have a good one everybody.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Council and the audience please be seated.
Alright, are both sides prepared to go forward, Mr. Cochran?
We are, your Honor.
Ms. Clark?
Yes, we are, your Honor.
Alright, do the people wish to make an opening statement?
Yes we do.
Alright, you may proceed.
Mr. Darden, thank you.
When we started off, the prosecution had their team of lawyers.
Your Honor Judge Ito, Mr. Cochran,
Mr. Shapiro, and Dean Allman.
And here's this new face at the table.
And to you ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Good morning.
And I'm like, why are they bring him here?
And we're here today, obviously, to resolve an issue,
to settle a question, a question that has been on the minds of people throughout the country these last seven months.
Certainly has been on the mind of my people up in Richmond, California and friends in Fayetteville, Georgia and all across the country and everybody wants to know, did OJ Simpson really kill Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman?
It was apparent to everyone in America, why he was now on the case.
Well, certainly because he was black.
If that was pearbuddy, because he was a good lawyer.
He's a good lawyer, we needed to add to the team.
Thicken the team up, that's the party line.
I thought Chris was a very good trial lawyer.
Any questions for Chris?
He was young, he was learning.
Come on, man, come on.
Look at this guy, come on, we have to drag him over.
But he was very good.
There was a little bit of cockiness.
But it was not an offensive cockiness.
I don't care what anybody says,
I dress much better than Johnny Cochran.
Johnny, I'm going to introduce you to my, well I'm gonna show you the rack where I buy my suits.
He had a pretty good reputation as someone who can build a case.
And of course, most notably, Chris was black.
And Marcia and I were not.
You hear a lot about this talk about justice.
I guess, Dr. Martin Luther King said it best, when he said that, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
So, we are now, embarked upon this search for justice.
I have to tell you personally, for all the cases
I've tried, I never felt so white.
It seems to me that the fact that blood mysteriously appears on vital pieces of evidence and it's predicted what the results will be regarding DNA, when that evidence is still in the police lab, is devastating evidence of something far more sinister.
Using the concept of a conspiracy, historically, in Los Angeles will resonate with diverse jurors, who know about this history.
You had to have someone to blame.
Detective Mark Fuhrman, now it's very interesting, that the prosecution never once mentioned his name yesterday.
It's like they just want to hide him, but they can't hide him, he very much a part of this case.
Chris Darden saw that this case was becoming this weird referendum on the LAPD,
on the history of race in Los Angeles.
And Chris, he understood those issues.
He had worked in what was then our SID unit, which investigated police abuse cases.
They obtained those warrants simply to level and make uninhabitable those locations.
Andyof the police officers that were called to testify by us, lied on the stand, it was obvious to everyone that they were lying.
Every black lawyer idolized Johnny Cochran in 1994.
And I say, Chris Darden wanted to out Johnny, Johnny.
He wanted to beat the man on the biggest stage of his career.
Police detective Mark Fuhrman, did he find or plant a bloody glove at Simpson's estate?
Judge Lance Ito must soon decide whether the jury gets to hear about detective Fuhrman's checkered past.
We knew Fuhrman was going to be an important witness.
People had indicated that he had used racist language in an offensive way, I think, in a way that jurors and everybody else would not like.
The N word, or any other racial epitaph, has an inflammatory effect, that is incomparable, and to that specific issue,
Mr. Darden wishes to address the court, and
I think I'll conclude my comments at this time.
Mr. Darden, good morning.
Good morning, your Honor.
Your honor, I think the best indication or evidence on just how inflammatory the use of the word is, is the fact that it appears that Mr. Cochran and I, the only two black lead lawyers on each side of the council table
are some how dragged into this issue, to argue the issue to the court.
They used him to make the argument, that an African American jury can not listen to the utterance of that word in some sort of dispassionate, objective way.
It blinds people, it will blind the jury.
It will blind them to the truth.
They won't be able to discern what's true and what's not.
He hit the nail on the head.
He said, if you do this, you know, then that's all that this case is gonna be about.
All they'll think about is frame up, frame up, frame up.
All they do is mention the word, say to Mark Fuhrman, hey did you ever use that N word, and he'll say, Yeah and it's over.
He must have planted the glove.
I remember whispering to Johnny, is this nigger serious?
And I'm not saying Mark Fuhrman is a racist.
Is this nigger crazy?
He was suffering from stress and it has to be stressful to be a police officer in the city of LA, geez the stuff that is going on in this city in the last five to six years.
Is he serious?
Or is he just carrying the white man's bucket?
It will give them a test, and the test will be, who's side are you on?
The side of the white prosecutors and the white policemen or on the side of the black defendant and his very prominent and capable black lawyer.
That's what it's gonna do, either you're with the man or you're with the brothers.
I must say, and this is one of those sort of bracing moments, this is why you need diversity in newsrooms, by the way, is that I came out of there thinking that Darden made a pretty good point.
That it's such a shocking word, that I found myself flinching at the use of it.
My colleague, Andrea Ford, an African American women, was outraged.
She felt it was really insulting to blacks, to African Americans, to think they couldn't hear the word and give it the proper weight.
And I remember thinking, after talking to Andrea, wow, that didn't really occur to me.
It is a reminder, that who we are and how we're brought up does affect the way we hear things.
Thank you very much, Judge Ito.
I have a funeral to attend today but
I would be remiss were I not at this time to take this opportunity to respond to my good friend, Mr. Chris Darden.
When Johnny gets angry, which is very rare, you know, he's remarkably articulate and good.
Johnny got angry that day.
His remarks this morning are perhaps the most incredible remarks
I've heard in the court of law in the 32 years I've been practicing law.
His remarks are demeaning to African Americans as a group.
And so I want, before I go to this funeral, to apologize to African Americans across this country.
African Americans live with offensive words, offensive looks, offensive treatment everyday of their lives.
To say they can't be fair is absolutely outrageous.
I am ashamed that Mr. Darden would allow himself to become an apologist for this man.
You can't justify that in a civilized society.
Nobody wants introduce race into this case, your honor.
Johnny was dying to get the word nigger in front of the jury.
He also did it in such a way that, frankly, he made Darden look ridiculous.
To come here and testify as an expert to you of what black people think in America.
All across America, today, believe me black people are offended at this very moment.
I think that Johnny was rough on him.
I think it hurt his feelings.
A lot of people thought that Chris would end up at the Cochran firm.
And, obviously, that didn't happen.
People had contempt for him because they felt like he was a tool that was being used.
So time to not to do things that it seems to me will last a person's entire career such as insulting a whole race of people who have meant so much to this country.
Let's be clear about this, the subtext of everything that Johnny Cochran said about Chris Darden was, Uncle Tom.
And it was egregiously unfair.
Johnny Cochran, among other things, tried OJ was an African American defendant.
When OJ Simpson didn't really have much of a reputation as an African American person, really.
I used to walk on the wild side, now I just take a brisk walk.
This was not a person that you thought of as a, kind of, iconic black figure in Los Angeles.
I mean, he lived two blocks from Mayor Riordan.
We wanted the jury to see Bundy but the defense said, well if we're going to do that, we have to go to Rockingham.
They do not need to go to Rockingham but if they do, show them where they found the glove.
That's all that arguable relevant.
We come to find that Ito was going to let them go into Rockingham.
He's going to march the jury through the inside of the house, which is relevant to what?
No part of the crime happened inside the house.
What are we doing there?
What we did that day is create an illusion.
When you would walk up the grand staircase there was a large wall with pictures of the family, pictures of friends,
pictures of OJ's career, problem was the overwhelming majority of pictures were of Caucasian friends and colleagues of his.
We had an African American jury and we wanted to make sure that the home setting
would reflect the themes that we wanted to reflect.
We took all of his white friends down.
Put all of his black people up.
Pictures he probably had never seen before because that is what we were told the jury would identify with.
We made him blacker.
There was a Norman Rockwell lithograph that we took from Johnny's office
and we put that picture at the very top of the stairs.
We did not remove all of his pictures with white people.
The whole house would have been gone, would have been dark, we didn't do that.
You have got to be kidding me, it's night and day.
This was an African American man's house.
Who had no associations with any white guys whatsoever.
Marcia saw the wall
and she said, "Carl, you know damn well, he has never had this many black people on his wall, his entire life."
I said, "Marcia, what are talking about?
How dare you accuse us of such things."
I was miserable, I was angry.
That is very dirty pool.
If we had had a Latin jury, we would have had a picture of him in a sombrero, there would have been a mariachi band out front, we would have had a pinata at the upper staircase.
I objected, we went outside, we convened a hearing and I said, this has no relevance whatsoever.
They've now changed the scene.
It was never relevant to begin with and now it's completely irrelevant.
You know the defense is always going to push the envelope, that's what they do.
It's up to the judge to stop them.
Ito let them get away with it.
All of a sudden he became black.
They threw off the cape and now he's one of them.
I was surprised to see the depth of feeling that so many people in the black community, certainly those around the courthouse, had for him.
I feel that he is not guilty and
I also feel that he is being unfairly treated as so have a lot of African
American persons who have been through the judicial process.
I think that you find among black people, an incredible amount of forgiveness for anybody living through the pain
of being black in America.
They were not involved with OJ in terms of critical thinking.
Why does he mean so much to you?
You know, I can't answer that, this is just something thats really struck a cord with me.
And I'm just compelled to be here.
He was a black man who was on trial that they perceived that white people were trying to unfairly harm.
They're trying to railroad him, they need to find the murderer.
Go out and look for the murderer.
He's accused but we all know he didn't do it.
He was wealthy, he was powerful, he was this, he was that, there is a B-U-T, but,
he was black.
So, he didn't do it?
No, he didn't do it.
How do you know?
I know he didn't do it.
How do you know?
I just know.
You may be at the top house in Beverly Hills, and I may be in the basement of a place in Watts
but we are connected.

(police radio chatter)
When I got there, they had the scene very well secured.
They had the entire block taped off.
Front door wide open, little music playing in the background, candles are lit inside.
Very violent confrontation.
Rage.
Two victims, blood everywhere.
We find a glove...
It's a left glove... and a blood trail indicating the suspect has been wounded on the left side.
So we're just getting into this when we find out that this is apparently OJ Simpson's estranged wife.
We have two children asleep.
I have a very brutal murder.
Someone's gotta make a death notification of next of kin.
Which is Simpson.
Lang and Vannatter were talking and they called me over and said,
"You were at Simpson's house once, right?
We want you to take us up there."
We pull close to the gate.
Vannatter was hitting the doorbell, they keep ringing the doorbell and so I just stroll down the street.
(ominous music)
By the other gate, there's a white Bronco.
On the driver's side door handle, blood.
I mean there was enough evidence outside, we gotta make sure everybody's okay in here.
Oh God, what are we going to do, Simpson's in there dead.
Well, yeah, we need to go in.
So I jumped up over the fence and I opened the gate.
(ominous music)
Bang on the front door, nothing.
Walk around to the back, there's a couple of bungalows.
The first one was Kato Kaelin's.
Kato Kaelin was a live-in friend.
We say to the police, "Check on Mr. Simpson."
OJ's in Chicago.
Well, he left last night.
Oh, thank God.
They all leave and I'm left here with Kato Kaelin.
I go "Tell me what you did last night."
He goes, "Well I was talking on the phone and all a sudden there was, like, an earthquake.
It was just like... (pounding) ... on the wall and pictures shook."
Okay.
I walk back outside and I start walking down the back, behind the bungalows.
And then as I pan down,
I see this brown, glistening...
At first I thought it was dog crap.
And then I shined a light on it.
It's a glove.
Just like the one...
Ed Bundy...
Uh, yeah, this is gonna get deep.
This is gonna be a crime scene.
(ominous music)
I make the decision to make a telephonic to the Brown family and I talk to Lou Brown and say that your daughter Nicole is dead.
It's quiet for about two seconds then all this screaming.
It's Nicole's sister, Denise.
"I knew that motherfucker, he was gonna kill,
I knew he was gonna do this."
I mean, she didn't hesitate.
Nobody comes unglued like that unless they have a strong suspicion.
We gotta look at it a little differently now.
We lock everything down, no more searching, can't do anything until we get a warrant.
Phil Vannatter called me and said,
"I've got some information;
I need to get a search warrant.
I need you to tell me if you think it sounds okay."
And he just summarized the evidence and it was huge.
Okay, yeah, go ahead, get the search warrant, you're fine.
And he said, "You know who it is?
It's OJ Simpson."
OJ Simpson?
Um...
I was never into sports, so I didn't even know what game he played.
I thought he was a has-been.
Monday afternoon came around,
Simpson came back from Chicago and they handcuff him.
It was quite surprising.
Your ex-husband's always a suspect in a case.
Okay, wow. (laughing) Here we go.
(ominous music)
He said he's gonna talk to us, which is really strange.
You have one opportunity forever to talk to this guy, forever.
He's thinking he can control a couple of cops.
Especially these guys 'cause, you know, they're pretty nice.
What Vannatter and Lang failed to do was simply to pin him down on what he did on the day of the murder.
OJ just rambled and created an interview transcript that was useless to the prosecution.
What do you mean, you were running around doing what you do?
What do you mean?
What do you mean you cut yourself in Chicago but the blood got on the Bronco before you left.
What do you mean?
There's a million things that they just let go.
Yeah, uh huh, yeah, uh huh.
Oh my God.
What I wanted was his blood, photographs taken of the bleeding finger, I wanted his fingerprints now that we've got his cooperation.
We get the blood, we get all these things we want which are going to be evidence.
And then, ya know, he's released.
What?
Why would you do that?
If he was any other guy, would you have let him go?
And they said, "Where can he go?
After all, what can he do?"
I mean, everybody recognizes him.
(orchestral music)
When I went over to Rockingham, he had like three TV's and each and every one of them, he had a different channel on.
Suspect, what are you talking about?
Is he crazy?
And I said, "OJ, what happened to your finger?"
And he says, "I cut it on a glass in Chicago."
And I went oh, okay.
Somebody else sat down and asked him the same question and he said, "I was chipping golf balls."
And I went, uh-hmm, later on that evening, same question came out, "Oh man, I was getting the cell phone out of the Bronco, cut myself."
I was like, wow.
I tried to leave there and OJ goes, "Shipp, hold on."
and he says, "They asked me to take a lie detector test.
I told them no."
I said, "What do you mean, you told them no?"
And he says, you know, jokingly, he says
"Well, you know to be truthful, Shipp,
I have had dreams of killing her."
I wanted to leave.
I said, "I'm outta here."
Here, at OJ Simpson's home, in the fashionable suburb of Brentwood, the world media has settled in to the siege.
Against the public backdrop, police are quietly, methodically reconstructing the events of last Sunday evening to answer the question:
Could this American sports hero, possibly, be a murderer?
(deep bass music)
(jet engines)
At the time that this murder took place,
OJ was at home, awaiting a limousine to take him to the airport for a promotional event in Chicago.
OJ Simpson has described him as his quarterback.
He is defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
I agree with that assessment.
(upbeat music)
He was known as the fixer.
He was a Hollywood lawyer.
He was not know as a "trial dogg" with two G's.
You hired Bob Shapiro to cut a deal.
Bob had never tried a murder case.
And so when he called me in June and said, "I need some help in the OJ case."
I was more than ready.
Well, I worked for Bob Shapiro on some of his other cases and I was pretty successful.
So they recruited me as the defense investigator.
OJ was putting together his team.
They sent a guy over to me.
"Hey man, we're putting together this thing."
"We're going to need you, OJ needs you."
And I said, "I'm not on board."
And I'll never forget that investigator's look on his face.
He said, "What?"
I said, "OJ killed her, I'm not on board."
(piano music)
I gotta say, I have a lot of fun with her.
At times, I felt like a big brother to her 'cause
I'd come over there and she'd share things with me.
And I kinda felt special that she thought enough of me to tell me her problems.
She's a great human being.
Thank you.
(applause)
I remember early in... in the years that her and OJ was dating, we were all down in the Caribbean.
OJ was working on a film, and if a lot of don't know, I'm gonna let you know now, blacks can not swim, we can't float.
(laughter)
Justin can.
Well, thank God, well he got that from his mom.
So, we're out in the saltwater, right?
And Nicole is out there looking like, you know, she was made to swim, she's backstroking and she's doing all these things.
So, here's OJ and I, we're standing on the shore and she's waving us in.
(laughter)
Now, this is saltwater, in the Caribbean.
Everything down there floats.
OJ and I got out there and we tried to float, and she thought that's the funniest thing she'd ever seen in her life.
She could not believe it.
And one of the things about Nicole, which all of you will agree, was Nicole's laugh.
Once that woman laughed, she was, uh...
She brought out a lot of goodness in you.
Nicole was very, very special to me.
That was my buddy.
And, um...
And I know, Sydney and Justin, you've been blessed because of a lot of her character and the goodness about her.
You're not going to notice it now, but you're going to notice it as you get older cause she's laid a great foundation for you two.
I love you, Nicole, and I love you too, Jason.
I mean Justin and Sydney and I'll always will be there for you.
(applause)
OJ Simpson may soon face legal action.
The Associated Press says a homicide detective has told them Simpson's arrest is imminent.
It is not only OJ Simpson's life that is coming under the media microscope.
Reporters are looking, too, at Ronald Goldman, the aspiring model, who was killed with Nicole Simpson.
His family said he was nothing more than a friend.
He was a special human being that didn't deserve what's happened.
He was gonna open a restaurant.
After Ron was murdered, we went to his apartment.
He had a floor plan, he had a menu, he had names of people whose art he was gonna hang on the wall.
He had everything worked out.
Obviously, this is your older brother.
We don't get to spend very much time together, so I'm very glad that I was able to be here.
So I love you very much and I'll see you soon.
That was all taken away.
My sister's body was gonna be behind closed doors.
I said to my friend, "I can't go in there."
And as I'm having this conversation with them I'm hearing screams.
Looking at her I can remember a black dress up to her neck because
what I had heard is that her head was almost cut off all the way.
Which even shocked me more and more.
I mean that was just like... and seeing her there, lying there in a coffin.
I mean, it really, I mean,
I don't know, it's just terrible.
He came to the wake.
It was just unbelievable.
We were all kind of in shock that he came there.
Judy asked him directly, did you kill my daughter?
No, no.
I loved her too much.
He was, like, on Xanax or something.
He was just sedated.
I leaned over to him and said,
"We're going to get through this."
I had no idea what was going on.
(orchestral music)
Action News has learned that Simpson's attorney is working on a deal with police for Simpson's surrender to avoid what the lawyer calls, and we quote, "a media circus."
(orchestral music)
Shapiro was going to surrender him to the detectives in the morning.
We're standing outside Parker Center waiting for OJ to turn himself in.
Every time a car would pass by, is that OJ?
I think it was 11:00.
Oh, no, he doesn't show up.
I think I'd already scheduled a press conference.
And it's like, oh, no.
We potentially could look like a bunch of clowns here.
I did not know about the arrangements for his surrender.
I went with the assumption that they would announce that he had been arrested.
Gascon's coming up.
Looking out at the auditorium, not only are all the seats taken, but all the aisles are jammed, the front is jammed, the back wall is jammed.
He's on the stage.
And I was the one who was gonna have to stand out there naked.
This morning detectives for the Los Angeles
Police Department sought and obtained a warrant for the arrest of OJ Simpson, charging him with the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman.
Mr. Simpson, in agreement with his attorney, was scheduled to surrender this morning, to the Los Angeles Police Department.
Initially, that was 11:00.
It then became 11:45.
Mr. Simpson has not appeared.
The Los Angeles Police Department, right now, is actively searching for Mr. Simpson.
The gasp that went through the room,
I think it's right at that moment, that I realized, oh boy, this is big.
We will continue our pursuit of Mr. Simpson and hope to have him in custody soon.
He's gone.
I looked at Marika and said,
"It's a helicopter story now.
Let's find this son of a bitch."
I can take a few questions.
(everyone speaks at once)
I'd known Gascon for a long time and he's a fairly easygoing guy normally.
You're gonna have to hold it down.
One at a time or won't be able to hear you.
Then a sense of humor to add a light touch.
You asked a question, would you like for me to answer?
He got pretty tightly wound that day.
I doubt that there's anyone around this country that's been monitoring television, radio, or newspapers, that doesn't know at this point that something's going on in this case.
If you, in any way, are assisting Mr. Simpson in avoiding justice, Mr. Simpson is a fugitive of justice right now.
And If you assist him in any way, you are committing a felony.
I was pissed off that we were in essence given the old Italian gesture.
I don't recall being that upset before in the DA's office.
I'm angry, I'm not embarrassed.
Angry at who, beyond...
I'm angry at OJ Simpson.
(police radio)
It is not an escape, he was not under arrest.
He was under sedation in a very very emotional state.
He was at a residence that is secluded, that is very, very hard to find, and there was never any thought of him leaving that residence without us.
This letter was written by OJ today.
First, everyone understand,
I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder.
I loved her, always have, and always will.
If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much.
It's 1700, 5 pm, when you have
Karsashian reading the letter.
I thought, wow, maybe he killed himself.
I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things, so why do I end up like this?
I can't go on.
No matter what the outcome, people will look and point.
I can't take that.
I can't subject my children to that.
We deal with folks who are in crisis and get to a very dark place and they just do it.
Don't feel sorry for me.
I've had a great life.
Great friends.
Please think of the real OJ and not this lost person.
The note says, to me, feel sorry for me but...
I'm the guy, you know, I'm the bad guy.
He was, Mr. Cawlings was with him, he was his best friend, he was by his side for the last few minutes alone while we were upstairs.
AC just had a love for OJ.
I remember once, in high school, a friend of mine had a starter pistol that he brought to school.
So we said okay, let's go, take the gun and pull it on OJ and act like we're gonna shoot him.
We were all down for it.
So, we went out on the field where OJ and Al were and my friend, Ray, well, he pulled the gun out and everybody sorta stepped back.
And Al Cowlings stepped in front of OJ.
And said, "Ray, if you gonna shoot OJ, you gotta shoot me first."
(police radios)
1993 Ford Bronco.
We're listening to the Los Angeles Police Department and they believe that this vehicle is somewhere in the vicinity of the El Toro Y.
And I look down below and there's the El Toro Y.
And there's a white Bronco.
Then there's a sheriff's unit and there's another sheriff's unit and another sheriff's unit.
Okay, here we are, open the door.
We get the door open and we get our very first shot.
And I'm back on the two way radio telling CBS, you gotta get us on the air, we found him.
And with a flip of the switch, we were on with Dan Rather.
This is Dan Rather with Connie Chung in Los Angeles and let's hold on a second here.
I'm seeing on the monitor this live helicopter coverage of the Ford Bronco being followed by the police.
And let's pick up some of the transmission from the helicopter.
They believe he's suicidal and very dangerous.
Unfortunately at this time it does not appear as though the driver is slowing down or complying with the orders of the officers.
We were on the air exclusively for 22 minutes.
And this was the most conflicted I had every been.
The gravity of the murder, I mean, this was a double homicide and this is a tragic story.
Very few human beings fall as far as OJ Simpson.
I've fallen quite a bit transitioning, you know, you go from being like a hero pilot to some tranny, you know, so I've fallen somewhat myself but this is like an epic fall.
And I'm weighing consequences of this with also the biggest news story, like, ever.
I'm going to use a pair of binoculars to try to determine whether or not I can see Mr. Simpson.
Fuck NBC, fuck ABC, fuck those guys.
I hope they shoot this son of a bitch.
And I hope they kill him before the competitors get here.
(phone ringing) 911, what are you reporting?
This is AC.
I have OJ in the car.
Okay, where are you?
Please, I'm coming up the 5 freeway.
Okay.
Right now we are okay.
But you got to tell the police to back off.
He's still alive, but he's got a gun to his head.
Okay, hold on a minute, Monica.
He just wants to see his mother.
Let me get him to the house.
Okay, hold on a moment.
Okay, what's your name?
My name is AC.
You know who I am, God dammit.
Okay.
Right now, that OJ's sitting there is the passenger seat with a gun pointed at his own head.
Someone turned the TV on and there he is.
14 units of the Orange County Sheriff's
Department and Highway Patrol following behind a good distance.
Oh my God, this isn't real, this can't be real.
We're dumbfounded.
Law enforcement is following Simpson.
They want him to stop.
Red lights and sirens.
It's not an escort.
Why are they allowing him to continue?
Really, the game plan is really being conducted by Mr. Simpson at this point and it's very much like when the president travels down a major thoroughfare, like a freeway.
I was wondering, okay, maybe around the next curve they've got it marked off and they're going to force him to stop.
It wasn't like they were going 100 miles an hour.
But I'm not a police tactician.
That was their call.
I've covered so many of these things, this was not usual police behavior.
If OJ Simpson were black, that shit wouldn't have happened.
He'd be on the ground getting clubbed.
But since he transcended race and color to the exalted status of celebrity, he got a motorcade.
This is not a chase, this is basically an accompaniment.
(ominous music)
Nobody is doing anything.
So I'm talking to Eddie Jo Fairbanks in the DA's office.
She said, "Well, I just happen to have his cell number, would you like it?
(laughing)
(phone ringing)
You there?
Just let me get to my house.
Okay, we're gonna do that.
I swear to you I'll give you,
I'll give you me, I'll give you my whole body.
Okay...
I just need to get to my house.
Okay, we're gonna do that, just throw the gun out the window.
I can't do that.
We're not gonna bother you, we're gonna let you go up there.
Just throw it out this window, please, you're scaring everybody.
This is not to keep you guys away from me, this is for me.
I know that, nobody's gonna hurt you.
This is for me.
He's trying, in my mind, to imply he's going to commit suicide, but he's not saying that.
So, I'm playing along with that.
(moaning)
Hey, everybody loves you, don't do this.
Just throw it out the window and nobody's gonna get hurt.
You've got a guy here that's,
I don't know where his mind is,
I really believe he killed two people.
But now he's got a loaded gun, and he's being chased by cops.
Is he gonna start shooting at the cops?
Is he gonna shoot at AC and kill...
Is he gonna blow his own brains out?
I do know if I can engage him in a conversation it's going to temporarily at least take his mind off the gun.
I'm the only one that deserves this.
No, you're don't deserve that.
You do not deserve to get hurt.
Don't do this.
All I did was love Nicole.
All I did was love her.
I understand.
Love everybody, show everybody my whole life and I love everybody.
We know that and everybody loves you.
Your kids need you.
I've already said goodbye to my kids.
You're gonna hurt everybody.
I'm just gonna have to see.
No, don't
I'm gonna go with Nicole.
That's all I'm gonna do.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Think about everybody else, alright?
I couldn't on the freeway.
I couldn't do it in a field.
I want to do it at her grave.
I want to do it at my house.
You gonna go to the house?
We were told he was going to the Rockingham location.
And that's all we were told.
If they requested SWAT to handle something, that's because they can't handle it themselves.
I was told you're going to do the talking, you're going to be the negotiator.
Drive time from downtown to the west side was gonna take 30, 40 minutes.
We were trying to beat him.
They were pressuring us.
He's pretty close.
We were estimating we were about 10 minutes ahead.
The last thing we want is for him to get there before us.
Because now we're going to lose control.
And we're on the freeway and all the overpasses, there were people already staged.
Signs, free OJ, we love you OJ,
What a bunch of losers.
I think people realized, hey, this is gonna be passing my neighborhood.
And they wanted to see OJ's last run.
This was not a somber event.
This was one of Los Angeles's largest parties.
(orchestral music)
This was lined with people.
(police sirens)
And they're running full speed down the street, trying to get to the location.
We're not used to seeing those types of crowds rush in.
(chanting) OJ!
OJ!
OJ!
OJ!
District Attorney of Los Angeles,
Mr. Gil Garcetti, will the fact that he has fled make things worse for him?
Any time you have an accused who leaves, that and the fact, we believe, shows a consciousness of guilt.
(chanting "Free OJ")
I think earlier in the week, all of us close to OJ didn't believe that he had been involved in this.
And now I think there's a sense of resignation and has been for the last 24 hours and we can't believe what's happening and there was nothing ever, ever in the past that would indicate that OJ would be capable of doing what he's doing right now.
Did they let you go?
They didn't say anything, all of a sudden, they just...
What was that?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, CBS is trying to get you in.
Now, he's pulling off now, they've just pulled off a main highway.
Judy Mullard, help us here.
I can't tell ya, looks like
Santa Monica Freeway, heading I can't tell ya yet.
Look at all these people rushing up to the corner.
No, it's an exit.
This word has obviously spread
Judy, hang on, look at all these people rushing, waving... (police sirens)
There is an absolutely utterly macabe nature to all this.
They've been cheering him on, yelling go Juice go.
Cheering him on,
He pulled off at Sunset, off the 405, he's on his way back toward Brentwood.
When I got on scene there, I walked toward the residence, there was family inside the residence and they were eating.
Looked like they had like a sandwich buffet that they were doing and they were watching tv.
Dining.
I use that clinical term.
Nutty.
(police sirens)
Both sides of the street have pedestrians, he just passed us at Barrington.
Okay, Eric, its only now probably three minutes at the most I would say to his home in Brentwood.
They're passing the church installed there.
They are heading right into Brentwood now.
He's heading to my house.
He's making a right turn, I assume, that's up into Brentwood Park, and appears to be on the way to either his home or very close to his home.
We closed the gate on Rockingham, we left this one open to force him through and make him come into where we wanted him.
There was a sniper team in this house across the street, there's a sniper team on top of the roof at the residence.
And there was one across the street.
(police radio) Use your own discretion.
You take him down if you have to.
When'd you see the kids last, Juice?
He's pulling up in my driveway.
I know, I see you, I see you.
Please, toss the gun.
Juice, just toss it.
He's pulling into his house, oh shit.
I've never seen anything like this.
Mr. Simpson, OJ please.
When we're standing in the threshold there, to my right is a television so, when the Bronco pulls into the driveway
I see Bronco, Cawlings, Simpson in the backseat and then I look right here and I get the point of view that you're seeing.
Oh my goodness gracious.
He's come home after all of that.
Just as we're trying to get words out, a young man runs up to the driver's side of the door and starts hitting at AC Cawlings.
Who is that out there?
He's just trying to help.
He's just trying to help, man.
Kardashian said, "That's Jason Simpson, That's OJ's son."
So, I told Pepabrick, I said, "Go out there and get him."
Moved him out, now we get down to the business that we designed.
In this juncture, it's very fragile.
What exacerbates, what makes it crazy, is the noise, you had a helicopter seemed like about 50 feet off the deck, every car that was in the following had their red lights and sirens on.
If you just take a snapshot, you'd go, this is madness, absolute madness.
I watched that from the newsroom and when I saw a couple of the SWAT officers that I recognized run across the shot, I thought, oh my God, they're gonna kill him in the driveway.
Just toss it please.
Alright?
Juice, just toss the gun.
I did not want him to get out of the car with a gun in his hand, they'd have dumped him, they would not have had a choice.
Juice, come on, Juice.
They resolve most situations peacefully, but they are there to finish it one way or another.
OJ, no, no OJ.
Don't, no man, don't.
Juice, don't do it, Juice.
Pick it up.
I'm thinking, okay, there are a lot of people that are betting on us.
That we're going to screw this up.
That are cynical.
That believe that we are a brutal horrible organization.
And it's just not the case.
How do they know, that the police and the DA didn't make all this evidence up, to make him act the way that he's acting?
We were recovering from Rodney King and it's so important for the people to see things that go the right way.
There is so much on the news where things go the wrong way.
Normally, that would be on my mind, but that night it wasn't.
Doors opening.
That is Al Cawlings.
He's quite, quite upset at the moment.
Yeah.
Quite emotional here.
I've got to get Cawlings out.
As much as he was trying to help, he was interfering in where I needed to do.
I needed to speak directly to Mr. Simpson, to try and keep him from hurting himself.
And Mr. Cawlings was trying to be a go between.
He was very worried about his friend.
He kept asking us, please don't hurt him, please don't hurt him, please.
And he wanted to go back, he wanted to stay with his friend.
And we wouldn't allow it, we can't.
Police haven't made a move, we understand negotiations are still going on.
Simpson, you can see him, cradling what looks like framed photos, but clearly he has the barrel of a weapon under his chin and it looks like he's just resting his chin on the barrel of the weapon.
It was the look of a defeated man.
They are, according to police scanners, talking to OJ on the phone, from the inside the house, trying to negotiate something.
I said to him very early on,
I don't think your children need to see another tragedy.
And he immediately changed the subject right to about himself, he wouldn't even speak to that.
I said I know where he's coming from.
There was so much memorabilia and stuff of him everywhere, normally you would see other photos of family members or something else, you didn't see those things, it was all him.
I told Mike Albanis, Mike, I can talk him into it.
We can appeal to his ego enough that he's going to come out for us.
His voice, in the beginning, was excited but then it called down.
The more we spoke about him, the more he liked it.
We want to show them that you're still the person you have been all these years.
This great football player, this great everything.
(dramatic music)
He asked me to come out to the car, and I said, "No, you're going to show them yourself, you're going to show them just how big and courageous you are, you're going to walk to me and you're
going to leave the gun in the car, you're going to walk out and show everyone, right now.
You're going to do this."
My personal spin, I think, he wanted to surrender when it was dark.
So that he wouldn't be seen.
Night has fallen here over Brentwood.
He had two picture frames that were cradled in his arms.
We told him, open the door, put your arm out with the frame, and the other arm out with the framed photo, so it's clear to everybody, so there was no mistaking.
Doors open, dome lights on, he's out of the vehicle.
Kinda just hunches over, shuffles six eight steps to us, and collapses in our arms.
He goes, "I'm sorry,
I was never going to hurt you guys.
I'm sorry.
I was never going to hurt you guys."
OJ's in custody.
We understand that OJ's in custody.
They're calling a code four.
All clear, all safe.
Thank you, thank you to God.
(reporters asking questions)
Unbelievable, we saw an incredible situation that's gone on for hours.
Incredible restraint by the Los Angeles Police Department.
The officer's kept their distance.
They allowed the SWAT team, the pros, to come in, they took their positions.
He'd asked me to stay with him throughout the process.
I promised him I would stay with him.
I said it's time, I gotta handcuff you now, you need to be handcuffed.
I'm sorry this is the way it works.
(police sirens)
As we take off, Simpson is amazed at the crowds.
He just couldn't believe there was this many people there.
(Free OJ, Free OJ)
And he said, "what are all these niggers doing in Brentwood?"
(crowd cheering)
I walk outside and Shapiro's there.
Shapiro shakes my hand, he says,
"Thank you for not killing OJ Simpson."
He grabbed me and went to hug me.
I go, let's just,
I wasn't in the mood for a hug and maybe I wasn't professional.
I don't know the frickin guy, right, and he wants to weep on me?
(dramatic music)
Well this is nutty did.
It really is.
I said, I have seen everything in law enforcement.
There is nothing else that can top this.
(dramatic music)
(piano music)
Later today in Los Angeles, OJ Simpson is expected to make his first court appearance.
OJ has been in jail, under a suicide watch, visited only by a psychiatrist and his lawyer.
Please,
Alright, people.
Please speak up so you may be heard.
Uh, yes.
Pardon me, I'm sorry.
May we start all over again?
Yes.
He looked a mess.
He looked like someone who had committed murder.
There was nothing about the old smiling Simpson, about him that day.
Your charges for this complaint in that you willfully and unlawfully with pronounced forethought murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.
In count two your charge is the crime of murder in violation of penal code section 187.
That you willfully and unlawfully with pronounced forethought murder of Ronald Lyle Goldman.
When he initially entered the plea, he barely choked it out.
Not guilty.
Alright, then, the not guilty plea will be entered, the case will be set for a preliminary hearing within the statutory period.
Recess.
This case will be handled as every case is handled, the case will be thoroughly investigated by top notch investigators, we will present the prosecution in a thorough and professional manner.
I amongst others, recommended her.
I was aware of her successes in the court room.
I knew she was a very dynamic trial lawyer.
I want no one to forget the fact that
Robert Barto wakes up every morning, and Rebecca Schaeffer lies buried in a grave in Oregon.
Worked extraordinarily hard, she was very facile with trace evidence, hair, fiber, and the like.
She was up to speed on DNA.
She was one of our best trial lawyers.
I think that with all the questions that we've been getting about the public sympathy for Mr. Simpson, we should not forget the fact that we have two victims, that were brutally slain.
I have to say, it never mattered to me who the defendant was, it was a question of who did it.
Whether their famous, whether their not famous.
They all get the same treatment.
You are looking at inmate number 4103970, OJ Simpson.
(camera clicks)
(cell doors shutting)
I believed he was innocent.
I was like everybody else, it was incomprehensible that my friend could do this.
I snuck into the jail to see him and there's this guy that was my buddy and
he looked emaciated, he was in an orange jumpsuit, and he was shackled to the desk in front of me.
Then he looked at me on the other side of plexiglasses, close as he could be, and he said,
"I swear to God, I didn't do this."
I believed him.
He asked me if I kind of would be the chronicler of the whole thing.
Would I write a book about the whole thing.
I backed away from that.
Then, in a moment of ultimate surrealism,
I'm sitting with OJ and Lyle Menendez walks behind him.
And I just went, shit, this is more than my little pea brain can handle.
(dramatic music)
Bob, OJ Simpson is in a Los Angeles jail cell tonight.
His attorney says he spoke to him today and that Simpson was in tears.
Now, Cawlings, was himself, arrested on a felony charge of aiding a fugitive.
Get away from my fucking house.
Simpson, had $10,000 in cash and a passport at that point.
I love OJ no matter what happens.
The murder with special circumstances, death penalty charges.
The final DNA tests are positive for intense and purposes, OJ Simpson really has no option but to admit that he killed.
The man who will lead the prosecution of the case, against OJ Simpson, is Los Angeles District Attorney, Gil Garcetti.
You said earlier, "It's not going to shock me if we see OJ Simpson sometime down the road say okay
I did do it but I'm not responsible."
That certainly sounded, to me, like a prosecutor very comfortable with his case.
I am comfortable with the case,
I don't mean to speculate as to what the defense is going to be but I have been a prosecutor for 25 years.
The evidence was so overwhelming, there was just no doubt.
A blood trail that led from Bundy all the way into his bedroom.
I don't think I'd ever seen that much evidence in any single case ever.
When you couple that with evidence of motivation, and that was the history of domestic violence, with Simpson physically and psychologically abusing Nicole Brown.
This is my woman.
This was a domestic violence case that culminated in murder.
End of story.
Both sides are going to try to place the publicity thier way but because this is a major celebrity, probably this is the most famous
American ever charged with murder, there will not business as usual.
My former criminal law professor, Alan Dershowitz, was part of what would later become known as the dream team,
OJ Simpson's lawyers.
So, I called up Alan, and I said,
"You know, what do you think of this case?"
And he said, "I don't know, but you ought to look into this guy, this cop.
Mark Fuhrman, there's something bad about him."
I first met Mark during the execution of a second search warrant.
I was impressed, he seemed to have an eye for detail.
Some of his investigative moves, particularly going up to Rockingham, struck me as this is a smart detective.
Mark Fuhrman, M-A-R-K F-U-H-R-M-A-N.
When he testified at the preliminary hearing, he did a really good job.
Blood to the left of the footprint would indicate that the person that left the scene was bleeding from the left side of his body.
And the spot on the Bronco would coincide with that injury.
He was on top of his game.
His memory of the search of
Rockingham was the primary thing.
And it was detailed and consistent.
And why was it that you did not secure the residence for a search warrant before finding the glove.
This is not a situation where we had the time to stand out in the street and just wait and wonder.
We had to do something.
I thought maybe this guy Fuhrman has done something wrong.
Maybe, he's been sued.
There was this dungeon like basement in downtown Los Angeles with all the records of civil court filings.
And I started burrowing through these records looking for Mark Fuhrman as a defendant.
And that's not what I found.
I found a lawsuit where Mark Fuhrman was the plaintiff.
He had actually sued the Los Angeles Pension Board asking to be relieved as a police officer
and get a pension because his mind was so poisoned by hatred of black people.
And I thought to myself, now that's a story.
I show up uninvited at Robert Shapiro's office.
And I say, "I've been looking at Mark Fuhrman's file and there's some pretty amazing stuff in there."
And I remember, to this day, he sort of rocked back in his chair.
He said, "You saw that?"
I said, "Yeah".
He said, "You think that's bad, we think he planted the glove.
(camera clicks)
Fuhrman, according to this article had used a lot of racial epithets.
Having that out there, really brought home the fact that we've got a dynamic here we're gonna have to deal with.
They found a flaw in me, and then they made up a nexus, a connection to the flaw to the case.
I mean, I had a bad couple years
but I came out better, I came out of it.
It is what it is.
That article came out at just about the same time, Johnny Cochran was coming aboard the defense team.
And my thought at the time was, here comes the race card.
(gospel music)
My name is Johnny L. Cochran Jr.
I am primarily a civil rights lawyer.
And I represent a number of clients who have had their civil rights abridged.
He and his firm were central players in this story of the LAPD and race in Los Angeles.
Growing up in America, any African American will tell you that, we know we have to run faster, jump higher, work harder, to do the same that anyone else has to do.
(applause)
Johnny Cochran was always the icon to young black, brown, and oppressed people in Los Angeles because Johnny was that young dashing lawyer who took on the police.
Johnny Cochran made his name as a public lawyer in the Deadwyler case.
The latest explosion of violence in Watts really began here 11 days ago.
A negro motorist driving down here was rushing his wife to the hospital, she was having labor pains, they were stopped, stopped by a white patrolman.
One policeman got out and came around to my side and my husband leaned over me and asked him if he would lead him out to the hospital to care of me.
And then he, he didn't say anything, and he shot him.
And he fell over me.
(dramatic music)
Mr. Cochran would like to know, did you get inside the Deadwyler car with the upper part of your body voluntarily?
Yes sir.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, did you observe any weapons within the Deadwyler car?
No, sir, I did not.
Mr. Cochran wants to know, that became the catchphrase because the lawyer, himself, could not ask the questions.
He had to go through the county council.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, if you been trained to keep your weapon away from a suspect?
Yes, sir.
Johnny was like 27-28 years old then.
He was a young whippersnapper.
Mr. Cochran would like to know, while you were at the Los Angeles police academy, did they train you to put your upper part of your body inside a car?
Not specifically that, no.
Because it was a televised trial, he became a hero to everybody in to the south central community.
Few people had higher standing, deeper standing.
Johnny was always that stalwart defender of justice, fighting against the bastille.
Each of the defendants across the board were found not guilty of the assaults on the police officers.
Mr. Settles was beaten, the booking photos show that.
I want to know if they had anything to do with his death.
I want to know, whether or not, he hung himself or whether or not he was hung.
The only version that you heard of what transpired was what the police officers told you, isn't that correct?
(dramatic music)
It's not that Johnny was the only good lawyer for OJ Simpson but I would say that he and his firm were the only lawyers that would really understand and argue this case in the context of the LAPD's relationship to African Americans.
Now, did he also like a big celebrity trial, you bet.
Michael Jackson has maintained his innocence from the beginning of this matter.
He still, maintains that innocence.
He was a big character, he was flamboyant.
- I love you.
- [Hi Johnny].
We were talking about different styles of lawyering and how you make a case to jury and one of the things he said about predominately African American juries, he goes Jimmy, when is what he used to call me,
he said, Jimmy, blacks like big.
(laughing)
And he liked to be big.
(drums playing)
My daughter was in the Watts parade and
Johnny Cochran was the grand marshal.
He said, "I want to see you guys at the trial."
I hadn't planned to go, but since he asked me,
I said, well Johnny wants me to come, and he asked me to come, so I'm coming down here.
I'm gonna find a way to get here every day.
(dramatic music)
OJ Simpson is about appear in a Los Angeles courtroom.
He's going to enter a plea, a date for trial will be set, and a judge to oversee the trial is going to be appointed.
This is the time set for the arraignment of Mr. Simpson.
Mr. Simpson you are charged with the crime of murder.
Are you ready to enter a plea at this time?
Yes, your honor.
How do you plea to counts one and two?
Absolutely 100% not guilty.
That's when I want to hear, you're not guilty.
He was back on his feet and ready to tell the whole world that he was wrongly accused.
And it was just the biggest bunch of horse shit.
Thank you, you may be seated.
But he sold it.
I gave him a thumbs up.
And he looked over at me and he waved at me.
He was very good looking.
And that day he was really good looking.
(laughing)
I may not have thought he was a big celebrity but it became really clear to me super fast that he was to others.
OJ Simpson, I really admire the guy, football, and great actor.
OJ Simpson has been a hero of mine since college.
I think he's a great man and a a great hero, and has touched a lot of lives.
I don't think he did it, doesn't seem like that kind of person.
I'm assigning the case to Judge Lance Ito.
Judge Ito is an acceptable fashion.
Judge Ito will be accepted for the people as well.
Very well, thank you, then that is the assignment.
Here's the first time we'll really get to see the system.
To see if it really works.
For someone with some money, a celebrity.
A well loved, respected, cherished type of man.
Now, let's see if justice can work for him.
(dramatic music)
There's nothing more important during a jury trial, than the selection of your jury.
You can win or lose you case right there.
The issue of where to conduct the trial, the Santa Monica court house, largely white jury pool.
Downtown LA, largely black jury pool.
Gil Garcetti, the DA, always said,
"Well it just logistically had to be downtown."
A lot of us thought that Gil Garcetti, elected official, needed to protect his reputation in the black community, a big voting block, by keeping the case downtown.
I'm confident that we can, indeed, find white, black, brown, every color juror there is, who will, indeed, be fair and impartial.
I think it would have been societally better, from the DA's perspective, to win a conviction downtown.
And to not be accused of having stacked this, in such a way that whites were to stand in judgment of black men.
If you have a juror who believes police never do anything wrong, you're in tough shape.
Certainly, you can find most people, want to believe their police officers are fair and want to do their job and so that's a given, you start with that, but you've got to find that person who
understands that in the real world that doesn't happen all the time.
We interviewed over 5000 people in Los Angeles in perpetration for the OJ Simpson trial.
The conclusions were that just presenting the straight up evidence, you weren't going to get a lot of sympathetic African American females, many harbored a resentment that this famous athlete, this charming guy, had a married a white, blonde woman
rather than someone from his own community.
But the antagonism was to her and not him.
OJ you look gorgeous right now.
How come you're so loyal to this man who married a white woman?
And was dating her while he was married to a black woman.
I mean, doesn't any of this make you feel a little less defensive of him.
Marcia Clark had this faith about her ability to connect with African American woman.
African American women had been some of my best jurors on previous cases.
Even when the defendant was an African American.
There was just a way, an easy way I had, that I could talk to them.
Now, we will show you the other side of the smiling face that you saw on the Hertz commercial.
We had trial simulations.
The one you never saw on camera.
Marcia was not received positively.
Marcia Clark, every black woman, bitch.
When they had the mock jury, the mock trial, and some of the comments came back about you, about maybe being really hard or tough, what did you think when you heard some of that.
I was very surprised, the balance of them said good things, so, you know, the media takes one kernel and blows it up into a huge bowl of popcorn.
Marcia tended to discount the fact that black women jurors didn't seem to appreciate her very much.
I had no illusions about what
I was going to be up against.
The odds were stacked against us in terms of the African American jurors because that's what the polls showed.
A California poll, released today, found that only 10% of blacks, who were surveyed, believed it is very likely, that Simpson was guilty.
The ideal juror would have been younger, i.e. someone not familiar with Simpson at the high of his fame,
Asian, or probably white.
All we want, just give me, 12 fair, responsible, unbiased jurors
who are going to follow the law and put aside their personal feelings and do what the court and the law requires.
In Los Angeles today, the judge and lawyers in the OJ Simpson murder trial began interviewing prospective jurors face to face.
Just to set the scene for you, when all the jurors walk in, all the attorneys are lined up like a receiving line, and several times during the proceedings,
OJ Simpson would turn and seem to make eye contact with people, and occasionally smile at people in the audience.
The quest for impartial jurors has been going on now for more than a month.
They called me to the chair.
When I sat down, I didn't even put my purse down.
Because I felt like it was going to be that quick.
They were going to say, you're excused.
I'm looking at the list,
I know what's coming up.
I know who's left behind me.
I know what I've got in the box.
I have to look and see, am I going to do better or worse.
There was a process, of what I have labeled as reverse Darwinism,
I call it the survival of the most unfit jurors.
Many it seems want to watch, but fewer wish to serve.
91 of 219 people summoned for
Simpson jury duty, said in a questionnaire, a likely 6 month trial would be too great a hardship.
I think it's the only way, to ensure that we are going to have a fair trial for both sides.
Jurors who were available for six months skewed heavily towards a lower socioeconomic
strata of jurors and a much more diverse jury pool.
A lot of smart jurors who might have been open to DNA scientific evidence simply went by the wayside.
We didn't have many of our type of juror.
I thought, okay, I better quit while I'm behind and not get further behind because it was only going to go downhill from there.
They said, your honor we accept, and at that point, I sunk in my chair.
I was stunned.
Oh my God, oh my God, and I told my daughter, and she said, oh mother, oh my God.
And my son, he said, oh my God, mother.
And that was it.
In the end, we did the best we could with a bad lot.
We wound up with eight African American women,
I thought, you know it will be an uphill battle but I think they'll listen.
Thrilled, we're thrilled.
We were so stunned that we had such a large collection of favorable jurors.
75% of the actual jurors believed that he could not have committed these murders because he excelled at football at USC.
The only thing that could get you through some times is that guys look at each other and say, hey man, we are SC.
(laughing)
We were about to walk in to the lockup from the court room.
OJ looked back one last time, it was me, Johnny, we were going back to talk about everything and OJ said, "Guys, if this jury
convicts me, maybe I did do it."
(birds chirping)
(orchestral music)
It has seven months to reach this point.
We are, and I think the client, is really, really pleased, that we can have someone stand up and speak to the tryers of fact.
Time to stop posturing.
Let's go to trial.
Have a good one everybody.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Council and the audience please be seated.
Alright, are both sides prepared to go forward, Mr. Cochran?
We are, your Honor.
Ms. Clark?
Yes, we are, your Honor.
Alright, do the people wish to make an opening statement?
Yes we do.
Alright, you may proceed.
Mr. Darden, thank you.
When we started off, the prosecution had their team of lawyers.
Your Honor Judge Ito, Mr. Cochran,
Mr. Shapiro, and Dean Allman.
And here's this new face at the table.
And to you ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Good morning.
And I'm like, why are they bring him here?
And we're here today, obviously, to resolve an issue,
to settle a question, a question that has been on the minds of people throughout the country these last seven months.
Certainly has been on the mind of my people up in Richmond, California and friends in Fayetteville, Georgia and all across the country and everybody wants to know, did OJ Simpson really kill Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman?
It was apparent to everyone in America, why he was now on the case.
Well, certainly because he was black.
If that was pearbuddy, because he was a good lawyer.
He's a good lawyer, we needed to add to the team.
Thicken the team up, that's the party line.
I thought Chris was a very good trial lawyer.
Any questions for Chris?
He was young, he was learning.
Come on, man, come on.
Look at this guy, come on, we have to drag him over.
But he was very good.
There was a little bit of cockiness.
But it was not an offensive cockiness.
I don't care what anybody says,
I dress much better than Johnny Cochran.
(laughing)
Johnny, I'm going to introduce you to my, well I'm gonna show you the rack where I buy my suits.
He had a pretty good reputation as someone who can build a case.
And of course, most notably, Chris was black.
And Marcia and I were not.
You hear a lot about this talk about justice.
I guess, Dr. Martin Luther King said it best, when he said that, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
So, we are now, embarked upon this search for justice.
I have to tell you personally, for all the cases
I've tried, I never felt so white.
It seems to me that the fact that blood mysteriously appears on vital pieces of evidence and it's predicted what the results will be regarding DNA, when that evidence is still in the police lab, is devastating evidence of something far more sinister.
Using the concept of a conspiracy, historically, in Los Angeles will resonate with diverse jurors, who know about this history.
You had to have someone to blame.
Detective Mark Fuhrman, now it's very interesting, that the prosecution never once mentioned his name yesterday.
It's like they just want to hide him, but they can't hide him, he very much a part of this case.
Chris Darden saw that this case was becoming this weird referendum on the LAPD,
on the history of race in Los Angeles.
And Chris, he understood those issues.
He had worked in what was then our SID unit, which investigated police abuse cases.
They obtained those warrants simply to level and make uninhabitable those locations.
Andyof the police officers that were called to testify by us, lied on the stand, it was obvious to everyone that they were lying.
Every black lawyer idolized Johnny Cochran in 1994.
And I say, Chris Darden wanted to out Johnny, Johnny.
He wanted to beat the man on the biggest stage of his career.
Police detective Mark Fuhrman, did he find or plant a bloody glove at Simpson's estate?
Judge Lance Ito must soon decide whether the jury gets to hear about detective Fuhrman's checkered past.
We knew Fuhrman was going to be an important witness.
People had indicated that he had used racist language in an offensive way, I think, in a way that jurors and everybody else would not like.
The N word, or any other racial epitaph, has an inflammatory effect, that is incomparable, and to that specific issue,
Mr. Darden wishes to address the court, and
I think I'll conclude my comments at this time.
Mr. Darden, good morning.
Good morning, your Honor.
Your honor, I think the best indication or evidence on just how inflammatory the use of the word is, is the fact that it appears that Mr. Cochran and I, the only two black lead lawyers on each side of the council table
are some how dragged into this issue, to argue the issue to the court.
They used him to make the argument, that an African American jury can not listen to the utterance of that word in some sort of dispassionate, objective way.
It blinds people, it will blind the jury.
It will blind them to the truth.
They won't be able to discern what's true and what's not.
He hit the nail on the head.
He said, if you do this, you know, then that's all that this case is gonna be about.
All they'll think about is frame up, frame up, frame up.
All they do is mention the word, say to Mark Fuhrman, hey did you ever use that N word, and he'll say, Yeah and it's over.
He must have planted the glove.
I remember whispering to Johnny, is this nigger serious?
And I'm not saying Mark Fuhrman is a racist.
Is this nigger crazy?
He was suffering from stress and it has to be stressful to be a police officer in the city of LA, geez the stuff that is going on in this city in the last five to six years.
Is he serious?
Or is he just carrying the white man's bucket?
It will give them a test, and the test will be, who's side are you on?
The side of the white prosecutors and the white policemen or on the side of the black defendant and his very prominent and capable black lawyer.
That's what it's gonna do, either you're with the man or you're with the brothers.
I must say, and this is one of those sort of bracing moments, this is why you need diversity in newsrooms, by the way, is that I came out of there thinking that Darden made a pretty good point.
That it's such a shocking word, that I found myself flinching at the use of it.
My colleague, Andrea Ford, an African American women, was outraged.
She felt it was really insulting to blacks, to African Americans, to think they couldn't hear the word and give it the proper weight.
And I remember thinking, after talking to Andrea, wow, that didn't really occur to me.
It is a reminder, that who we are and how we're brought up does affect the way we hear things.
Thank you very much, Judge Ito.
I have a funeral to attend today but
I would be remiss were I not at this time to take this opportunity to respond to my good friend, Mr. Chris Darden.
When Johnny gets angry, which is very rare, you know, he's remarkably articulate and good.
Johnny got angry that day.
His remarks this morning are perhaps the most incredible remarks
I've heard in the court of law in the 32 years I've been practicing law.
His remarks are demeaning to African Americans as a group.
And so I want, before I go to this funeral, to apologize to African Americans across this country.
African Americans live with offensive words, offensive looks, offensive treatment everyday of their lives.
To say they can't be fair is absolutely outrageous.
I am ashamed that Mr. Darden would allow himself to become an apologist for this man.
You can't justify that in a civilized society.
Nobody wants introduce race into this case, your honor.
Johnny was dying to get the word nigger in front of the jury.
He also did it in such a way that, frankly, he made Darden look ridiculous.
To come here and testify as an expert to you of what black people think in America.
All across America, today, believe me black people are offended at this very moment.
I think that Johnny was rough on him.
I think it hurt his feelings.
A lot of people thought that Chris would end up at the Cochran firm.
And, obviously, that didn't happen.
People had contempt for him because they felt like he was a tool that was being used.
So time to not to do things that it seems to me will last a person's entire career such as insulting a whole race of people who have meant so much to this country.
Let's be clear about this, the subtext of everything that Johnny Cochran said about Chris Darden was, Uncle Tom.
And it was egregiously unfair.
Johnny Cochran, among other things, tried OJ was an African American defendant.
When OJ Simpson didn't really have much of a reputation as an African American person, really.
I used to walk on the wild side, now I just take a brisk walk.
This was not a person that you thought of as a, kind of, iconic black figure in Los Angeles.
I mean, he lived two blocks from Mayor Riordan.
(dramatic music)
We wanted the jury to see Bundy but the defense said, well if we're going to do that, we have to go to Rockingham.
They do not need to go to Rockingham but if they do, show them where they found the glove.
That's all that arguable relevant.
(police radios)
We come to find that Ito was going to let them go into Rockingham.
He's going to march the jury through the inside of the house, which is relevant to what?
No part of the crime happened inside the house.
What are we doing there?
What we did that day is create an illusion.
When you would walk up the grand staircase there was a large wall with pictures of the family, pictures of friends,
pictures of OJ's career, problem was the overwhelming majority of pictures were of Caucasian friends and colleagues of his.
We had an African American jury and we wanted to make sure that the home setting
would reflect the themes that we wanted to reflect.
We took all of his white friends down.
Put all of his black people up.
Pictures he probably had never seen before because that is what we were told the jury would identify with.
We made him blacker.
There was a Norman Rockwell lithograph that we took from Johnny's office
and we put that picture at the very top of the stairs.
We did not remove all of his pictures with white people.
The whole house would have been gone, would have been dark, we didn't do that.
You have got to be kidding me, it's night and day.
This was an African American man's house.
Who had no associations with any white guys whatsoever.
Marcia saw the wall
and she said, "Carl, you know damn well, he has never had this many black people on his wall, his entire life."
I said, "Marcia, what are talking about?
How dare you accuse us of such things."
I was miserable, I was angry.
That is very dirty pool.
If we had had a Latin jury, we would have had a picture of him in a sombrero, there would have been a mariachi band out front, we would have had a pinata at the upper staircase.
I objected, we went outside, we convened a hearing and I said, this has no relevance whatsoever.
They've now changed the scene.
It was never relevant to begin with and now it's completely irrelevant.
You know the defense is always going to push the envelope, that's what they do.
It's up to the judge to stop them.
Ito let them get away with it.
(dramatic music)
All of a sudden he became black.
They threw off the cape and now he's one of them.
I was surprised to see the depth of feeling that so many people in the black community, certainly those around the courthouse, had for him.
I feel that he is not guilty and
I also feel that he is being unfairly treated as so have a lot of African
American persons who have been through the judicial process.
I think that you find among black people, an incredible amount of forgiveness for anybody living through the pain
of being black in America.
They were not involved with OJ in terms of critical thinking.
Why does he mean so much to you?
You know, I can't answer that, this is just something thats really struck a cord with me.
And I'm just compelled to be here.
He was a black man who was on trial that they perceived that white people were trying to unfairly harm.
They're trying to railroad him, they need to find the murderer.
Go out and look for the murderer.
He's accused but we all know he didn't do it.
He was wealthy, he was powerful, he was this, he was that, there is a B-U-T, but,
he was black.
So, he didn't do it?
No, he didn't do it.
How do you know?
I know he didn't do it.
How do you know?
I just know.
You may be at the top house in Beverly Hills, and I may be in the basement of a place in Watts
but we are connected.
(dramatic music)
That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
That was our cousin.
Cuz.
That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
What do you want?
Speak when spoken to.
Where are your scrips?
No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
We shouldn't linger.
We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
He's got apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me? You got five minutes.
Who are they?
They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
I made sure.
Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
You found me.
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing? They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
What?
Who? Ren, you're gonna get us killed! Be careful.
We don't have much time.
Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
Do you recognize him?
No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
What is it?
The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
It's what they're after.
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
A generator.
That's it?
I know that look.
You're not telling me something.
Lock the door behind me.
Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
Stay here.
Don't go.
...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.
...Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
There's three of us.
...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man. "What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest... The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too." Get up, Hannah.
What?
Why?
They're coming.
Who? Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
"You have five minutes." You got five minutes.
Who the hell are they?
Ren?
Ren?
Stop.
They'll be right back.
We've got time.
What?
You're gonna get us killed.
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
What are you talking about?
Shit.
What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
Hannah, listen to me.
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
No.
No.
What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
They don't remember either?
Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
...borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
Cyanide gas.
So you're gonna kill them?
They'll kill us first.
You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on...
Your furnace works?
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
"The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth, and curse the demon..." The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
This kid's got a mean streak.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
I have a safe.
See how easy that was?
Cooperation makes the world go round.
And money?
Where's the safe? Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips... Environ, sixty-five thousand... Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
It's for the cause, Brother.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
I'll be back.
Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
So is that a weapon or something?
No, it's not a...
Jesus Christ! Ren?
What the hell are you doing? You got five minutes.
Who are they?
You don't know?
What?
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
I told you last night.
Tell me again.
Now?
Why?
Ren, untie me.
What? Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
I got this!
Ren, un... untie me.
What is it? And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you? Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
We came for your scrips.
Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
You're too late for sorry.
I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
Just them.
Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way. ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
Jeez.
What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
Nobody gets hurt this way.
No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
Hannah! Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
Huh, like this? Hannah's coming with me.
Giving us your blessing? She won't go with you.
She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
Stop! I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash...
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just... I shot you.
Wait, you remember? Were you brats playing doctor?
Oh, yeah.
All night long.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
You do remember.
Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I...
It's not a dream.
No.
Today is repeating.
No, I have to get out of here.
Ren, I can't.
I...
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
Yeah.
How?
Why? Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
It was an accident.
What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis, but you just wanna run away.
Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, shut down the ARQ.
No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us...
We're dead for good.
Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples? So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
What's it do?
We'll find a use for it.
Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so... Mobius Common.

Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
You're running out of time.
Is that the best you... Hannah, wake up.
Sonny shot me.
Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
Torus?
What do we do?
Play along.
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
Grimm.
Did you fuck him?
No.
The plan, remember?
Get Renton to let his guard down.
Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
You're not taking the ARQ.
We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
You know, I heard this broadcast before.
Must be a repeat.
That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
Where'd he go? God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
It was your idea.
Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
Nah, he's still in the house.
How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
We should stick together.
Go.
What are you doing?
We need to kill Sonny.
Sonny?
Sonny? Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
A time loop?
Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
Did you find him?
No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
Where'd you get that? Where is he?
He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd... Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
Get a first aid kit or something!
Okay.
Fuck! Oh, fuck!
What are you doing?
Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
Why is this loop different?
Sonny's aware of the time loops.
Sonny's aware, how?
I don't know.
How did you become aware?
I just woke up and remembered.
Me, too.
So is remembering just random?
No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
And now Sonny.
Shit.
Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Oh, come on.
Just hear me out.
No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
You don't know that.
Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
Still selfish and...
I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him...
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
This is a last resort.
I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
You mean before you left me.
Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
Mobius Common.
Identify yourself.

Yeah.

You don't know what you're doing.
Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
We've been here before.
How does it end? You shoot me in the face.
Well, I guess history does repeat.
Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
We tried that.
It didn't work.
We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
Do you have a better idea? Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
You were being electrocuted, dude.
You were like...
He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back.
You all right?
Just déjà vu.
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
Ready?
Yeah.
Almonds? Cyanide.
The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die? It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
Hannah, not this shit!
Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
Forever the idealist.
Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
I call it hope.
When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren? Look.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
Torus...
I don't remember that.
Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
The crack.
It's different.
What does it mean?
I don't know.
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
We gotta get out of here.
Okay.
Okay.
Grab scrips, supplies...
Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
What?
Sky.
No!
Hannah, don't move!
No!
No.
Shit!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
Come here.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
It's okay.
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
No.
Well... sort of.
What's that mean?
Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
That thing in the garage?
Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
No!
I remember.
Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
Then you, too.
Right.
So this is for real?
Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
September one-nine.
Well, isn't that romantic? How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
It's safe.
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
Then fucking disable it.
Run! It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
Ready?
Yeah.
Here!
Here.
Take it.
It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
Hannah?
Go, go, go!

It's over.
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.
He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
Come on. iZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
What?
What?
Oh, my God.
"Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
They're in the house.
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
God damn it! No.
What are you doing?
We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
The message!
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!
You okay?
Shit.
That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
- That was our cousin.
- Cuz.
That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
- What do you want?
- Speak when spoken to.
Where are your scrips?
No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
- We shouldn't linger.
- We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
He's got apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
- I made sure.
- Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
You found me.
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
What?
Who?
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
Be careful.
- We don't have much time.
- Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Do you recognize him?
- No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
- What is it?
- The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
It's what they're after.
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
A generator.
That's it?
I know that look.
You're not telling me something.
- Lock the door behind me.
- Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
- Stay here.
- Don't go.
...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.
...Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
- Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
- You cut that into four pieces?
- So?
- There's three of us.
...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.
"What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest...
The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
- Get up, Hannah.
- What?
Why?
They're coming.
Who?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
- "You have five minutes."
- You got five minutes.
Who the hell are they?
Ren?
Ren?
Stop.
They'll be right back.
- We've got time.
- What?
You're gonna get us killed.
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
- What are you talking about?
- Shit.
What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
Hannah, listen to me.
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- No.
No.
- What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
- They don't remember either?
- Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
...borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
- Cyanide gas.
- So you're gonna kill them?
- They'll kill us first.
- You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on...
Your furnace works?
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
"The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth, and curse the demon..."
The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
This kid's got a mean streak.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
- I have a safe.
- See how easy that was?
- Cooperation makes the world go round.
- And money?
Where's the safe?
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips...
Environ, sixty-five thousand...
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
- It's for the cause, Brother.
- Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
I'll be back.
Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
So is that a weapon or something?
No, it's not a...
Jesus Christ!
Ren?
What the hell are you doing?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- You don't know?
What?
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
I told you last night.
Tell me again.
Now?
Why?
Ren, untie me.
What?
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
I got this!
Ren, un... untie me.
What is it?
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
- We came for your scrips.
- Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
- You're too late for sorry.
- I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
- Just them.
- Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
- Jeez.
- What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
Hannah!
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
Huh, like this?
Hannah's coming with me.
Giving us your blessing?
- She won't go with you.
- She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
Stop!
I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash...
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Oh, yeah.
All night long.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
You do remember.
Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I...
It's not a dream.
- No.
- Today is repeating.
No, I have to get out of here.
- Ren, I can't.
I...
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
- Yeah.
- How?
Why?
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
- It was an accident.
- What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
- but you just wanna run away.
- Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
- Fine, shut down the ARQ.
- No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us...
- We're dead for good.
- Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
What's it do?
We'll find a use for it.
Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so...
Mobius Common.
Identify yourself.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
Stand by.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
You're running out of time.
Is that the best you...
Hannah, wake up.
Sonny shot me.
- Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
- Torus?
What do we do?
Play along.
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
Grimm.
- Did you fuck him?
- No.
The plan, remember?
- Get Renton to let his guard down.
- Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
You're not taking the ARQ.
We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
You know, I heard this broadcast before.
- Must be a repeat.
- That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
- Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
- Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
Where'd he go?
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
- It was your idea.
- Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
- Nah, he's still in the house.
- How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
- We should stick together.
- Go.
- What are you doing?
- We need to kill Sonny.
Sonny?
Sonny?
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
- A time loop?
- Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
- Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
- Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
Did you find him?
No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
Where'd you get that?
- Where is he?
- He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
Get a first aid kit or something!
Okay.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
- Why is this loop different?
- Sonny's aware of the time loops.
- Sonny's aware, how?
- I don't know.
How did you become aware?
- I just woke up and remembered.
- Me, too.
- So is remembering just random?
- No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
And now Sonny.
Shit.
Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
- And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
- Oh, come on.
- Just hear me out.
- No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
- Still selfish and...
- I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him...
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
- This is a last resort.
- I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
- You mean before you left me.
- Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
- Mobius Common.
- Identify yourself.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
We've been here before.
How does it end?
You shoot me in the face.
- Well, I guess history does repeat.
- Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
- We tried that.
It didn't work.
- We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
Do you have a better idea?
Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
You were being electrocuted, dude.
You were like...
He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back.
You all right?
Just déjà vu.
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Almonds?
Cyanide.
The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?
It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
- Hannah, not this shit!
- Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
- Forever the idealist.
- Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
- I call it hope.
- When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren?
Look.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
Torus...
- I don't remember that.
- Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
The crack.
It's different.
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Grab scrips, supplies...
- Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
- What?
- Sky.
No!
Hannah, don't move!
No!
No.
Shit!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
Come here.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
It's okay.
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
No.
Well... sort of.
- What's that mean?
- Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
- That thing in the garage?
- Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
No!
I remember.
Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
- Then you, too.
- Right.
- So this is for real?
- Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
September one-nine.
Well, isn't that romantic?
How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
It's safe.
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
Then fucking disable it.
Run!
It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Here!
Here.
Take it.
It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
Hannah?
Go, go, go!

It's over.
Okay?
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.
He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
Come on.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
What?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
"Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
They're in the house.
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
God damn it!
No.
- What are you doing?
- We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
The message!
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!
- You okay?
Shit.
That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
- That was our cousin.
- Cuz.
That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
- What do you want?
- Speak when spoken to.
Where are your scrips?
No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
- We shouldn't linger.
- We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
He's got apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
-I made sure.
-Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
You found me.
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
- What?
Who?
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
Be careful.
-We don't have much time.
-Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Do you recognize him?
- No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
-What is it?
-The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
- It's what they're after.
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
- It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
A generator.
That's it?
- I know that look.
You're not telling me something.
-Lock the door behind me.
-Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
-Stay here.
-Don't go.
...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.
...Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
- Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
- You cut that into four pieces?
- So?
- There's three of us.
--...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.
"What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest...
The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
-Get up, Hannah.
-What?
Why?
They're coming.
- Who?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
- "You have five minutes."
- You got five minutes.
Who the hell are they?
- Ren?
Ren?
Stop.
They'll be right back.
-We've got time.
-What?
You're gonna get us killed.
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
-What are you talking about?
-Shit.
What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Hannah, listen to me.
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
-No.
No.
-What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
-They don't remember either?
-Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
...borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
- Cyanide gas.
- So you're gonna kill them?
-They'll kill us first.
-You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on--
Your furnace works?
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
"The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth,
- and curse the demon..."
The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
This kid's got a mean streak.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
-I have a safe.
-See how easy that was?
-Cooperation makes the world go round.
-And money?
Where's the safe?
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips...
Environ, sixty-five thousand...
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
- It's for the cause, Brother.
- Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
I'll be back.
--Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
So is that a weapon or something?
- No, it's not a--
Jesus Christ!
Ren?
- What the hell are you doing?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- You don't know?
- What?
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
- I told you last night.
Tell me again.
- Now?
Why?
Ren, untie me.
What?
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
--Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
Listen carefully.
Torus-
- Hannah!
I got this!
--Ren, un... untie me.
What is it?
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
-We came for your scrips.
-Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
-You're too late for sorry.
-I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
-Just them.
-Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
-Jeez.
-What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
Hannah!
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
- Huh, like this?
Hannah's coming with me.
Giving us your blessing?
- She won't go with you.
- She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
--Stop!
I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash--
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Oh, yeah.
All night long.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- You do remember.
Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I--
- It's not a dream.
- No.
- Today is repeating.
No, I have to get out of here.
-Ren, I can't.
I--
-Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
-Yeah.
-How?
Why?
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
-It was an accident.
-What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
-but you just wanna run away.
-Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
-Fine, shut down the ARQ.
-No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us--
-We're dead for good.
-Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
--This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
What's it do?
- We'll find a use for it.
Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so...
Mobius Common.
Identify yourself.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
Stand by.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
--Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
- You're running out of time.
- Is that the best you--
Hannah, wake up.
Sonny shot me.
-Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
-Torus?
What do we do?
- Play along.
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
Grimm.
-Did you fuck him?
-No.
The plan, remember?
-Get Renton to let his guard down.
-Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
You're not taking the ARQ.
- We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
You know, I heard this broadcast before.
-Must be a repeat.
-That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
-Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
-Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
Where'd he go?
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
-It was your idea.
-Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
- Nah, he's still in the house.
- How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
- We should stick together.
- Go.
-What are you doing?
-We need to kill Sonny.
Sonny?
Sonny?
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
-A time loop?
-Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
-Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
-Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
Did you find him?
No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
Where'd you get that?
-Where is he?
-He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
Get a first aid kit or something!
Okay.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
-What are you doing?
-Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
-Why is this loop different?
-Sonny's aware of the time loops.
-Sonny's aware, how?
-I don't know.
How did you become aware?
-I just woke up and remembered.
-Me, too.
- So is remembering just random?
- No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
And now Sonny.
Shit.
Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
-And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
-Oh, come on.
-Just hear me out.
-No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
-You don't know that.
-Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
-Still selfish and--
-I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him--
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
-This is a last resort.
-I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
-You mean before you left me.
-Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
- Mobius Common.
- Identify yourself.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
-You don't know what you're doing.
-Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
We've been here before.
How does it end?
You shoot me in the face.
- Well, I guess history does repeat.
- Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
--Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
-We tried that.
It didn't work.
-We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
Do you have a better idea?
Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
- You were being electrocuted, dude.
- You were like...
He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back.
You all right?
- Just déjà vu.
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Almonds?
Cyanide.
The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?
It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
- Hannah, not this shit!
- Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
-Forever the idealist.
-Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
-I call it hope.
-When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren?
Look.
- Listen carefully.
Torus-
- Hannah!
Torus--
-I don't remember that.
-Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
The crack.
It's different.
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
-We gotta get out of here.
-Okay.
Okay.
- Grab scrips, supplies...
- Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
-What?
-Sky.
- No!
Hannah, don't move!
--No!
No.
Shit!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
Come here.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
- It's okay.
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
--No.
Well... sort of.
- What's that mean?
- Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
- That thing in the garage?
- Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
- No!
I remember.
Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
- Then you, too.
- Right.
-So this is for real?
-Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
--No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
September one-nine.
Well, isn't that romantic?
How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
It's safe.
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
Then fucking disable it.
--Run!
It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Here!
Here.
Take it.
It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
Hannah?
Go, go, go!

--You're okay.
You're okay.
Okay.
- It's over.
Okay?
- It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.
He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
--Come on.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
What?
-What?
-Oh, my God.
"Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
- Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
They're in the house.
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
God damn it!
No.
-What are you doing?
-We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus-- Hannah!
- The message!
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!

[Brother] Shit.
[Father] That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
- That was our cousin.
- [Brother] Cuz.
[Father] That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
- What do you want?
- [Father] Speak when spoken to.
[Brother] Where are your scrips?
[Father] No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
[Sonny] We shouldn't linger.
[Brother] We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
[Father] He's got apples.
[Brother] Nobody has apples anymore.
[Father] He does.
[Brother] Okay.
All right.
[Father] Go on.
[metal clanking]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
[Renton] You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
[gasps]
[Father] You got five minutes.
- [Hannah] Who are they?
- They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
- I made sure.
- Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
[Hannah] You found me.
[chair dragging]
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
[grunts]
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
- [Hannah] What?
Who?
- [sighs]
[Renton groaning]
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
[Renton straining]
Be careful.
- We don't have much time.
- Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- [Renton] Do you recognize him?
- No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
- What is it?
- The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
- It's what they're after.
- [scoffs]
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
[typing]
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
- It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
- [electricity crackles]
A generator.
That's it?
- I know that look.
- [device beeping]
You're not telling me something.
- Lock the door behind me.
- Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
- Stay here.
- Don't go.
[news anchor on holoprojector] ...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
[gasps]
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.

The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
[Brother] Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[The Pope on holoprojector] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
- Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
- [Father] You cut that into four pieces?
[Brother] So?
[Sonny] There's three of us.
- [thud] - [The Pope] ...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.

[Hannah] Who the hell are they?
- Ren?
Ren?
- [chair dragging]
Stop.
They'll be right back.
- We've got time.
- What?
You're gonna get us killed.
[Hannah sighs]
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
- What are you talking about?
- Shit.
[inhales deeply] [grunting]
[whispering] What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Hannah, listen to me.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- No.
No.
- What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
[stammers] How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
[Hannah sighs]
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
[scoffs]
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
[sighs] Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
- They don't remember either?
- Just me.

What are these for?
- [Renton] Cyanide gas.
- So you're gonna kill them?
- They'll kill us first.
- You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on...
Your furnace works?
[stammers]
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
[stammers] They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.

[banging stops]
[The Pope] The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[sobs] I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
[Father] Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
[Brother] This kid's got a mean streak.
- [mouthing] I'm sorry.
- [whispers] It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
- I have a safe.
- See how easy that was?
- Cooperation makes the world go round.
- And money?
[Father] Where's the safe?
[beeping]
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
[device beeping]
[Brother] Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips... [device beeping]
Environ, sixty-five thousand... [device beeping]
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
- It's for the cause, Brother.
- [Brother] Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
[Sonny] Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
[Hannah] No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
[Sonny] He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
[Father] All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
[sighs]
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
[Hannah] I'll be back.
- [door closes] - [Brother] Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
[Father] That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
[Brother] So is that a weapon or something?
- No, it's not a...
- [gunshot]
[Brother] Jesus Christ!
[gasps] [breathing heavily]
Ren?
- What the hell are you doing?
- [door bangs] [grunting]
[Father] You got five minutes.
- [Hannah] Who are they?
- You don't know?
- What?
- [chair dragging]
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
[sighs] Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
- I told you last night.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
Tell me again.
- Now?
Why?
- [door slides shut]
Ren, untie me.
What?
[typing]
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
- [device beeping]
- Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
[Renton on earphone] Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
[Hannah] I got this!
- [metal clanking]
- Ren, un... untie me.
[typing]
What is it?
[sighs]
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
[news anchor] Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[beeping]
[The Pope] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
[grunts]
[Hannah] Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
[Hannah groaning]
[moans]
[Renton grunts]
[Hannah groans]
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
[sighs]
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
- We came for your scrips.
- Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
- You're too late for sorry.
- I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
- Just them.
- Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
[indistinct chatter on holoprojector]
[The Pope] ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
- Jeez.
- What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[gun cocks]
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
- [taser crackles] - [grunting]
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- [Father muffled] No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
[Father grunting]
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
[Father muffled] Hannah!
[Renton sighs]
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
- [grunts] - [thuds]
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
- Huh, like this?
- [grunts] [choking]
Hannah's coming with me.
[muffled grunting]
Giving us your blessing?
[grunts]
- [scoffs] She won't go with you.
- She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
[yelling] [grunting]
- [taser crackling] - [Hannah] Stop!
[sighs]
[Renton] I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
[Father] You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash...
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
[computer processing]
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just... [gunshot] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [gasping]
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
[inaudible]
[clanging]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
[Renton] Oh, yeah.
All night long.
[Father] Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- You do remember.
- [chair dragging] [stammers] Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I...
- It's not a dream.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
- [sighs] No.
- Today is repeating.
[stammers] No, I have to get out of here.
- Ren, I can't.
I...
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
[cutting flex-cuffs]
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
[stammers] But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
- Yeah.
- How?
Why?
[sighs]
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
- It was an accident.
- What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
- but you just wanna run away.
- Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
- Fine, shut down the ARQ.
- No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us...
- We're dead for good.
- Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
- [flex-cuffs zipping]
- This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
[sighs] [computer processing] [sighs]
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
[Hannah] I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
[clanging]
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
[cutting flex-cuffs]
[Sonny] So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
[safe beeps]
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
[Father] What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
[device beeping]
[Father] I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
[Brother] So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
[muffled grunting]
What's it do?
- We'll find a use for it.
- [muffled grunting] [whispering] Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
[gunshots]
[Renton grunting]
[muffled sobs]
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so... [clears throat]
[Sonny] Mobius Common.
[Mobius Common] Identify yourself.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
Stand by.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
[Sonny] Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
- [electricity crackles]
- Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
[grunting]
[Renton panting]
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
- You're running out of time.
- [chuckling]
- Is that the best you...
- [gunshot] [gasps] [breathing heavily] Hannah, wake up.
[Hannah gasps]
Sonny shot me.
- Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
- Torus?
What do we do?
- Play along.
- [Hannah grunts] [grunting]
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
[Father] Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
[sighs] [banging]
[Hannah] Grimm.
- Did you fuck him?
- No.
The plan, remember?
- Get Renton to let his guard down.
- Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
[Brother] Nobody has apples anymore.
[Father] He does.
[Brother sighs] Okay.
All right.
[device beeping]
[Father] Go on.
[clattering]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
[Father] Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
[whispering] You're not taking the ARQ.
[chair dragging]
- We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
[The Pope] The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
[Brother] You know, I heard this broadcast before.
- Must be a repeat.
- That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
[The Pope] ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[Father] What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
- Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
- Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
[muffled grunting]
[grunting continues]
Where'd he go?
[groans]
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
- It was your idea.
- Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
[Sonny] Nah, he's still in the house.
[Father] How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
- We should stick together.
- [Hannah] Go.
- What are you doing?
- We need to kill Sonny.
[Brother whispering] Sonny?
Sonny?
[chuckles]
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
[grunts and thuds]
[Renton grunts]
[Hannah] At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
- A time loop?
- Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
- Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
- Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
[pounding on door]
[pounding continues]
Did you find him?
[sighs] No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
[Father] Where'd you get that?
[gunshot]
- Where is he?
- He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
[grunting]
- [taser crackles] - [Sonny yelling]
[panting] [panting]
[sighs]
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
[typing]
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
[Father choking]
[Hannah] Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
[stammers] Get a first aid kit or something!
[softly] Okay.
[gunshot]
- [Renton grunting] - [sighs]
[gasps]
Fuck!
[gasps]
Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
[gunshots in distance]
[device beeping]
[door slides shut]
- Why is this loop different?
- Sonny's aware of the time loops.
- Sonny's aware, how?
- I don't know.
How did you become aware?
- I just woke up and remembered.
- Me, too.
[typing]
- So is remembering just random?
- [Renton] No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
[Hannah] We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
[Hannah] And now Sonny.
Shit.
[Renton] Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
[stammers] Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
- And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
- Oh, come on.
- Just hear me out.
- No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
- Still selfish and...
- I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him...
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
- This is a last resort.
- I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
- You mean before you left me.
- Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
[whirring]
[taser crackling]
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
- Mobius Common.
- [Mobius Common] Identify yourself.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
[Sonny] Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
- [Renton grunts] - [Hannah gasps]
We've been here before.
How does it end?
[panting]
You shoot me in the face.
- Well, I guess history does repeat.
- [Renton] Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
[grunts] [gasps]
- [gasps] - [Renton] Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
- We tried that.
It didn't work.
- We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
[whispering] Do you have a better idea?
[indistinct chatter in distance]
[Brother] Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
You were being electrocuted, dude.
You were like... [mimics electrification] [chuckles] He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back. [grunts]
You all right?
- Just déjà vu.
- [Sonny sniffles] [gunshots]
[Hannah gasps] [shushes] [gunshot]
[Sonny sighs]
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
- [Renton] Ready?
- Yeah.
[air hissing]
[typing]
Almonds?
[sniffing]
Cyanide.
[timer slowly accelerates]
[Renton] The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
[Sonny grunting and panting]
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
[Renton] They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?
[gunshot]
It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
[Renton] No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
- [sighs] Hannah, not this shit!
- Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
- Forever the idealist.
- Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
- I call it hope.
- When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren?
[typing]
Look.
- Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
- [gunshot]
Torus...
- I don't remember that.
- Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
[typing]
The crack.
It's different.
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.
[typing]
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Grab scrips, supplies...
- [Hannah] Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
- What?
- Sky.
- No!
Hannah, don't move!
- [electricity crackling]
- [Hannah thuds]
- No!
No.
Shit!
[grunting] No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
[grunting]
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
[rumbling]
Come here.
Come on.
[rumbling]
[whirring]
[gasps]
- Hey.
- [gasps]
- Hey.
Hey.
- [breathing heavily]
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
[siren blaring in distance]
- It's okay.
- [door bangs]
[Father grunts]
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
- [door closes]
- No.
Well... [sighs] sort of.
- [Father] What's that mean?
- Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
- That thing in the garage?
- [Hannah] Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
- [Hannah] No!
- [all grunting]
I remember.
[Renton] Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
- [Father] Then you, too.
- Right.
- So this is for real?
- Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
[Sonny] Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
[gasps] [yells]
[Hannah grunting]
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
- [muffled grunting]
- No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
[Hannah gasping]
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
[gasping]
[Sonny] September one-nine.
[panting]
Well, isn't that romantic?
[typing]
[Sonny] How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
[grunts]
It's safe.
[gasps softly] [sighs]
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
- [gunshot] - [grunts] [sighs]
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
[Sonny] Then fucking disable it.
[the ARQ powers down]
- [electricity surges]
- Run!
[gunshots] [grunting]
[Hannah panting]
- [muffled scream] - [shushing]
It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
[Renton grunts]
[coughing]
[Renton] Here!
[coughs]
Here.
Take it.
[breathing heavily]
[both coughing]
[Renton] It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
[inhales deeply]
[rumbling in distance]
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
[coughs]
[Cuz] Hannah?
Go, go, go!
[Cuz] ♪ 'Twas in the moon of wintertime ♪
♪ When all the birds had fled ♪
♪ That mighty Gitchi Manitou Sent angel choirs instead ♪
You must recognize me.
- He tortured me.
- Hey.
Look at me.
Listen, you're okay.
[Cuz] ♪ Jesus your King is born ♪
♪ Jesus is born ♪
- Tell me you haven't forgotten.
- [grunting]
- [Hannah groans] - [Renton grunts] [both grunting]
[choking]
[Cuz straining]
[Cuz groans] [yells]
[screaming]
[sobbing]
- [Hannah gasping]
- You're okay.
You're okay.
Okay.
[Hannah sobbing]
It's over.
Okay?
[softly] It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
[electricity crackles]
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.
He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
- [Hannah mutters]
- Come on.
[both grunting]
[gun cocks]
- [gunshot] - [Sonny grunts]
[Sonny and Renton grunting]
[panting]
[Mobius Common on radio] ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
[Hannah] Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
[sighs]
What?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
[Renton] "Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
- Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
- [typing]
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
[clamoring]
They're in the house.
[panting]
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
[pounding on door]
God damn it!
[pounding continues]
No.
- What are you doing?
- We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
[pounding continues]
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
- [Hannah] The message!
- [gunshots]
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!
[gasps]
You okay?
Shit.
That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
- That was our cousin.
- Cuz.
That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
- What do you want?
- Speak when spoken to.
Where are your scrips?
No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
- We shouldn't linger.
- We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
He's got apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
- I made sure.
- Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
You found me.
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
What?
Who?
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
Be careful.
- We don't have much time.
- Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Do you recognize him?
- No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
- What is it?
- The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
It's what they're after.
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
A generator.
That's it?
I know that look.
You're not telling me something.
- Lock the door behind me.
- Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
- Stay here.
- Don't go.
...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.
...Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
- Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
- You cut that into four pieces?
- So?
- There's three of us.
...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.
"What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest...
The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
- Get up, Hannah.
- What?
Why?
They're coming.
Who?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
- "You have five minutes."
- You got five minutes.
Who the hell are they?
Ren?
Ren?
Stop.
They'll be right back.
- We've got time.
- What?
You're gonna get us killed.
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
- What are you talking about?
- Shit.
What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
Hannah, listen to me.
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- No.
No.
- What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
- They don't remember either?
- Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
...borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
- Cyanide gas.
- So you're gonna kill them?
- They'll kill us first.
- You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on...
Your furnace works?
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
"The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth, and curse the demon..."
The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
This kid's got a mean streak.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
- I have a safe.
- See how easy that was?
- Cooperation makes the world go round.
- And money?
Where's the safe?
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips...
Environ, sixty-five thousand...
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
- It's for the cause, Brother.
- Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
I'll be back.
Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
So is that a weapon or something?
No, it's not a...
Jesus Christ!
Ren?
What the hell are you doing?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- You don't know?
What?
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
I told you last night.
Tell me again.
Now?
Why?
Ren, untie me.
What?
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
I got this!
Ren, un... untie me.
What is it?
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
- We came for your scrips.
- Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
- You're too late for sorry.
- I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
- Just them.
- Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
- Jeez.
- What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
Hannah!
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
Huh, like this?
Hannah's coming with me.
Giving us your blessing?
- She won't go with you.
- She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
Stop!
I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash...
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Oh, yeah.
All night long.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
You do remember.
Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I...
It's not a dream.
- No.
- Today is repeating.
No, I have to get out of here.
- Ren, I can't.
I...
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
- Yeah.
- How?
Why?
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
- It was an accident.
- What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
- but you just wanna run away.
- Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
- Fine, shut down the ARQ.
- No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us...
- We're dead for good.
- Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
What's it do?
We'll find a use for it.
Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so...
Mobius Common.
Identify yourself.

Over.

Stand by.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
You're running out of time.
Is that the best you...
Hannah, wake up.
Sonny shot me.
- Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
- Torus?
What do we do?
Play along.
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
Grimm.
- Did you fuck him?
- No.
The plan, remember?
- Get Renton to let his guard down.
- Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
You're not taking the ARQ.
We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
You know, I heard this broadcast before.
- Must be a repeat.
- That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
- Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
- Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
Where'd he go?
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
- It was your idea.
- Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
- Nah, he's still in the house.
- How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
- We should stick together.
- Go.
- What are you doing?
- We need to kill Sonny.
Sonny?
Sonny?
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
- A time loop?
- Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
- Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
- Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
Did you find him?
No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
Where'd you get that?
- Where is he?
- He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
Get a first aid kit or something!
Okay.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
- Why is this loop different?
- Sonny's aware of the time loops.
- Sonny's aware, how?
- I don't know.
How did you become aware?
- I just woke up and remembered.
- Me, too.
- So is remembering just random?
- No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
And now Sonny.
Shit.
Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
- And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
- Oh, come on.
- Just hear me out.
- No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
- Still selfish and...
- I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him...
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
- This is a last resort.
- I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
- You mean before you left me.
- Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
- Mobius Common.
- Identify yourself.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
We've been here before.
How does it end?
You shoot me in the face.
- Well, I guess history does repeat.
- Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
- We tried that.
It didn't work.
- We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
Do you have a better idea?
Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
You were being electrocuted, dude.
You were like...
He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back.
You all right?
Just déjà vu.
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Almonds?
Cyanide.
The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?
It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
- Hannah, not this shit!
- Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
- Forever the idealist.
- Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
- I call it hope.
- When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren?
Look.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
Torus...
- I don't remember that.
- Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
The crack.
It's different.
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Grab scrips, supplies...
- Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
- What?
- Sky.
No!
Hannah, don't move!
No!
No.
Shit!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
Come here.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
It's okay.
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
No.
Well... sort of.
- What's that mean?
- Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
- That thing in the garage?
- Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
No!
I remember.
Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
- Then you, too.
- Right.
- So this is for real?
- Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
September one-nine.
Well, isn't that romantic?
How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
It's safe.
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
Then fucking disable it.
Run!
It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Here!
Here.
Take it.
It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
Hannah?
Go, go, go!

He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
Come on.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
What?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
"Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
They're in the house.
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
God damn it!
No.
- What are you doing?
- We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
The message!
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!

[Renton grunting] [flex-cuffs zipping]
-[Renton] You okay?
-[Father grunts]
[Hannah grunting]
[flex-cuffs zipping]
[grunts] [groans]
[Brother] Shit.
[Father] That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
-That was our cousin.
-[Brother] Cuz.
[Father] That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
-What do you want?
-[Father] Speak when spoken to.
[Brother] Where are your scrips?
[Father] No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
[Sonny] We shouldn't linger.
[Brother] We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
[Father] He's got apples.
[Brother] Nobody has apples anymore.
[Father] He does.
[Brother] Okay.
All right.
[Father] Go on.
[metal clanking]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
[Renton] You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
[gasps]
[Father] You got five minutes.
-[Hannah] Who are they?
-They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
-I made sure.
-Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
[Hannah] You found me.
[chair dragging]
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
[grunts]
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
-[Hannah] What?
Who?
-[sighs]
[Renton groaning]
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
[Renton straining]
Be careful.
-We don't have much time.
-Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
-[Renton] Do you recognize him?
-No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
-What is it?
-The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
-It's what they're after.
-[scoffs]
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
[typing]
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
-It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
-[electricity crackles]
A generator.
That's it?
-I know that look.
-[device beeping]
You're not telling me something.
-Lock the door behind me.
-Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
-Stay here.
-Don't go.
[news anchor on holoprojector] ...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
[gasps]
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.
[news anchor] ...
Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
[Brother] Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[The Pope on holoprojector] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
-Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
-[Father] You cut that into four pieces?
[Brother] So?
[Sonny] There's three of us.
-[thud] -[The Pope] ...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.
[metal clatters]
"What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest... [grunting]
[gasping]
The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
[gasps] [breathing heavily]
-Get up, Hannah.
-What?
Why?
They're coming.
-[Hannah] Who?
-[door bangs] [grunting]
[clanging]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
[Father] Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
-"You have five minutes." -[whispers] You got five minutes.
[Hannah] Who the hell are they?
-Ren?
Ren?
-[chair dragging]
Stop.
They'll be right back.
-We've got time.
-What?
You're gonna get us killed.
[Hannah sighs]
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
-What are you talking about?
-Shit.
[inhales deeply] [grunting]
[whispering] What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
-Hannah, listen to me.
-[cutting flex-cuffs]
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
-No.
No.
-What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
[stammers] How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
[Hannah sighs]
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
[scoffs]
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
[sighs] Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
-They don't remember either?
-Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
[news anchor] Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.

Torus executives...
[Brother] Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
[Brother] Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[The Pope on holoprojector] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
-[Renton] Cyanide gas.
-So you're gonna kill them?
-They'll kill us first.
-You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on--
Your furnace works?
[stammers]
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
[stammers] They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
[The Pope] "The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth,
-and curse the demon..." -[inhales deeply] [grunts]
[panting]
-[Sonny yells] -[banging on door]
[banging stops]
[The Pope] The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[sobs] I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
[Father] Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
[Brother] This kid's got a mean streak.
-[mouthing] I'm sorry.
-[whispers] It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
-I have a safe.
-See how easy that was?
-Cooperation makes the world go round.
-And money?
[Father] Where's the safe?
[beeping]
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
[device beeping]
[Brother] Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips... [device beeping]
Environ, sixty-five thousand... [device beeping]
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
-It's for the cause, Brother.
-[Brother] Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
[Sonny] Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
[Hannah] No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
[Sonny] He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
[Father] All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
[sighs]
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
[Hannah] I'll be back.
-[door closes] -[Brother] Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
[Father] That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
[Brother] So is that a weapon or something?
-No, it's not a-- -[gunshot]
[Brother] Jesus Christ!
[gasps] [breathing heavily]
Ren?
-What the hell are you doing?
-[door bangs] [grunting]
[Father] You got five minutes.
-[Hannah] Who are they?
-You don't know?
-What?
-[chair dragging]
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
[sighs] Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
-I told you last night.
-[cutting flex-cuffs]
Tell me again.
-Now?
Why?
-[door slides shut]
Ren, untie me.
What?
[typing]
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
-[device beeping]
-Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
[Renton on earphone] Listen carefully.
Torus-
- Hannah!
[Hannah] I got this!
-[metal clanking]
-Ren, un... untie me.
[typing]
What is it?
[sighs]
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
[news anchor] Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[beeping]
[The Pope] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
[grunts]
[Hannah] Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
[Hannah groaning]
[moans]
[Renton grunts]
[Hannah groans]
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
[sighs]
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
-We came for your scrips.
-Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
-You're too late for sorry.
-I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
-Just them.
-Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
[indistinct chatter on holoprojector]
[The Pope] ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
-Jeez.
-What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[gun cocks]
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
-[taser crackles] -[grunting]
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
-Nobody gets hurt this way.
-[Father muffled] No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
[Father grunting]
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
[Father muffled] Hannah!
[Renton sighs]
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
-[grunts] -[thuds]
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
-Huh, like this?
-[grunts] [choking]
Hannah's coming with me.
[muffled grunting]
Giving us your blessing?
[grunts]
-[scoffs] She won't go with you.
-She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
[yelling] [grunting]
-[taser crackling] -[Hannah] Stop!
[sighs]
[Renton] I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
[Father] You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash--
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
[computer processing]
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just... [gunshot] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [gasping]
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
[inaudible]
[clanging]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
[Renton] Oh, yeah.
All night long.
[Father] Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
-You do remember.
-[chair dragging] [stammers] Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I--
-It's not a dream.
-[cutting flex-cuffs]
-[sighs] No.
-Today is repeating.
[stammers] No, I have to get out of here.
-Ren, I can't.
I--
-Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
[cutting flex-cuffs]
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
[stammers] But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
-Yeah.
-How?
Why?
[sighs]
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
-It was an accident.
-What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
-but you just wanna run away.
-Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
-Fine, shut down the ARQ.
-No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us--
-We're dead for good.
-Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
-[flex-cuffs zipping]
-This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
[sighs] [computer processing] [sighs]
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
[Hannah] I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
[clanging]
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
[cutting flex-cuffs]
[Sonny] So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
[safe beeps]
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
[Father] What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
[device beeping]
[Father] I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
[Brother] So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
[muffled grunting]
What's it do?
-We'll find a use for it.
-[muffled grunting] [whispering] Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
[gunshots]
[Renton grunting]
[muffled sobs]
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so... [clears throat]
[Sonny] Mobius Common.
[Mobius Common] Identify yourself.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
Stand by.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
[Sonny] Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
-[electricity crackles]
-Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
[grunting]
[Renton panting]
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
-You're running out of time.
-[chuckling]
-Is that the best you-- -[gunshot] [gasps] [breathing heavily] Hannah, wake up.
[Hannah gasps]
Sonny shot me.
-Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
-Torus?
What do we do?
-Play along.
-[Hannah grunts] [grunting]
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
[Father] Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
[sighs] [banging]
[Hannah] Grimm.
-Did you fuck him?
-No.
The plan, remember?
-Get Renton to let his guard down.
-Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
[Brother] Nobody has apples anymore.
[Father] He does.
[Brother sighs] Okay.
All right.
[device beeping]
[Father] Go on.
[clattering]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
[Father] Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
[whispering] You're not taking the ARQ.
[chair dragging]
-We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
-[cutting flex-cuffs]
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
[The Pope] The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
[Brother] You know, I heard this broadcast before.
-Must be a repeat.
-That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
[The Pope] ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[Father] What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
-Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
-Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
[muffled grunting]
[grunting continues]
Where'd he go?
[groans]
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
-It was your idea.
-Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
[Sonny] Nah, he's still in the house.
[Father] How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
-We should stick together.
-[Hannah] Go.
-What are you doing?
-We need to kill Sonny.
[Brother whispering] Sonny?
Sonny?
[chuckles]
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
[grunts and thuds]
[Renton grunts]
[Hannah] At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
-A time loop?
-Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
-Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
-Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
[pounding on door]
[pounding continues]
Did you find him?
[sighs] No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
[Father] Where'd you get that?
[gunshot]
-Where is he?
-He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
[grunting]
-[taser crackles] -[Sonny yelling]
[panting] [panting]
[sighs]
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
[typing]
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
[Father choking]
[Hannah] Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
[stammers] Get a first aid kit or something!
[softly] Okay.
[gunshot]
-[Renton grunting] -[sighs]
[gasps]
Fuck!
[gasps]
Oh, fuck!
-What are you doing?
-Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
[gunshots in distance]
[device beeping]
[door slides shut]
-Why is this loop different?
-Sonny's aware of the time loops.
-Sonny's aware, how?
-I don't know.
How did you become aware?
-I just woke up and remembered.
-Me, too.
[typing]
-So is remembering just random?
-[Renton] No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
[Hannah] We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
[Hannah] And now Sonny.
Shit.
[Renton] Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
[stammers] Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
-And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
-Oh, come on.
-Just hear me out.
-No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
-You don't know that.
-Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
-Still selfish and--
-I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him--
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
-This is a last resort.
-I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
-You mean before you left me.
-Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
[whirring]
[taser crackling]
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
-Mobius Common.
-[Mobius Common] Identify yourself.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
[Sonny] Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
-You don't know what you're doing.
-Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
-[Renton grunts] -[Hannah gasps]
We've been here before.
How does it end?
[panting]
You shoot me in the face.
-Well, I guess history does repeat.
-[Renton] Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
[grunts] [gasps]
-[gasps] -[Renton] Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
-We tried that.
It didn't work.
-We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
[whispering] Do you have a better idea?
[indistinct chatter in distance]
[Brother] Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
You were being electrocuted, dude.
You were like... [mimics electrification] [chuckles] He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back. [grunts]
You all right?
-Just déjà vu.
-[Sonny sniffles] [gunshots]
[Hannah gasps] [shushes] [gunshot]
[Sonny sighs]
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
-[Renton] Ready?
-Yeah.
[air hissing]
[typing]
Almonds?
[sniffing]
Cyanide.
[timer slowly accelerates]
[Renton] The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
[Sonny grunting and panting]
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
[Renton] They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?
[gunshot]
It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
[Renton] No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
-[sighs] Hannah, not this shit!
-Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
-Forever the idealist.
-Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
-I call it hope.
-When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren?
[typing]
Look.
-Listen carefully.
Torus-
- Hannah!
-[gunshot]
Torus--
-I don't remember that.
-Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
[typing]
The crack.
It's different.
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.
[typing]
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
-We gotta get out of here.
-Okay.
Okay.
-Grab scrips, supplies...
-[Hannah] Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
-What?
-Sky.
-No!
Hannah, don't move!
-[electricity crackling]
-[Hannah thuds]
-No!
No.
Shit!
[grunting] No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
[grunting]
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
[rumbling]
Come here.
Come on.
[rumbling]
[whirring]
[gasps]
-Hey.
-[gasps]
-Hey.
Hey.
-[breathing heavily]
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
[siren blaring in distance]
-It's okay.
-[door bangs]
[Father grunts]
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
-[door closes]
-No.
Well... [sighs] sort of.
-[Father] What's that mean?
-Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
-That thing in the garage?
-[Hannah] Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
-[Hannah] No!
-[all grunting]
I remember.
[Renton] Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
-[Father] Then you, too.
-Right.
-So this is for real?
-Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
[Sonny] Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
[gasps] [yells]
[Hannah grunting]
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
-[muffled grunting]
-No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
[Hannah gasping]
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
[gasping]
[Sonny] September one-nine.
[panting]
Well, isn't that romantic?
[typing]
[Sonny] How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
[grunts]
It's safe.
[gasps softly] [sighs]
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
-[gunshot] -[grunts] [sighs]
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
[Sonny] Then fucking disable it.
[the ARQ powers down]
-[electricity surges]
-Run!
[gunshots] [grunting]
[Hannah panting]
-[muffled scream] -[shushing]
It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
[Renton grunts]
[coughing]
[Renton] Here!
[coughs]
Here.
Take it.
[breathing heavily]
[both coughing]
[Renton] It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
[inhales deeply]
[rumbling in distance]
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
[coughs]
[Cuz] Hannah?
Go, go, go!
[Cuz] ♪ 'Twas in the moon of wintertime ♪
♪ When all the birds had fled ♪
♪ That mighty Gitchi Manitou Sent angel choirs instead ♪
You must recognize me.
-He tortured me.
-Hey.
Look at me.
Listen, you're okay.
[Cuz] ♪ Jesus your King is born ♪
♪ Jesus is born ♪
-Tell me you haven't forgotten.
-[grunting]
-[Hannah groans] -[Renton grunts] [both grunting]
[choking]
[Cuz straining]
[Cuz groans] [yells]
[screaming]
[sobbing]
-[Hannah gasping]
-You're okay.
You're okay.
Okay.
[Hannah sobbing]
It's over.
Okay?
[softly] It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
[electricity crackles]
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.
He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
-[Hannah mutters]
-Come on.
[both grunting]
[gun cocks]
-[gunshot] -[Sonny grunts]
[Sonny and Renton grunting]
[panting]
[Mobius Common on radio] ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
[Hannah] Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
[sighs]
What?
-What?
-Oh, my God.
[Renton] "Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
-Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
-[typing]
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
[clamoring]
They're in the house.
[panting]
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
[pounding on door]
God damn it!
[pounding continues]
No.
-What are you doing?
-We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
[pounding continues]
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus-- Hannah!
-[Hannah] The message!
-[gunshots]
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!
[gasps]
- You okay?
Shit.
That guy you fried with your clever little trap?
- That was our cousin.
- Cuz.
That's Brother.
Sonny.
You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
- What do you want?
- Speak when spoken to.
Where are your scrips?
No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
- We shouldn't linger.
- We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
He's got apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
You touch her and you die.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
-I made sure.
-Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
You found me.
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
- What?
Who?
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
Be careful.
-We don't have much time.
-Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Do you recognize him?
- No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
-What is it?
-The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
- It's what they're after.
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
- It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
A generator.
That's it?
- I know that look.
You're not telling me something.
-Lock the door behind me.
-Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
-Stay here.
-Don't go.
...the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
...citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
The island signed a treaty that cedes all resources and citizens to the conglomerate's North American division.
The reunification comes six days after the island's only remaining nuclear desalination plant was destroyed by Bloc missiles.
Bloc drone missiles.
More Torus lies.
...Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
- Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
- You cut that into four pieces?
- So?
- There's three of us.
--...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.
"What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest...
The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
-Get up, Hannah.
-What?
Why?
They're coming.
- Who?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
- "You have five minutes."
- You got five minutes.
Who the hell are they?
- Ren?
Ren?
Stop.
They'll be right back.
-We've got time.
-What?
You're gonna get us killed.
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
-What are you talking about?
-Shit.
What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Hannah, listen to me.
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
-No.
No.
-What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
-They don't remember either?
-Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
...borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
- Cyanide gas.
- So you're gonna kill them?
-They'll kill us first.
-You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on--
Your furnace works?
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
"The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth,
- and curse the demon..."
The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
This kid's got a mean streak.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
-I have a safe.
-See how easy that was?
-Cooperation makes the world go round.
-And money?
Where's the safe?
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips...
Environ, sixty-five thousand...
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
- It's for the cause, Brother.
- Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
I'll be back.
--Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
So is that a weapon or something?
- No, it's not a--
Jesus Christ!
Ren?
- What the hell are you doing?
You got five minutes.
- Who are they?
- You don't know?
- What?
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
- I told you last night.
Tell me again.
- Now?
Why?
Ren, untie me.
What?
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
--Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
Listen carefully.
Torus-
- Hannah!
I got this!
--Ren, un... untie me.
What is it?
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
-We came for your scrips.
-Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
-You're too late for sorry.
-I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
-Just them.
-Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
-Jeez.
-What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
Hannah!
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
- Huh, like this?
Hannah's coming with me.
Giving us your blessing?
- She won't go with you.
- She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
--Stop!
I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash--
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
Were you brats playing doctor?
Oh, yeah.
All night long.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- You do remember.
Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I--
- It's not a dream.
- No.
- Today is repeating.
No, I have to get out of here.
-Ren, I can't.
I--
-Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
-Yeah.
-How?
Why?
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
-It was an accident.
-What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
-but you just wanna run away.
-Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
-Fine, shut down the ARQ.
-No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us--
-We're dead for good.
-Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
--This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
What's it do?
- We'll find a use for it.
Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so...

Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
--Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
- You're running out of time.
- Is that the best you--
Hannah, wake up.
Sonny shot me.
-Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
-Torus?
What do we do?
- Play along.
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
Grimm.
-Did you fuck him?
-No.
The plan, remember?
-Get Renton to let his guard down.
-Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
Nobody has apples anymore.
He does.
Okay.
All right.
Go on.
Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
You're not taking the ARQ.
- We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
You know, I heard this broadcast before.
-Must be a repeat.
-That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
-Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
-Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
Where'd he go?
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
-It was your idea.
-Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
- Nah, he's still in the house.
- How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
- We should stick together.
- Go.
-What are you doing?
-We need to kill Sonny.
Sonny?
Sonny?
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
-A time loop?
-Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
-Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
-Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
Did you find him?
No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
Where'd you get that?
-Where is he?
-He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
Get a first aid kit or something!
Okay.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
-What are you doing?
-Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
-Why is this loop different?
-Sonny's aware of the time loops.
-Sonny's aware, how?
-I don't know.
How did you become aware?
-I just woke up and remembered.
-Me, too.
- So is remembering just random?
- No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
And now Sonny.
Shit.
Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
-And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
-Oh, come on.
-Just hear me out.
-No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
-You don't know that.
-Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
-Still selfish and--
-I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him--
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
-This is a last resort.
-I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
-You mean before you left me.
-Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
- Mobius Common.
- Identify yourself.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
-You don't know what you're doing.
-Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.
What's the login?
Sky.
Sky.
We've been here before.
How does it end?
You shoot me in the face.
- Well, I guess history does repeat.
- Okay.
Okay.
Just...
I'll shut it down.
--Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.
-We tried that.
It didn't work.
-We try again.
Do the same thing, expect different results?
Do you have a better idea?
Hey, he wasn't moving for a second.
It was crazy.
Sonny saved your life, man.
- You were being electrocuted, dude.
- You were like...
He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back.
You all right?
- Just déjà vu.
All right, change of plans?
This is it.
What about the target?
Is he here?
We gotta disable that before we take him down.
Why?
How well do you know that Cuz guy?
I don't.
He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet.
He didn't say much.
You're sure this is safe?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Almonds?
Cyanide.
The ARQ is speeding up.
The faster it spins, the faster time moves.
Why are we doing this?
Don't be mad now.
They'll die before the ARQ resets.
Okay?
It'll work.
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...
What?
What happened?
It's not as if something happened... it's more that everything stopped happening.
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?
It's safe.
Cyanide did this?
No.
Sonny did this.
Were the loops making him crazy?
No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.
- Hannah, not this shit!
- Ren, wha...
We can end the war.
What?
A few rebels defeating the largest corporation on Earth?
Yes, it can happen.
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.
-Forever the idealist.
-Forever the pessimist.
Realist, okay?
Evidence and facts, not wishful thinking.
-I call it hope.
-When did you become so naive?
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Oh, my God.
What?
Ren?
Look.
- Listen carefully.
Torus-
- Hannah!
Torus--
-I don't remember that.
-Neither do I.
This was recorded just before the loop resets.
The crack.
It's different.
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.
Oh, shit!
ZMPs.
-We gotta get out of here.
-Okay.
Okay.
- Grab scrips, supplies...
- Yep.
I'll lock it down.
There's something in his mouth.
Our code word.
-What?
-Sky.
- No!
Hannah, don't move!
--No!
No.
Shit!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.
Come on, Hannah.
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.
Hannah.
Hannah, come on.
Come on.
Come here.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.
- It's okay.
Stop!
Stop.
What?
No, don't!
Where's Sonny?
Where is he?
There goes the plan.
Sonny just stopped Cuz from being electrocuted, didn't he?
Did you tell him?
--No.
Well... sort of.
- What's that mean?
- Sonny and Cuz are mercs.
Come on.
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.
- That thing in the garage?
- Yes.
What about it?
It loops time.
We've been reliving the same day over and over.
Oh, brother!
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.
Us?
Liar.
- No!
I remember.
Prove it.
Grimm, what do you remember?
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.
- Then you, too.
- Right.
-So this is for real?
-Yes.
You gonna help us?
What do we do?
You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?
Quiet.
Sonny shot you because you were aware.
So?
If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?
Sonny would expect him to betray him.
What?
You two really are mercs.
Go on.
Kneel down.
Kneel down!
Kneel down.
Down on your...
No.
No, not you.
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.
Go to hell.
Now, at the risk of repeating myself, what's the goddamn login?
Don't fucking tell him.
--No!
Don't!
Don't!
September 19.
September one-nine.
Enough!
September 19!
Stop.
September one-nine.
Well, isn't that romantic?
How do I disable it?
Command F6.
Now go touch it.
Then I'll throw you.
It's safe.
Oh, will you look at that?
Sonny.
My brother, you don't need me.
So I'll just go.
He's right.
We don't need him.
Shit.
It's still spinning.
There's a manual shutdown.
Then fucking disable it.
--Run!
It's not mine.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Here!
Here.
Take it.
It feels petrified.
What is it?
I think it's a boundary.
The time loop ends here.
So only time inside the circle has been looping?
Hannah, there's a safe house two blocks north.
It's marked as contaminated.
It's not.
I will meet you there.
You're coming with me.
No.
I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.
Go.
I won't leave you.
Hannah?
Go, go, go!

It's over.
It's over.
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.
He must want the loop to reset.
It's okay.
Come on.
--Come on.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Sonny called in ZMPs.
Okay.
We download everything.
Burn it all.
There isn't time.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.
Really?
If there's no world left, there's no hope for us.
What?
-What?
-Oh, my God.
"Interruption."
These time logs are the nine loops we've gone through.
- Nine loops makes one sequence.
There's...
There's more sequences.
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?
Ren, how many times have we loop...
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.
The last timeline in every sequence is broken.
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ and Sonny rebooted it.
When the ARQ reboots, our memories must reset.
That's why we don't remember the video.
The video was recorded in the last sequence.
It was a message to us.
And a ZMP stopped the message.
They're in the house.
Damn it!
If Torus gets the ARQ... they win the war.
We have to destroy it.
God damn it!
No.
-What are you doing?
-We let the loop reset.
We try again.
We've tried already, thousands of times.
We send a message to ourselves in the next loop.
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.
Hurry.
Listen carefully.
Torus-- Hannah!
- The message!
Torus found you.
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!

You can call me Father.
And you two?
You two are the kids.
- What do you want?
- [Father] Speak when spoken to.
[Brother] Where are your scrips?
[Father] No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.
[Sonny] We shouldn't linger.
[Brother] We haven't eaten in two days.
This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.
[Father] He's got apples.
[Brother] Nobody has apples anymore.
[Father] He does.
[Brother] Okay.
All right.

[Father] You got five minutes.
- [Hannah] Who are they?
- They followed you.
No one followed me, Ren.
- I made sure.
- Nobody knew I was here except you.
You show up late last night, then those guys show up?
[Hannah] You found me.
[chair dragging]
Ren, shh.
You told me to come.
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.
What are you doing?
[grunts]
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.
- [Hannah] What?
Who?
- [sighs]
[Renton groaning]
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!
[Renton straining]
Be careful.
- We don't have much time.
- Time for... for what?
Those guys want more than just scrips.
What?
Ren, listen to me, okay?
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- [Renton] Do you recognize him?
- No.
I think he was there when Torus tried to arrest me.
Don't!
Don't touch it.
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.
It's how this guy died.
- What is it?
- The ARQ.
The ARQ?
Arcing recursive quine.
- It's what they're after.
- [scoffs]
No, they're starving like everybody else.
So unless this thing is a food processor, I doubt they give a shit about it.
No, Torus sent those bastards to take it back.
[typing]
This is what you stole from Torus?
I didn't steal it.
I built it.
What's it do?
- It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.
- [electricity crackles]
A generator.
That's it?
- I know that look.
- [device beeping]
You're not telling me something.
- Lock the door behind me.
- Ren.
Ren, don't go.
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.
You're gonna get us killed.
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.
Don't say that.
I just needed to see you again.
- Stay here.
- Don't go.

The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
[Brother] Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[The Pope on holoprojector] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus execs claim that the energy crisis threatens humankind.
I agree.
- Torus claims to be humanity's savior...
- [Father] You cut that into four pieces?
[Brother] So?
[Sonny] There's three of us.
- [thud] - [The Pope] ...our executioner.
Listen to the mad words of a wise man.
[metal clatters]
"What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest... [grunting]
[gasping]
The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
[gasps] [breathing heavily]
- Get up, Hannah.
- What?
Why?
They're coming.
- [Hannah] Who?
- [door bangs] [grunting]
[clanging]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
Touch her and you die.
[Father] Whoa.
So menacing.
Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
- "You have five minutes." - [whispers] You got five minutes.
[Hannah] Who the hell are they?
- Ren?
Ren?
- [chair dragging]
Stop.
They'll be right back.
- We've got time.
- What?
You're gonna get us killed.
[Hannah sighs]
Okay.
Hannah, listen to me, okay?
Right now, this very moment, it's happened before.
Twice, I think.
- What are you talking about?
- Shit.
[inhales deeply] [grunting]
[whispering] What the hell are you doing?
Ren, you're going to get us killed.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ren?
Okay, listen to me.
There's three of them, and they've got a gun.
- Hannah, listen to me.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.
Come on, you have to remember.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- No.
No.
- What?
Incredible.
I think...
I think the ARQ is causing time to loop.
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
I remember.
Okay, this guy, um, he's got a big scar across his face.
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.
The big guy?
Brother?
Dark hair, baby face.
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.
[stammers] How did you know that?
Because it's happened before.
Twice.
Don't touch it.
[Hannah sighs]
What else do you remember?
Nothing... except that Father guy killed me.
[scoffs]
Well, how come you remember and I don't?
I don't know.
[sighs] Oh, and what about those idiots with the code names?
- They don't remember either?
- Just me.
Hannah, you don't have to believe me, but I need you to trust me.
[news anchor] Torus Corporation's global military operation against rogue states and Bloc coalition terrorists, the so-called Energy Wars, dominate headlines worldwide.
On the West Coast, citizens and non-citizens celebrate the reunification of Los Angeles Island with Torus Corporation.
...borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives...
[Brother] Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
[Brother] Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[The Pope on holoprojector] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
What are these for?
- [Renton] Cyanide gas.
- So you're gonna kill them?
- They'll kill us first.
- You don't know that.
They already killed me.
I'm gonna crank up the thermostat.
As soon as the furnace turns on...
Your furnace works?
[stammers]
Okay, nobody has that much electricity.
Not around here.
The ARQ powers the house.
The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.
It feeds the entire house.
They won't be safe anywhere.
[stammers] They have masks.
Air masks.
They need gas masks.
You ready?
Is it painless?
It's quick.
[The Pope] "The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth,
- and curse the demon..." - [inhales deeply] [grunts]
[panting]
- [Sonny yells] - [banging on door]
[banging stops]
[The Pope] The only species left for us to destroy is ourselves.
If the Bloc and free states don't surrender to the Torus Corporation, what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[sobs] I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
[Father] Mask off and lose the glove.
Now.
I wasn't lying when I said we just wanted your scrips, but here you go and try and gas us.
[Brother] This kid's got a mean streak.
- [mouthing] I'm sorry.
- [whispers] It's okay.
Hands.
Where are your scrips?
Just tell them.
- I have a safe.
- See how easy that was?
- Cooperation makes the world go round.
- And money?
[Father] Where's the safe?
[beeping]
Hannah, it's gonna be okay.
[device beeping]
[Brother] Thirty thousand in StomaChem scrips... [device beeping]
Environ, sixty-five thousand... [device beeping]
Jackpot.
Over a million in Torus scrips.
We're gonna have ourselves a good time, boys.
- It's for the cause, Brother.
- [Brother] Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But we're gonna get a finder's fee.
You got what you came for.
Now go.
He can identify us.
[Sonny] Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him right now.
[Hannah] No!
Nobody gets hurt.
Are you sure, Mother?
I wasn't too rough, was I?
[Sonny] He used to work for Torus.
He still might.
We're the Bloc.
We don't kill civilians.
[Father] All right.
Looks like it's your lucky day, champ.
Take anything you can hock.
See if you can find some mask filters.
We're running out.
[sighs]
The Bloc needs your scrips, Ren.
I'd have given 'em to you.
[Hannah] I'll be back.
- [door closes] - [Brother] Hey.
So what's that thing do anyway?
Besides fry people.
It's just a science experiment.
[Father] That's right.
He used to be a military engineer for Torus.
[Brother] So is that a weapon or something?
- No, it's not a...
- [gunshot]
[Brother] Jesus Christ!
[gasps] [breathing heavily]
Ren?
- What the hell are you doing?
- [door bangs] [grunting]
[Father] You got five minutes.
- [Hannah] Who are they?
- You don't know?
- What?
- [chair dragging]
Shh.
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get us killed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
[sighs] Well, finally!
What happened to you after Torus tried to arrest me?
- I told you last night.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
Tell me again.
- Now?
Why?
- [door slides shut]
Ren, untie me.
What?
[typing]
Torus agents interrogated me for three days.
- [device beeping]
- Then what?
Uh, they let me go after they knew I had nothing to do with you stealing their scrips.
And that you left without telling me.
[Renton on earphone] Listen carefully.
Torus...
Hannah!
[Hannah] I got this!
- [metal clanking]
- Ren, un... untie me.
[typing]
What is it?
[sighs]
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?
Not just like that.
They took away my citizenship, our home.
They put me in a refugee camp for six months.
I didn't know if you were dead, or if you had just left me for dead.
I spent a year torturing myself, feeling guilty that I got away and you didn't.
They have a gun.
We should do what they say.
I already tried that.
[news anchor] Up north, Torus security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.
The refinery borders the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.
Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?
[Father] Know thy enemy, my brother.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.
[beeping]
[The Pope] Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
[grunts]
[Hannah] Are you okay?
Those guys hurt my back.
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, sure.
[Hannah groaning]
[moans]
[Renton grunts]
[Hannah groans]
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.
Then Torus seized the ARQ.
Now why take something that didn't work?
Because it does.
They want it back.
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
I know everything, Hannah.
Your boyfriend, stealing my scrips for the Bloc...
Mother.
How?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Are you really working for the Bloc, or did Torus turn you?
[sighs]
Bloc.
We don't want your stupid machine.
- We came for your scrips.
- Right.
Sorry.
You're a freedom fighter now.
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't.
Because you got away.
They kept the lights on while I tried to sleep.
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.
They played the same Christmas song over and over.
It never stopped.
I'm sorry.
You don't get to be sorry.
- You're too late for sorry.
- I never...
I never stopped thinking about you, Hannah.
I looked for you every day.
I hacked into every database I could, tapped every network, monitored every registry.
Finding you was the only thing that kept me going.
I still hate you.
Okay.
So you're just gonna kill us now?
- Just them.
- Ren, please.
Nobody has to get hurt.
We do it my way.
[indistinct chatter on holoprojector]
[The Pope] ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years...
- Jeez.
- What the hell you doing?
...before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[gun cocks]
Shoot me, we all die.
They're bluffing.
- [taser crackles] - [grunting]
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- [Father muffled] No, wait.
Hannah.
Come with me.
We can start over.
Okay?
Do it right this time.
We'll head north.
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.
[Father grunting]
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen.
Just...
Just think about it, okay?
[Father muffled] Hannah!
[Renton sighs]
Well... aren't we just one big happy family?
You killed me.
- [grunts] - [thuds]
You punched me in the ear.
I meant...
I meant to hit you in the face.
- Huh, like this?
- [grunts] [choking]
Hannah's coming with me.
[muffled grunting]
Giving us your blessing?
[grunts]
- [scoffs] She won't go with you.
- She will.
I know Hannah.
Then you also know that she hates you.
[yelling] [grunting]
- [taser crackling] - [Hannah] Stop!
[sighs]
[Renton] I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.
[Father] You can't go with him, Hannah.
His mind's gone sour.
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.
I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash...
I can't go with you.
I can't.
I'm keeping my scrips.
That wasn't the deal.
Well, the deal's changed.
Ren, please.
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.
The war is over.
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.
And you are wasting your time.
Maybe.
But I have to try.
[computer processing]
We need your scrips.
All of them.
Now!
You're not gonna shoot me.
You're right.
You're just being ridiculous.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just... [gunshot] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [gasping]
I shot you.
Wait, you remember?
[inaudible]
[clanging]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
[Renton] Oh, yeah.
All night long.
[Father] Give me your scrips.
But hold back on me?
You got five minutes.
- You do remember.
- [chair dragging] [stammers] Is this a dream?
It was a dream, right?
Or... is this a dream right now?
I...
- It's not a dream.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
- [sighs] No.
- Today is repeating.
[stammers] No, I have to get out of here.
- Ren, I can't.
I...
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
[cutting flex-cuffs]
How is this happening?
The ARQ.
How many times do you remember?
Just one.
[stammers] But it feels like more.
That's because it is.
Great.
Okay, you see these time logs?
These are the four loops we've gone through.
They always begin at 6:11 and end at 9:25.
And this last time log, that's happening right now.
So we've looped five times?
- Yeah.
- How?
Why?
[sighs]
Okay.
Okay, if, uh, this line is time, this is when the loop begins.
At 6:11 a.m., Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.
This caused forward time to bend back on itself, creating a closed-time loop.
And the day repeats.
Time resets every three hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds.
How does the ARQ work?
Um...
Okay.
I mean...
I mean, essentially, these fuel cells power the ARQ.
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.
It never needs an external power source, but... how it's looping time, I have no idea.
An unlimited energy machine that also produces unlimited time?
No wonder Torus wants it back.
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.
The loops always reset at 9:25.
What happened when the previous loop reset, shortly after you shot me?
- It was an accident.
- What happened?
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off, and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it.
That's all I remember.
Sonny probably shot you.
Or maybe your boyfriend.
Grimm wouldn't do that.
Do you love him?
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.
I owe him.
So he's the reason you joined up with the Bloc?
Five months in Torus custody was pretty convincing.
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.
I was angry.
But I also wanted to see you.
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.
Hannah, just come with me.
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc?
Come on.
You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis,
- but you just wanna run away.
- Yes, with you.
No, it's time we end this.
Fine.
Fine.
- Fine, shut down the ARQ.
- No.
No, not until we're in control.
If we shut down the ARQ and Sonny kills either one of us...
- We're dead for good.
- Which is why we need to kill them first.
No.
They're not murderers.
Sonny is.
He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.
Then I will make sure that he can't.
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.
Even Sonny?
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
- [flex-cuffs zipping]
- This is gonna work.
Just not too tight, okay?
Trust me.
[sighs] [computer processing] [sighs]
Hey, guys!
Get in here!
What's going on?
[Hannah] I know where his scrips are.
Untie me.
[clanging]
That was easy.
Does he have any more apples?
[cutting flex-cuffs]
[Sonny] So you broke cover?
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.
I want him to know the truth.
Say cheese, bud.
[safe beeps]
Check 'em.
All right, let's move.
I don't wanna be stuck in Torus territory after dark.
[Father] What about lover boy?
He's seen our faces.
No, he won't say anything.
[device beeping]
[Father] I guess it's your lucky day, champ.
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.
What about the Cuz killer?
We could probably strip it for parts?
Hey, genius.
What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.
[Brother] So that's why it's like a weapon or something?
We're taking it with us.
[muffled grunting]
What's it do?
- We'll find a use for it.
- [muffled grunting] [whispering] Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.
[gunshots]
[Renton grunting]
[muffled sobs]
She didn't tie your legs back up.
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?
Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.
Whatever the hell that is.
What's that thing run on, anyway?
Love.
My grams always used to say that love made the world go round.
But then, she was sick in the head with the kuru virus, so... [clears throat]
[Sonny] Mobius Common.
[Mobius Common] Identify yourself.
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
Stand by.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
[Sonny] Copy.
Out.
Did Torus promise your freedom if you found me?
You know they're lying, but I can help.
Is that the best you got?
- [electricity crackles]
- Oh.
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?
I use that?
What's the login?
What's the login?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Seriously?
Well, I guess that's romantic.
[grunting]
[Renton panting]
I get paid whether I bring you back dead or alive.
What's the login?
- You're running out of time.
- [chuckling]
- Is that the best you...
- [gunshot] [gasps] [breathing heavily] Hannah, wake up.
[Hannah gasps]
Sonny shot me.
- Sonny's a merc.
Torus sent him.
- Torus?
What do we do?
- Play along.
- [Hannah grunts] [grunting]
Did he just say "play along"?
I don't know.
I was asleep.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.
[Father] Cuz is dead.
He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.
[sighs] [banging]
[Hannah] Grimm.
- Did you fuck him?
- No.
The plan, remember?
- Get Renton to let his guard down.
- Yeah, but not your guard.
Stop it.
We fell asleep after talking all night.
That's it.
Then... what?
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.
We're not here to eat.
He has apples.
[Brother] Nobody has apples anymore.
[Father] He does.
[Brother sighs] Okay.
All right.
[device beeping]
[Father] Go on.
[clattering]
[Father] Were you brats playing doctor?
Just leave us alone.
[Father] Give me your scrips.
You got five minutes.
[whispering] You're not taking the ARQ.
[chair dragging]
- We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.
- [cutting flex-cuffs]
I don't trust him.
I don't even trust you right now.
Renton, if Sonny's a merc, we need all the help we can get.
[The Pope] The air is too toxic to breathe.
Our water, a poisonous ink.
Summer is cold.
Winter's hot.
And now that the birds are extinct, the only species left...
[Brother] You know, I heard this broadcast before.
- Must be a repeat.
- That's because Torus have her.
You got a real negative attitude, you know that?
[The Pope] ...what happened to continental Australia will happen to the entire planet.
It will be 10,000 years before anyone can step foot on that radioactive rubble again.
[Father] What's that?
Kerosene.
It's ours now.
Torus will plunder.
The company will consume until there's nothing left to consume.
Torus claims they're humanity's savior.
Take them true for what they really are, our executioner.
You cut that into four pieces?
So?
So there's three of us.
- Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
- Oh, don't say her name, dummy.
[muffled grunting]
[grunting continues]
Where'd he go?
[groans]
God!
He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.
- It was your idea.
- Yeah, well, you took too long.
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.
[Sonny] Nah, he's still in the house.
[Father] How do you know?
Hunch.
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement.
Go.
- We should stick together.
- [Hannah] Go.
- What are you doing?
- We need to kill Sonny.
[Brother whispering] Sonny?
Sonny?
[chuckles]
Don't look at me like that.
Why would Torus care about a few thousand scrips?
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.
What's special about this thing?
It's a time machine.
[grunts and thuds]
[Renton grunts]
[Hannah] At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted, which shorted the ARQ and caused time to loop.
- A time loop?
- Yes.
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.
- Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
- Some friend.
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.
[pounding on door]
[pounding continues]
Did you find him?
[sighs] No... but he killed Brother.
He's lying.
[Father] Where'd you get that?
[gunshot]
- Where is he?
- He's gone.
Aw, and he left you here all alone?
No.
Renton only cares about himself.
And the ARQ.
[grunting]
- [taser crackles] - [Sonny yelling]
[panting] [panting]
[sighs]
Is it over?
Let's shut this damn thing down.
Is the ARQ spinning faster?
I have no idea.
[typing]
September 19th.
That was the last time we saw each other.
If I could relive one day,
I'd...
[Father choking]
[Hannah] Grimm.
Oh, my God.
He's alive.
Grimm.
Grimm, look at me.
Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.
[stammers] Get a first aid kit or something!
[softly] Okay.
[gunshot]
- [Renton grunting] - [sighs]
[gasps]
Fuck!
[gasps]
Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- Stand back.
We don't have air masks.
[gunshots in distance]
[device beeping]
[door slides shut]
- Why is this loop different?
- Sonny's aware of the time loops.
- Sonny's aware, how?
- I don't know.
How did you become aware?
- I just woke up and remembered.
- Me, too.
[typing]
- So is remembering just random?
- [Renton] No.
No, no, no, no.
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that could affect memory.
[Hannah] We're farthest away from the ARQ when it resets.
Yeah, which is why the effect wore off on us first.
[Hannah] And now Sonny.
Shit.
[Renton] Data's still the same.
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.
[stammers] Why doesn't the data also reset?
The time logs are housed in the ARQ's core structure, above the... fuel cells.
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's when the power source runs out.
When the... the fuel cells go dead?
When the loop resets, the fuel cells are still charged.
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?
Shit.
We stop Sonny before he calls in the ZMPs.
No sign of Sonny.
We should go while we have the chance.
- And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
- Oh, come on.
- Just hear me out.
- No.
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ, they'll be able to loop back in time and fight again... until they get it right, until we win.
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.
But if Torus gets the ARQ... they'll be unstoppable.
Torus can't get the ARQ, but neither can the Bloc.
You would rather keep it to yourself.
You haven't changed.
- Still selfish and...
- I'm selfish?
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.
Then what are you fighting for?
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.
Then trust me.
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him...
He won't.
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.
How?
Enter the self-destruct prompt into the user ID.
It'll wipe the system, melt the circuit boards, the cylinder will spin out of control.
Everything will be lost.
What's the prompt?
- This is a last resort.
- I know.
What's the prompt?
Just before we were separated, I gave you a code word.
- You mean before you left me.
- Do you remember?
I remember you acting paranoid.
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.
Sky.
[whirring]
[taser crackling]
Hannah, open the door!
Hannah!
You checked the wrong pocket.
- Mobius Common.
- [Mobius Common] Identify yourself.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
[Sonny] Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.
Request recon crush-down for Operation Riverrun.
Over.
Triangulating coordinates.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Oh, you got that right.
I was ordered to recover an energy turbine.
Apparently, it's a time machine.
ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.
Drop time imminent.
Copy.
Out.
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.
Like you are to the Bloc?
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill millions more than they already have.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time.
Yeah.
Because of people like you.
You misunderstand me.
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.
So you're giving the ARQ to the bastards who started the war.
Better that someone wins than everybody dies.

Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.
You should have destroyed it.
And let you die?

Cyanide did this?
[Renton] No.
Sonny did this.

No.
No, he probably did this just to slow us down.
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.
Okay, I'll download the data and dismantle the ARQ.
And take it to the Bloc.

I don't even know what's real anymore, and what is...
We'll just figure it out, because you're real to me.
You know, if there's anything I can do to help...
- Cal came and got me.
- You're here.
He said this is where I'm supposed to be.
They are trying to kill me, and they will kill you.
Come on, Alison.
Come back with me.
Go!
- I want you to take the walk.
- Steve's walk?
If you don't do the walk, I will tell Sarah everything.
I'll tell her you don't believe.
When did you know about...
you always hear the elders talking about the moment when they felt it, The Light.
Closest thing to it, when I met your mom.
- Stop.
- You know, she can just...
What's going on?
- Lift all my doubts.
- And he's lying to you.
We can never allow fear to limit the work of our spirits.
Your words...
And you said to me often when I was growing up... you said it again the day of your... your diagnosis.
"Don't let The Movement die.
You're the only one I can trust to keep it alive."
I've tried to fulfill your wishes.
I'm trying to be your son.
I wrote the rungs.
I tried to channel you.
But if... if you're unhappy with me, please tell me, 'cause there won't be another chance.
I'm sorry for everything...
I have done that is wrong and everything wrong...
I do next.
But you weren't supposed to die.
I don't know what you're thinking, but we're not having an affair.
Why did he call you 22 times in the last three months?
It's not my place to say.
Your husband left a journal.
- What?
- I took his file, and the journal was in it.
Where is it?
They found it in the room that he was staying at in Peru.
Why wasn't it given to the police?
I think you'll understand when you read it.
Your husband was having doubts.
Doubts?
About the Movement.
He realized it was bullshit and didn't know what to do.
At least he's alive, and he loves you, enough to walk that fucking walk, enough to drink the fucking juice.
So what?
He doesn't believe there's a ladder in the sky.
Get over yourself.
What's Mom gonna make for dinner?
I hope it's veggie chili.
Oh, and with cornbread?
Oh.
Oh, my God.
- With butter?
- Yes.
I am going to eat a stick of butter.
Look.
Wow.
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.
What if she kicks me out?
I will not let that happen.
All right?
Come on.
Ah.
If she ends up not making veggie chili, can you make veggie chili?
What's going on?
I need your help.
I started taking this when you were gone.
Luckily it hasn't been very long, so withdrawal should only take a couple of days and I've gotten off worse stuff.
- Where did you get this?
- I can't tell you.
- Mary.
- Are you gonna help me or not?
Let's just go to the nurse.
We'll do this the right way.
It has to be this way.
- Hey, they're back.
- I see them.
- Hey.
- Check it out, Hawk, man.
What's up?
Tell us everything.
Look at this guy, with a beard.
I do not have a beard.
Oh, I see it.
It's right there.
Oh, Grandpa is gonna kick himself.
He's doing outreach in Vermont.
Good to see you, my friend.
I don't have a beard.
Mm.
I know about Alison.
So how did you find out?
I found your phone.
Then you spoke with Alison?
So what happens now?
Now?
I don't know, Eddie.
I mean, now that you've been lying to me for months, now that I called Miranda Frank a fucking whore, now that I thought that I was going crazy because I knew... because I knew something was wrong.
But I trusted you.
I know.
Look, I know.
I just...
I didn't know what to do.
How about tell me the fucking truth?
Yeah, but then you would put me in a cell to be reprogrammed.
Maybe that would have helped.
No, it wouldn't have.
Well, things are pretty fucked up now.
Yeah, maybe, but at least you're here talking to me, your husband, and not some pod person.
Oh, I'm a pod person?
Is that what you're saying?
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm saying I would have been if you sent me in a room to be brainwashed.
What are you talking about?
Don't touch me.
I don't even know who you are.
Hey.
Hey.
I am the same person.
Okay?
I love you.
I love our family.
I believe in the work that we do.
Okay?
But the rest is just fucking fairy tales.
You're talking about everything... everything in my soul.
Oh, Jesus, Sarah.
Who gives a shit?
I mean, how many people eat a fucking cracker and really believe that it's the body of Christ?
I don't give a shit what other people do.
I am not other people, and we are not other people.
All right.
I realized on the walk we are what matters.
We're all that matters.
We're a part of something that matters, and we matter because we are a part of it.
You don't actually believe that.
You don't know me.
I am very sorry about my outburst last week.
I'm gonna be completely calm and ask you, please, don't take me off this case.
It has nothing to do with me.
I can't make that call and you know it.
You and I both know that the IRS is gonna sit on this for years.
These people killed a doctor.
- It was a suicide.
- I don't think so.
They take innocent people... broken people... they lure them in and they don't let them leave.
When's your daughter's surgery?
It's, uh, next week.
Take a couple of weeks off.
Spend time with your family.
You know what?
This movement is gonna get more powerful.
They have a new leader, and he's very charismatic, very ambitious.
You let this sit for months...
Rindge, Hondurans... that'll be small potatoes.
The other choice is you're suspended.
I'll see you in two weeks, Abe.
Hey.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, yeah.
First I want to apologize.
For letting me believe my husband fucked Miranda Frank?
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me what you knew?
- I don't know exactly...
- I do.
Made you feel powerful knowing everything while I walked around like a deer in headlights.
No.
No, that's not true, Sarah.
I-I didn't know everything at first, and I was torn.
You know, I wanted to wait until I did, and it killed me not to tell you.
You know I...
Is there something else?
Yeah.
Steve finished the rungs.
- That means...
- That means he's leaving us.
- When?
- Soon.
Well, is he gonna come here?
Is he gonna say good-bye?
I don't know.
I...
I'm gonna tell everyone Steve's plan at Friday's meeting of the Upper Rungs.
Uh, there's something else.
Um... he wants you to help shape the next phase of The Movement with me.
He wants us to be Guardians of The Light... together.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
Let's go somewhere.
Okay.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Um...
We're living in my mom's car.
I mean, Zak isn't... he's staying at a friend's house... but me and my mom...
I can help.
I can...
How?
I can drop out of school, get a job.
- I mean, I can always go back.
- That's crazy.
You can't do that for me.
I mean, what about your parents?
I'm leaving The Movement.
I decided while I was on the walk.
No, this is your entire life.
Not anymore.
You're my life now.
I want to give a warm welcome back to Eddie Lane, who completed the walk yesterday after ten days on the road.
Um...
You know, um, the first thing I found on the walk is that you do not do the walk in the middle of winter.
Um...
You know, everyone says that they have these big moments on the walk.
They, uh, they see truth.
Um...
Truth is, um,
I didn't.
You know, I saw a lot of... a lot of highway, broken bottles, broken people, um, kind people, fast food wrappers, and, uh, and road kill.
You know, the whole time, I was thinking,
"How fast can I get home?"
So I guess that's what I...
I found.
No matter where I am, I just want to be... just want to be home with my... my wife and my kids.
They are my Truth.
Um...
That's all I got.
Thanks.
Hey.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
Here.
- Ow, shit!
- Hey, hey.
- I'm sorry.
- Just...
Come here.
Let me see it.
It's fine.
Come here.
You okay?
It's hard to eat.
Stomach's not so great.
What is up with her?
You know what?
I'm gonna say something.
Please don't.
Hey, what's your problem?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
It's nothing.
Please, forget it.
No, look, I'm tired of all these dirty looks.
- What did she ever do to you?
- Why don't you ask her?
- What is she talking about?
- Nothing.
I didn't do anything.
Just forget it.
Come on.
She fucked me.
That's what she did.
- What?
- Sean, please...
Is she using you for drugs too?
- Is that true?
- That's all she wants, and we're the idiots who think we're saving her.
She's a junkie and a liar, and...
Hey, no, Mary!
No, Mary!
Hey.
Hey.
What is going on here?
That is not cool.
No way.
My man.
Yeah?
Hey, Sam, it's, uh, Eddie Lane.
Yeah, what?
Um... hey, I noticed that you haven't been to gathering in the past few weeks and I just wanted to check in, see if everything was okay.
No.
Everything's not okay.
What's going on?
You know, well, my daughter's about to check into St. Michael's and get her chest cut open.
That's one thing, and I might have lost my job.
Oh.
Um, I am so sorry, Sam.
Yeah, I bet you are.
And I'm the perfect recruit right now, right?
On my last leg?
That's how you guys like 'em.
You know, we... we really do help a lot of people.
Man, you know why I didn't go to gathering?
Because it's bullshit.
You people are bullshit.
Your Light is not going to help my kid get better, so please just stop fucking calling me, okay?
Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I, uh, I won't call you again.
But listen,
I truly believe that your kid is going to be fine, but you need to believe that too, all right?
Forget The Light.
Okay?
Fuck The Light.
Just do not give up on your kid, all right?
Sam.
So you, uh...
I was lonely.
I really liked her, and I thought she really liked me.
I'm sure.
Steve understood the challenges of bringing together a community of people with deep wounds.
That's why we have to forgive.
That's the only way to heal.
Why don't you take a week in rehab, Betsy?
It'll do you good.
I'll talk to Richard.
I know how hard this must be for you.
I know you came to us full of heartbreak.
But perhaps this is what The Light is giving in return.
Steve believes that committing to another human being's wounds, past, present, and future, is a great challenge but also the most rewarding experience one can have in this life.
That's why marriage is a cornerstone of The Movement.
If you forgive me, I want that... that challenge.
With you.
I kept thinking when I was walking, we know nothing.
Nothing of suffering.
You know, we may walk 250 miles with no money and, yeah, our feet hurt and we see poverty and pain, but nothing compared to how people in other countries live.
We're in our own backyard.
I mean, for us, it'll end.
We will finish the walk and end up in our comfy beds.
What about you, Hawk?
Um...
I-I don't know.
You don't know?
What did you miss?
Probably my comfy bed.
Uncle Cal kept it warm for you.
What?
He was sick... body sick, so he slept in Hawk's bed.
- Really?
- Yes.
- What was he sick with?
- Uh, guys...
And he's not your uncle.
Eddie.
I just want to make that clear.
He is not your family.
This is your family.
- Stop it.
- I'm leaving.
While I was on the walk,
I decided, and I gave this a lot of thought, and I'm not gonna take my vows when I'm 16.
I'm gonna stay in high school.
Well, then you won't talk to me or your sister or anyone in your family again.
- Mom.
- Sarah.
But Dad said I could.
He said it would be okay.
Well, Dad lied.
Eat.
There are people suffering tonight.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
Where are you gonna sleep?
I was just homeless.
I can keep doing it.
You are not gonna be homeless.
- Let him go.
- What?
- Let him go.
- Sarah.
Hawk.
Hawk!
This is crazy.
He's a 15-year-old kid.
Where is Hawk going?
He's fine, honey, I promise you.
Sarah.
You were supposed to talk sense into him.
Why do you think I let him go on the walk?
But you couldn't do that, could you?
'Cause you were too busy deciding whether or not you wanted to stay yourself.
Come on, honey, I don't want to be late.
So, that is what is going on.
Oh.
Sarah didn't tell you any of this?
What do you want, Eddie?
Look, I just...
I want...
I want some help.
Okay, I need you to talk some sense into her.
Oh.
I mean, you lost a kid.
You know what this is like.
You need to get into a program.
I can take you there right now.
Gaby, call Richard.
Tell him I'll bring Eddie in.
No, hey, hey.
I'm not doing a program.
Program won't work for him.
- It has to.
- He's gone.
I am not gone.
I'm right here.
We have to try.
He's our son-in-law.
Not anymore.

"Weird." It's weird.
You tell me how a guy burns his hands like this falling off a mountain.
Anyway, I thought you'd want to see it.
- My man.
- My man.
Hawk's back.
- Hey.
- Ah.
Hey.
What's going on, kid?
Hey, hey.
Talk to me.
Could you just give us a second, Summer?
Hey.
Ashley broke up with me.
Come here.
Come here, come here.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
It's like one moment,
I'm the most important thing in the world, and the next time... too much responsibility.
What's too much responsibility?
Me.
Giving up my life for her.
Look, she's just going through a lot with her family right now, all right?
Yeah.
And she kept going on and on about how I was special because Meyerism is special.
She doesn't even like Meyerism.
It made no sense.
She...
- What?
- She said Meyerism was the part of me that mattered and that she didn't want to take that away.
Watch your sister.
We will present it all at our next gathering.
Then... then we will celebrate, because Steve will be here.
Steve is...
Steve's coming?
Eddie, thank you for coming.
What did you do to get Ashley to break up with Hawk?
- You had him do it?
- Eddie...
Fuck you, Cal.
You broke your son's heart.
It was for the best.
It was for the best?
What, so he can end up like you?
All of you?
Just a prisoner.
A bunch of fucking prisoners.
Okay, Eddie, let's go.
Come on.
You're okay.
Come on.
Cal, are you all right?
Evening.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Previously on "The Path"...
I don't even know what's real anymore, and what is...
We'll just figure it out, because you're real to me.
You know, if there's anything I can do to help...
- Cal came and got me.
- You're here.
He said this is where I'm supposed to be.
They are trying to kill me, and they will kill you.
Come on, Alison.
Come back with me.
Go!
- I want you to take the walk.
- Steve's walk?
If you don't do the walk, I will tell Sarah everything.
I'll tell her you don't believe.
When did you know about...
you always hear the elders talking about the moment when they felt it, The Light.
Closest thing to it, when I met your mom.
- Stop.
- You know, she can just...
What's going on?
- Lift all my doubts.
- And he's lying to you.
We can never allow fear to limit the work of our spirits.
Your words...
And you said to me often when I was growing up... you said it again the day of your... your diagnosis.
"Don't let The Movement die.
You're the only one I can trust to keep it alive."
I've tried to fulfill your wishes.
I'm trying to be your son.
I wrote the rungs.
I tried to channel you.
But if... if you're unhappy with me, please tell me, 'cause there won't be another chance.
I'm sorry for everything...
I have done that is wrong and everything wrong...
I do next.
But you weren't supposed to die.
I don't know what you're thinking, but we're not having an affair.
Why did he call you 22 times in the last three months?
It's not my place to say.
Your husband left a journal.
- What?
- I took his file, and the journal was in it.
Where is it?
They found it in the room that he was staying at in Peru.
Why wasn't it given to the police?
I think you'll understand when you read it.
Your husband was having doubts.
Doubts?
About the Movement.
He realized it was bullshit and didn't know what to do.
At least he's alive, and he loves you, enough to walk that fucking walk, enough to drink the fucking juice.
So what?
He doesn't believe there's a ladder in the sky.
Get over yourself.
What's Mom gonna make for dinner?
I hope it's veggie chili.
Oh, and with cornbread?
Oh.
Oh, my God.
- With butter?
- Yes.
I am going to eat a stick of butter.
Look.
Wow.
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.
What if she kicks me out?
I will not let that happen.
All right?
Come on.
Ah.
If she ends up not making veggie chili, can you make veggie chili?
What's going on?
I need your help.
I started taking this when you were gone.
Luckily it hasn't been very long, so withdrawal should only take a couple of days and I've gotten off worse stuff.
- Where did you get this?
- I can't tell you.
- Mary.
- Are you gonna help me or not?
Let's just go to the nurse.
We'll do this the right way.
It has to be this way.
- Hey, they're back.
- I see them.
- Hey.
- Check it out, Hawk, man.
What's up?
Tell us everything.
Look at this guy, with a beard.
I do not have a beard.
Oh, I see it.
It's right there.
Oh, Grandpa is gonna kick himself.
He's doing outreach in Vermont.
Good to see you, my friend.
I don't have a beard.
Mm.
I know about Alison.
So how did you find out?
I found your phone.
Then you spoke with Alison?
So what happens now?
Now?
I don't know, Eddie.
I mean, now that you've been lying to me for months, now that I called Miranda Frank a fucking whore, now that I thought that I was going crazy because I knew... because I knew something was wrong.
But I trusted you.
I know.
Look, I know.
I just...
I didn't know what to do.
How about tell me the fucking truth?
Yeah, but then you would put me in a cell to be reprogrammed.
Maybe that would have helped.
No, it wouldn't have.
Well, things are pretty fucked up now.
Yeah, maybe, but at least you're here talking to me, your husband, and not some pod person.
Oh, I'm a pod person?
Is that what you're saying?
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm saying I would have been if you sent me in a room to be brainwashed.
What are you talking about?
Don't touch me.
I don't even know who you are.
Hey.
Hey.
I am the same person.
Okay?
I love you.
I love our family.
I believe in the work that we do.
Okay?
But the rest is just fucking fairy tales.
You're talking about everything... everything in my soul.
Oh, Jesus, Sarah.
Who gives a shit?
I mean, how many people eat a fucking cracker and really believe that it's the body of Christ?
I don't give a shit what other people do.
I am not other people, and we are not other people.
All right.
I realized on the walk we are what matters.
We're all that matters.
We're a part of something that matters, and we matter because we are a part of it.
You don't actually believe that.
You don't know me.
I am very sorry about my outburst last week.
I'm gonna be completely calm and ask you, please, don't take me off this case.
It has nothing to do with me.
I can't make that call and you know it.
You and I both know that the IRS is gonna sit on this for years.
These people killed a doctor.
- It was a suicide.
- I don't think so.
They take innocent people... broken people... they lure them in and they don't let them leave.
When's your daughter's surgery?
It's, uh, next week.
Take a couple of weeks off.
Spend time with your family.
You know what?
This movement is gonna get more powerful.
They have a new leader, and he's very charismatic, very ambitious.
You let this sit for months...
Rindge, Hondurans... that'll be small potatoes.
The other choice is you're suspended.
I'll see you in two weeks, Abe.
Hey.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, yeah.
First I want to apologize.
For letting me believe my husband fucked Miranda Frank?
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me what you knew?
- I don't know exactly...
- I do.
Made you feel powerful knowing everything while I walked around like a deer in headlights.
No.
No, that's not true, Sarah.
I-I didn't know everything at first, and I was torn.
You know, I wanted to wait until I did, and it killed me not to tell you.
You know I...
Is there something else?
Yeah.
Steve finished the rungs.
- That means...
- That means he's leaving us.
- When?
- Soon.
Well, is he gonna come here?
Is he gonna say good-bye?
I don't know.
I...
I'm gonna tell everyone Steve's plan at Friday's meeting of the Upper Rungs.
Uh, there's something else.
Um... he wants you to help shape the next phase of The Movement with me.
He wants us to be Guardians of The Light... together.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
Let's go somewhere.
Okay.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Um...
We're living in my mom's car.
I mean, Zak isn't... he's staying at a friend's house... but me and my mom...
I can help.
I can...
How?
I can drop out of school, get a job.
- I mean, I can always go back.
- That's crazy.
You can't do that for me.
I mean, what about your parents?
I'm leaving The Movement.
I decided while I was on the walk.
No, this is your entire life.
Not anymore.
You're my life now.
I want to give a warm welcome back to Eddie Lane, who completed the walk yesterday after ten days on the road.
Um...
You know, um, the first thing I found on the walk is that you do not do the walk in the middle of winter.
Um...
You know, everyone says that they have these big moments on the walk.
They, uh, they see truth.
Um...
Truth is, um,
I didn't.
You know, I saw a lot of... a lot of highway, broken bottles, broken people, um, kind people, fast food wrappers, and, uh, and road kill.
You know, the whole time, I was thinking,
"How fast can I get home?"
So I guess that's what I...
I found.
No matter where I am, I just want to be... just want to be home with my... my wife and my kids.
They are my Truth.
Um...
That's all I got.
Thanks.
Hey.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
Here.
- Ow, shit!
- Hey, hey.
- I'm sorry.
- Just...
Come here.
Let me see it.
It's fine.
Come here.
You okay?
It's hard to eat.
Stomach's not so great.
What is up with her?
You know what?
I'm gonna say something.
Please don't.
Hey, what's your problem?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
It's nothing.
Please, forget it.
No, look, I'm tired of all these dirty looks.
- What did she ever do to you?
- Why don't you ask her?
- What is she talking about?
- Nothing.
I didn't do anything.
Just forget it.
Come on.
She fucked me.
That's what she did.
- What?
- Sean, please...
Is she using you for drugs too?
- Is that true?
- That's all she wants, and we're the idiots who think we're saving her.
She's a junkie and a liar, and...
Hey, no, Mary!
No, Mary!
Hey.
Hey.
What is going on here?
That is not cool.
No way.
My man.
Yeah?
Hey, Sam, it's, uh, Eddie Lane.
Yeah, what?
Um... hey, I noticed that you haven't been to gathering in the past few weeks and I just wanted to check in, see if everything was okay.
No.
Everything's not okay.
What's going on?
You know, well, my daughter's about to check into St. Michael's and get her chest cut open.
That's one thing, and I might have lost my job.
Oh.
Um, I am so sorry, Sam.
Yeah, I bet you are.
And I'm the perfect recruit right now, right?
On my last leg?
That's how you guys like 'em.
You know, we... we really do help a lot of people.
Man, you know why I didn't go to gathering?
Because it's bullshit.
You people are bullshit.
Your Light is not going to help my kid get better, so please just stop fucking calling me, okay?
Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I, uh, I won't call you again.
But listen,
I truly believe that your kid is going to be fine, but you need to believe that too, all right?
Forget The Light.
Okay?
Fuck The Light.
Just do not give up on your kid, all right?
Sam.
So you, uh...
I was lonely.
I really liked her, and I thought she really liked me.
I'm sure.
Steve understood the challenges of bringing together a community of people with deep wounds.
That's why we have to forgive.
That's the only way to heal.
Why don't you take a week in rehab, Betsy?
It'll do you good.
I'll talk to Richard.
I know how hard this must be for you.
I know you came to us full of heartbreak.
But perhaps this is what The Light is giving in return.
Steve believes that committing to another human being's wounds, past, present, and future, is a great challenge but also the most rewarding experience one can have in this life.
That's why marriage is a cornerstone of The Movement.
If you forgive me, I want that... that challenge.
With you.
I kept thinking when I was walking, we know nothing.
Nothing of suffering.
You know, we may walk 250 miles with no money and, yeah, our feet hurt and we see poverty and pain, but nothing compared to how people in other countries live.
We're in our own backyard.
I mean, for us, it'll end.
We will finish the walk and end up in our comfy beds.
What about you, Hawk?
Um...
I-I don't know.
You don't know?
What did you miss?
Probably my comfy bed.
Uncle Cal kept it warm for you.
What?
He was sick... body sick, so he slept in Hawk's bed.
- Really?
- Yes.
- What was he sick with?
- Uh, guys...
And he's not your uncle.
Eddie.
I just want to make that clear.
He is not your family.
This is your family.
- Stop it.
- I'm leaving.
While I was on the walk,
I decided, and I gave this a lot of thought, and I'm not gonna take my vows when I'm 16.
I'm gonna stay in high school.
Well, then you won't talk to me or your sister or anyone in your family again.
- Mom.
- Sarah.
But Dad said I could.
He said it would be okay.
Well, Dad lied.
Eat.
There are people suffering tonight.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
Where are you gonna sleep?
I was just homeless.
I can keep doing it.
You are not gonna be homeless.
- Let him go.
- What?
- Let him go.
- Sarah.
Hawk.
Hawk!
This is crazy.
He's a 15-year-old kid.
Where is Hawk going?
He's fine, honey, I promise you.
Sarah.
You were supposed to talk sense into him.
Why do you think I let him go on the walk?
But you couldn't do that, could you?
'Cause you were too busy deciding whether or not you wanted to stay yourself.
Come on, honey, I don't want to be late.
So, that is what is going on.
Oh.
Sarah didn't tell you any of this?
What do you want, Eddie?
Look, I just...
I want...
I want some help.
Okay, I need you to talk some sense into her.
Oh.
I mean, you lost a kid.
You know what this is like.
You need to get into a program.
I can take you there right now.
Gaby, call Richard.
Tell him I'll bring Eddie in.
No, hey, hey.
I'm not doing a program.
Program won't work for him.
- It has to.
- He's gone.
I am not gone.
I'm right here.
We have to try.
He's our son-in-law.
Not anymore.
There's got to be some fucking room for doubt.
That's what's caused the world to be in such shit shape.
You'll lose everyone.
People who lack conviction.
Cowards.
- Can I take your coat for you?
- Thank you.
Can I get you a drink?
Amelia.
Gibson.
- Cal Roberts.
- Well?
I-I don't drink.
What do you do, Cal Roberts?
Cal.
I'm glad you called.
John.
Um...
Uh...
Good to meet you, Amelia.
Next time.
I love this place.
So, I called you a dozen times.
What made you finally decide to forgive me for having the shit beat out of you?
Um, how's Freddie?
Totally new kid.
Back in school.
Art school, but you can't have everything.
Want a drink?
No, just water.
John, I'd like you to help me with something.
I see.
The answer to my question.
You're forgiving because you found a way for me to make it up to you.
That's right.
I want to do for hundreds of people... no, thousands of people what we did for your son.
We've got the manpower, we've got dozens of young people that want to get out there, get on the ground, make a difference.
- How much you looking for?
- No,
I'm not here to ask for money.
I've got money.
I've got money pouring in.
People believe in us, they want to contribute, but we're still in the Dark Ages.
We might as well have our money under a mattress.
We need stability.
You want me to handle your investments.
I want expansion.
I want real estate, and all over the world, and offshore accounts, tax shelters.
I see.
We can set up a meeting, talk with some of your higher-ranking members.
Well, I don't see why we need to involve anyone else.
Our leadership structure is evolving.
I'll be taking the more active role.
All right.
Let's see what we're looking at here.
Silas, it's Sarah.
Are you there?
I've been calling you for days.
I imagine you're on one of your journeys.
I hope you come back soon.
I...
I need your counsel.
Sarah.
What are you doing out here?
It's freezing.
Come on.
Why are you wearing a tie?
Oh, no, no, no.
Shh.
Hawk.
He's leaving us.
That's unacceptable.
Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me.
Hey, Ashley.
I'm a friend of Hawk's family.
Yeah, I remember you from, like, the church or whatever you call it.
Can I talk to you about something?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Well, actually, there's something
I'd like to show you, and then I'll drop you wherever you want to go afterwards.
Come on.
What are we doing here?
I left the heat on.
Warm it up for you.
Whose house is this?
Yours.
It belongs to a member.
They're working in San Diego for the next 18 months, so it's empty.
Your mother won't know it's ours.
I could see you at that desk, studying, college applications.
Where do you want to go?
Uh, NYU.
Oh, yeah, I'll bet you'll get in.
Scholarship.
You just need a room of your own, right?
Everyone does.
Why are you doing this?
Um, I need to ask you a favor.
I need you ask you to really put some thought into what's going on with you and Hawk.
I knew it.
Because he... he loves you, enough to give up everything.
He wants to leave.
Because he met you.
Come on.
That's why I really...
I really want you to understand what leaving will mean for him.
Hawk... he grew up a Meyerist, and if he leaves, he will lose his faith.
And there's, uh... there's something worse.
Um...
And this you'll understand all too well.
If Hawk walks away, he doesn't just lose his faith, he loses his family.
His mother.
His father.
His sister.
His grandparents.
His cousins.
Now, you know what it is to lose a parent, Ashley.
It is... boundless fucking grief.
Imagine losing your whole family.
And, yes,
Hawk may come to this decision anyway, someday, but...
Is he ready to come to it now?
Steve has finished writing the last three rungs...
And you have my word, they are revolutionary.
Now, the Movement is about to undergo tremendous change, and this is the place where it'll happen.
- Babe.
- Yeah?
Hello.
Hey, Fredericks.
So, hey.
What brings you to this ends of the earth, huh?
That coroner report from Peru, Jason Kemp.
- I'm off the case.
- Yeah, I know.
You want some coffee?
Or a beer?
No, my lady's in the car.
Date night.
Mm.
It's that good, huh?
I don't know about "good."
"Weird." It's weird.
You tell me how a guy burns his hands like this falling off a mountain.
Anyway, I thought you'd want to see it.
- My man.
- My man.
Hawk's back.
- Hey.
- Ah.
Hey.
What's going on, kid?
Hey, hey.
Talk to me.
Could you just give us a second, Summer?
Hey.
Ashley broke up with me.
Come here.
Come here, come here.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
It's like one moment,
I'm the most important thing in the world, and the next time... too much responsibility.
What's too much responsibility?
Me.
Giving up my life for her.
Look, she's just going through a lot with her family right now, all right?
Yeah.
And she kept going on and on about how I was special because Meyerism is special.
She doesn't even like Meyerism.
It made no sense.
She...
- What?
- She said Meyerism was the part of me that mattered and that she didn't want to take that away.
Watch your sister.
We will present it all at our next gathering.
Then... then we will celebrate, because Steve will be here.
Steve is...
Steve's coming?
Eddie, thank you for coming.
What did you do to get Ashley to break up with Hawk?
- You had him do it?
- Eddie...
Fuck you, Cal.
You broke your son's heart.
It was for the best.
It was for the best?
What, so he can end up like you?
All of you?
Just a prisoner.
A bunch of fucking prisoners.
Okay, Eddie, let's go.
Come on.
You're okay.
Come on.
Cal, are you all right?
Evening.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Adult Adam:
Back in the '80s, all the best TV shows featured a cool vehicle.
Airwolf was a badass chopper.
Street Hawk tore it up on a cycle.
But my favorite was K.I.T.T. from "Knight Rider"...
A turbo-boosted talking super car!
I was so obsessed,
I even made my own version of K.I.T.T., and I named it G.I.T.T.!
Oh, no, G.I.T.T.!
The evil corporate types are chasing us in that armored truck!
What the hell did you do to my station wagon?
Isn't it great?
I turned it into G.I.T.T., which stands for Goldberg Industries Turbo Transport!
Well, you're a moron, which stands for moron, moron.
That doesn't work as an acronym.
Even though Hollywood seemed millions of miles away from Jenkintown, as fate would have it,
TV's coolest car was about to roll into my life!
Holy K.I.T.T.
Mom, I am coming to you with an urgent request, 'cause you understand the hopes and dreams of a sensitive, artistic boy.
What is it, Love Bug?
Tell Mama.
I want to go see K.I.T.T. in the Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade.
I'm not driving you anywhere on Thanksgiving.
Please, Mama.
Make the awful man take me to see the thing I love.
Sweetie, I would never deprive my delicious little schmoopster of anything his heart desires.
Yes!
In your face, guy who's gonna drive me to fun!
However, it is Thanksgiving...
It's the one day a year when we gather together as a family and appreciate the feast that I've been working on for months.
In your face.
Fine, forget your car!
I've got my own set of wheels, and I will make it downtown!
This was so much cooler when I was 7.
♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪
♪ But nonetheless, I feel the need to say ♪
♪ I don't know the future ♪
♪ But the past keeps getting clearer every day ♪
It was Thanksgiving, 1980-something, and the Goldbergs' turkey day traditions were in full swing... which meant a visit from my uncle Marvin.
Freeze, turkeys!
That's right.
Thanksgiving got a little bit safer.
Now that Officer Goldberg is on the case!
Oh, my God!
I know a cop now.
Okay, don't get sucked in.
He's not a real cop.
He's just an idiot that works in a mall.
Actually, Mur-Man, for the record, I'm more than a cop.
I'm above the law.
The laws don't apply to me.
I'm like The Equalizer or Batman!
Both of which aren't real...
Just like your badge.
Does this look not real to you?
We got a 10-50 at the Goldberg residence, please respond.
Cool!
What's a 10-50?
A homicide.
Murder?
!
Isn't HQ gonna respond?
!
No, they can tell by the tone of my voice
I'm just having a little fun.
Awesome!
Do you have a gun?
Nope, I'm not allowed!
But... there's no rules against this!
This my little potato gun.
I had it made special.
It may not look like much, but at close range, it'll take out a rhino.
Get that thing out of here before you hurt someone, you moron!
That's it!
As an officer of the Gallery Mall,
I will not be disrespected this way.
I'm storming out!
No.
No.
No.
There will be no storming this year, do you hear me?
We are going to eat together as a family with no drama, understand?
Psht!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Okay.
Oh!
Here's the story.
Oh!
Barry came at me...
He was out of control.
You're gonna have to stab me in the arm...
That was awesome!
Oh, my God, you're alive!
Come here.
Amazingly, the potato gun wasn't the craziest thing to happen that holiday.
It was a revelation that would change my mom forever.
Mom, I have a huge announcement.
I just read "Diet for a Small Planet,"
and I am officially a vegetarian.
No, you're not.
Get out of here.
Not that stupid thing...
This.
Okay, I'm heading out.
See you at 9:00 when Thanksgiving is over.
What?
Lainey's dad invited me to their big dinner, and I'm going, even though I know what you're gonna say...
"My name is Mom, and this is the most important day of the year for me."
Ha!
That's totally her!
Actually, I wasn't gonna say that at all.
You can go to Lainey's for Thanksgiving if that's what you want.
Really?
You go have fun.
I'll just be here doing my mom thang.
Hey, there, guess what.
You're invited to our Thanksgiving.
The invitation is just a formality.
You're coming...
No, it's not an option.
Well, thanks, but we kind of have our own thing...
Okay, it's settled.
Yay!
I'll see you in a few.
Don't bring any food.
I'm closing the door, shutting off all communication, okay?
- Yay again!
- No, I didn't...
While my mom was forcing Bill and Lainey to our Thanksgiving, my dad was forced to spend quality time with his brother.
When we get close enough,
I want you to triangulate the source.
We should be close enough now.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is this?
It's a show about a talking car that Adam loves.
Pretty silly, isn't it?
Well, yeah, but I-I got to admit,
I'm digging this guy's style.
All right, give me a visual on the license plate.
Good idea.
Whoo-hoo!
You're so right!
The man oozes cool.
Adult Adam:
And then, for the first time in ages, my dad and Uncle Marvin actually had something in common.
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
Unexpectedly, Thanksgiving became a thing of joy for them.
Yahtzee!
We'll just watch one more.
Or two.
Or three.
Just to pass the time.
Since I was a geek who had taped every episode, my dad and uncle were able to sit down for the world's first binge-watching session.
We should do this more often.
You know, bros watching shows.
This is us at our best.
Like when we'd watch "Lone Ranger" as kids?
You'd always be my Tonto.
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!
I got to hear this.
K.I.T.T.'s lost his nerve.
Who would've thought that a car could doubt itself?
It's not nearly as crazy as when Michael fought his evil goateed twin, Garthe.
Or when K.I.T.T. battled his evil twin K.A.R.R.
with a yellow light instead of the red one!
How do they come up with this stuff?
!
Man, that is one cool ride.
I betcha it looks even better in person.
Whoa, whoa, za-bah-bah-bah-oh-ho-ho hold on!
This is the car that's gonna be in the Thanksgiving Day parade!
I remember hearing that before.
Mur-Man, they park all of the floats in the mall parking lot!
Must be déjà vu.
Come on, you think that The Hoff would bail on an opportunity like this?
Never!
Let's ride.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
What could it be?
Ah, camera.
I can't believe you!
What kind of monster won't let her own son abandon his entire family on Thanksgiving?
!
You left me no choice.
You know I would literally die if I didn't have all my children here for Thanksgiving.
Is that what you want...
To bury your mother on Thanksgiving?
Yes!
Lainey's dad inviting me to his house is the first clear sign that he's given up on hating my guts!
Boopie, now you have the best of both worlds.
You can have dinner with Lainey's family and with your actual family who means so much more than those other people.
Hello.
Welcome to a Goldberg Thanks-
Gangway, gangway!
Have no fear, the Thanksgiving cavalry is here!
Um, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Bill, I told you, you didn't have to bring anything.
Oh, please!
As a guest, it's my job to bring you a few snacks.
Main course.
Also six pies.
That is so sweet.
Really, but no.
We're covered on food, and I'm about to put my turkey in the oven.
Oven?
Well, I guess that's one less delicious way to do it.
Dad, you promised to keep it breezy.
That's me...
Easy-breezy Bill, and he says it can't be Thanksgiving without his famous fried turkey.
Fried?
Never had a Thanksgiving without my fryer.
So, you know...
Do something?
How about we serve both of them?
- Great idea, son.
- You called me son.
Yes, thank you, my actual son.
Double birds.
Makes total sense.
Huge Thanksgiving announcement, Bill and Lainey.
I won't be eating turkey this year for moral reasons.
What's her deal?
Get out of here!
No one has time for your thing this year.
While Thanksgiving was off to a competitive start,
I was realizing I lost out big time.
I seemed to be the only person in all of Philadelphia who wasn't seeing K.I.T.T. that day.
Oh, man.
I wish I was there.
Literally.
- Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
- Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
What the hell is that?
!
It looks your father and your uncle doing the thing you wanted to do...
I know what it is, Pops!
Whoo!
That was amazing.
Who would've enjoyed this more than us?
!
No one, that's who!
There was someone...
A spiteful dork in a puffer vest ready to unleash pure nerd rage.
You!
What are you doing?
!
I got to pull the car in!
How could you two see K.I.T.T. without me?
!
Calm down.
How was I supposed to know you wanted to see the awesome TV car?
'Cause I'm the one who told you about it!
Ahh.
That's where I heard that.
In my defense, you're always talking about these He-Mans, these robots, and these Trons, they all kind of blur together.
You're confusing sci-fi fantasy with reality-based sci-fi action.
You're embarrassing yourself!
Listen, kid, if it's any consolation, you were totally right.
Meeting K.I.T.T. in person...
It was, like, life changing.
It w... it was better than you could ever think!
That's not a consolation!
That's rubbing my face in it!
Look, I know it meant a lot to you, so it's on me.
And...?
And, uh... we should just move past this.
- No!
- Hey!
Hey!
Your father is opening up his heart to you, Adam.
You should be more sensitive to his feelings.
It's Thanksgiving, man!
Kids, huh?
Unbelievable.
Fine!
You want...
You want to see bad?
!
Do...
Mark my words, vengeance will be...
Oh, man, this thing's fast!
Vengeance will be mine!
Ew, there's a spider here!
It was still Thanksgiving, and I was going to dish some sweet revenge by turning my dad and uncle against each other.
Come on, they're getting along.
Don't take that away from them over some singing boat.
Talking car.
Enough with this meshuggaas.
Dad and Uncle Marvin think they can just take my favorite TV show?
We'll see about that when I unleash the power of this.
A fun kid's game?
Ages 8 and up, and guaranteed to turn my uncle against my dad.
That's it, we are officially not brothers!
Guys, relax.
All I said was only one person could be the Michael Knight game piece.
We just have to figure out which one of you is not the hero.
I'm the Hoff!
If anyone is Michael Knight, it's me!
Be the car!
You love the car!
You think that I would ever let you ride in me?
Oh-ho-ho!
I ride in you!
Oh, this is, like, crazy awkward.
We can't have two Michael Knights.
This is just like when we were kids and you always wanted to be the Lone Ranger, and you forced me to be Tonto!
You loved Tonto!
Why don't you both discuss the childhood betrayal in detail?
I always wanted to be the Lone Ranger, but now I proved you wrong!
I'm a cop!
You're not a cop!
You just guard the fountain where the bored dads sit.
Ouch.
Attacking you as a person.
Well, you know everything there is to know about sitting, don't you, Mur?
Because that's all you ever do, you lazy ass!
Well, I'm walking now!
Look at this!
You can't storm out!
That's my move!
He is the worst, huh?
Know what'll really piss him off?
I don't.
Tell me.
Say it!
A picture of you sitting in the real K.I.T.T.
That would prove you're the Hoff.
Hey!
The mall where I work...
That's where they're storing all the Thanksgiving Day floats...
K.I.T.T. included!
Let's go there now.
What a brilliant idea, which you had with no help from me.
Here's your jacket and car keys!
Let's jam!
As my plan was heating up, things were getting frostier between Bill and my mom.
Excusez-moi.
Okay, Bill, if you could just stay in your designated area, I would appreciate it.
Oh, my bad.
You see, when you're a pro at Thanksgiving like me, cooking is like jazz.
You just go where it takes you.
♪ Bad-dap-pap-pow ♪
Salt.
No one likes jazz, okay?
No one.
Oh, well, maybe we should do a little Pepsi challenge.
Put our birds side by side.
Winner takes all!
We're not having a cook-off, okay?
You're a guest in my home.
I couldn't embarrass you like that.
Ooh!
Sounds like someone's scared.
Maybe you should be cooking a chicken instead!
Ba-gawk!
Okay, now he's taunting her with the chicken squawk.
- This is bad.
- Don't sweat it, babe.
Big Tasty is the master at defusing tension.
- There's a line.
- Excuse me.
- Stop it.
- I'm gonna just help you.
Mom.
Bill.
It's Thanksgiving.
And me and Lainey both think...
Oh, sweet god of food, what is in my mouth-face right now?
!
Barry, no!
My famous fried stuffing balls.
Bill wins!
Bill wins the Pepsi challenge for Thanksgiving!
Okay, what Barry meant to say was let's not make today a competition.
It's not what the holiday's about.
Ow, so hot!
Don't care.
Kids make a good point, Bev.
Today's not about winners or losers.
Don't look at me.
You're right.
Shame on us for competing over who cares more about Thanksgiving.
Although, if it was a competition, clearly I'd win because I'm a single dad and this day is all I got.
Oh, would you win, though?
'Cause I'm the one with three kids about to leave the nest and pretty soon it'll just be me and Murray staring silently at each other across a long table thinking,
"Is this all there is?"
Sad story, Bev.
But not as sad as the Thanksgiving when Lainey's mommy left.
Which isn't important, 'cause it's not a competition.
No, it isn't.
So it doesn't matter that I tell you that year
I was too depressed to cook.
Little Lainey looked up at me and said,
"Why no twurkey, Dada?"
In that moment,
I vowed that I would always fry her a turkey.
Okay, now you're both just competing over whose life is sadder.
Oh, you want sad?
I'll give you sad.
It was Thanksgiving 1946, but where was Grandma?
Not at dinner.
She was pinned underneath a trolley car.
Okay, stop.
Just go back to your stupid turkey competition.
- May the best turkey win.
- Which is mine!
Excuse me, I need to get through.
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.
As the turkey competition turned into a nightmare,
I was about to meet the car of my dreams.
Follow me.
Stick to the shadows and watch my 6:00.
♪ Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh ♪
Do you hear that?
Do me a favor.
I want you to take a picture of me as Michael Knight and we can rub it in your dad's ass face!
Say "Trans zam!"
Cool, and then m-maybe we could switch?
Or we can fire it up and then your dad can see me behind the wheel!
Uhh, I think if we get caught driving it, we could get into some serious trouble.
Don't worry, kid.
The security in this mall is terrible.
Aah!
- ♪ Da-dada-da ♪ - ♪ Da-dada-da ♪
- ♪ I am the Knight Rider ♪ - ♪ I am the Knight Rider ♪
What the hell is this?
!
Now who's Michael Knight, you dook nugget?
!
You made my son an accessory to grand theft auto just to get back at me?
It was worth it!
Unless I go to jail.
Then it was not worth it.
Get ready to gobble gobble, Goldbergs!
Yes, we're all very excited to eat a turkey that's been fried in a trash can.
Well, everybody hold on, your taste buds are about to explode!
- Whoa!
- Aah!
Admit it.
I'm the Michael Knight.
I'm even driving the car!
- Son of a bitch!
- Holy crap!
Oh, no, K.I.T.T.'s hurt real bad!
Balls!
Somebody call a car doctor!
That's called a mechanic, you moron.
You shut up!
I'm the Michael Knight, okay?
!
I know exactly what to do here.
What's that?
It had been moments since the Great Goldberg Turkey Explosion, but inside, my family was about to go nuclear.
This is your fault, Mur!
You did that to my car!
It's not your car!
And how would I send a turkey flying out of the sky?
A turkey only goes airborne like that if it's frozen, which means somebody popped it in the freezer!
You did this!
Excuse me?
It's just like you to steal a car on Thanksgiving.
Why don't you bring it back before something worse happens?
!
There you go, bossing me around again!
Face it...
You've been jealous of my turkey since the moment it stepped claw in this house.
This is exactly why I hated playing the Lone Ranger when we were kids.
I had to be bossy!
I was the one raising you, 'cause our dad was never there!
Admit it!
You put that turkey in the freezer!
I never asked you to be my father.
I never asked for you to be my brother, but I didn't get a choice in that either.
All right!
Maybe I did want your turkey to be a tad less delicious than mine, but I didn't know it was going to turn into a meat rocket!
Ah-ha!
Oh, boy.
Barry, say something.
- I have no mother!
- Something helpful.
Then we both agree...
We're done being brothers!
Fine by me!
No!
The idea here was to enjoy a car, not hate each other forever!
Don't look at me!
He's the one that refused to let me be Michael Knight!
I was wrong.
There can be two!
Like how there are two Adam Goldbergs in my school!
Come on, Lainey.
We're leaving!
Yeah!
I'm leaving, as well!
And I'm never coming back!
The Hoff has spoken.
Oh, no, he hasn't.
You know why?
Because I'm the Hoff!
Oh, look, now the Hoff's spoken!
Oh, no, you are mistaken because the Hoff already spoke!
Uncle Marvin, don't go!
You know nothing of the Hoff!
I am the Hoff, infinity, no backsies!
There's two Adam Goldbergs!
One of us uses an F to differentiate!
What the...
Everyone, come back!
It's Thanks-[Bleep]-giving!
This is what you get for being meat eaters.
Not the right time to talk about my thing, huh?
I'll come back later.
Look at that guy...
Born to be a pain in my ass.
Look, don't blame Uncle Marvin.
I may have kind of purposely turned you guys against each other.
Why?
I was mad you saw K.I.T.T. without me, but it was wrong to tear you guys apart.
Also, it was shockingly easy to do.
Honestly, it weirdly took no effort.
Yeah, well, it's on me not remembering that that's your favorite show.
At least I finally got to see the car 'cause, you know, w-we stole it.
And I finally got along with my brother.
For a little while, at least.
Well, it doesn't have to be over.
Let me guess.
You came out here to tell me how much
I screwed everything up again.
I came out here to tell you that, um...
I was wrong.
What?
Look, I know I wasn't great to you when we were growing up... but, you know, Dad wasn't around, and I figured I had to be the boss.
Yeah, well, I'm sure it wasn't easy.
Point is, I should have given you the chance to be the Lone Ranger, too.
Thanks, man, that means a lot.
Well, you can still be the Hoff.
It's up to you.
You know, you're the one who's the cop.
Aww, Mur.
- You're choking me up here.
- That was not my intention.
Bring it in.
No, hugging in a car...
Come on in.
- No, I...
I...
- Okay.
Oh, buddy.
What's going on out there?
Dad apologized to Uncle Marvin.
No.
I guess that's what today's about...
Being thankful for the people that are here, even if they drive you crazy.
In that moment, my mom realized she could still save Thanksgiving.
Well, well, it's the Turkey Saboteur.
I deserve that.
But I, uh... just wanted to tell you that... you win.
- I do?
- Yes.
Your Thanksgivings were way sadder...
And I realize that as much as the holiday means to me... it means way more to you.
Listen, I just wasn't ready to change up Thanksgiving.
It's always been me and Lainey.
She's all I have.
And now you have us, too.
And we can figure out how to have the best Thanksgiving for both of us.
That year, our Thanksgiving got a little bigger.
Okay, folks,
Bev and I aren't quite sure what this will be like, but it's her seasonings and a little bit of Lewis frying know-how.
Dig in!
Holy crap, that's amazing!
What happened to your vegetable thing?
Eh, I'll try it again next year when everyone doesn't have as much stuff going on.
Turns out, doesn't matter what kind of turkey you cook.
And a Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
- Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.
- Or what table you sit at.
It's the people who you welcome into your home and your heart who really matter.
And that's something to be truly thankful for.
Mmm.
_
Go!
Being a vegetarian sucked.
Honestly, I was just looking for something to distract me from thinking about Geoff all the time.
No, freakin' way!
Hey, Geoff!
Look, it's Geoff!
I thought Barry was messing with me when he said K.I.T.T. was here.
"Knight Rider" is my favorite show!
Mine too!
I love the knights and horses and swords.
Maybe don't talk until you've seen it.
We should take her for a spin together!
Uh, maybe grab a burger, just me and you?
Oh, my God, yes!
We can swing by Evy's house and pick her up!
She's gonna flip!
That's not how you wanted it to work, huh?
Yeah, really not my week.
KITT, pick-up girlfriend.
Adult Adam:
Back in the '80s, all the best TV shows featured a cool vehicle.
Airwolf was a badass chopper.
Street Hawk tore it up on a cycle.
But my favorite was K.I.T.T. from "Knight Rider"...
A turbo-boosted talking super car!
I was so obsessed,
I even made my own version of K.I.T.T., and I named it G.I.T.T.!
Oh, no, G.I.T.T.!
The evil corporate types are chasing us in that armored truck!
What the hell did you do to my station wagon?
Isn't it great?
I turned it into G.I.T.T., which stands for Goldberg Industries Turbo Transport!
Well, you're a moron, which stands for moron, moron.
That doesn't work as an acronym.
Even though Hollywood seemed millions of miles away from Jenkintown, as fate would have it,
TV's coolest car was about to roll into my life!
Holy K.I.T.T.
Mom, I am coming to you with an urgent request, 'cause you understand the hopes and dreams of a sensitive, artistic boy.
What is it, Love Bug?
Tell Mama.
I want to go see K.I.T.T. in the Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade.
I'm not driving you anywhere on Thanksgiving.
Please, Mama.
Make the awful man take me to see the thing I love.
Sweetie, I would never deprive my delicious little schmoopster of anything his heart desires.
Yes!
In your face, guy who's gonna drive me to fun!
However, it is Thanksgiving...
It's the one day a year when we gather together as a family and appreciate the feast that I've been working on for months.
In your face.
Fine, forget your car!
I've got my own set of wheels, and I will make it downtown!

It was Thanksgiving, 1980-something, and the Goldbergs' turkey day traditions
- were in full swing...
- [Doorbell rings] which meant a visit from my uncle Marvin.
Freeze, turkeys!
[Laughs]
That's right.
Thanksgiving got a little bit safer.
Now that Officer Goldberg is on the case!
Oh, my God!
I know a cop now.
Okay, don't get sucked in.
He's not a real cop.
He's just an idiot that works in a mall.
Actually, Mur-Man, for the record, I'm more than a cop.
I'm above the law.
The laws don't apply to me.
I'm like The Equalizer or Batman!
Both of which aren't real...
Just like your badge.
Does this look not real to you?
We got a 10-50 at the Goldberg residence, please respond.
Cool!
What's a 10-50?
A homicide.
Murder?

Isn't HQ gonna respond?

No, they can tell by the tone of my voice
I'm just having a little fun.
Awesome!
Do you have a gun?
Nope, I'm not allowed!
But... there's no rules against [Singsong voice] this!
[Laughs] This my little potato gun.
I had it made special.
It may not look like much, but at close range, it'll take out a rhino.
Get that thing out of here before you hurt someone, you moron!
That's it!
As an officer of the Gallery Mall,
I will not be disrespected this way.
I'm storming out!
No.
No.
No.
There will be no storming this year, do you hear me?
We are going to eat together as a family with no drama, understand?
Psht!
[Grunts]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Okay.
Oh!
Here's the story.
Oh!
Barry came at me...
He was out of control.
You're gonna have to stab me in the arm...
That was awesome!
Oh, my God, you're alive!
[Sighs]
[Voice breaking] Come here.
Amazingly, the potato gun wasn't the craziest thing to happen that holiday.
It was a revelation that would change my mom forever.
Mom, I have a huge announcement.
I just read "Diet for a Small Planet,"
and I am officially a vegetarian.
No, you're not.
Get out of here.
Not that stupid thing...
This.
Okay, I'm heading out.
See you at 9:00 when Thanksgiving is over.
What?
Lainey's dad invited me to their big dinner, and I'm going, even though I know what you're gonna say...
[High-pitched voice] "My name is Mom, and this is the most important day of the year for me."
Ha!
That's totally her!
Actually, I wasn't gonna say that at all.
You can go to Lainey's for Thanksgiving if that's what you want.
Really?
You go have fun.
I'll just be here doing my mom thang.
[Chuckles]
Hey, there, guess what.
You're invited to our Thanksgiving.
The invitation is just a formality.
You're coming...
No, it's not an option.
Well, thanks, but we kind of have our own thing...
Okay, it's settled.
Yay!
I'll see you in a few.
Don't bring any food.
I'm closing the door, shutting off all communication, okay?
- Yay again!
- No, I didn't...
While my mom was forcing Bill and Lainey to our Thanksgiving, my dad was forced to spend quality time with his brother.
When we get close enough,
I want you to triangulate the source.
K.I.T.T.:
We should be close enough now.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is this?
It's a show about a talking car that Adam loves.
Pretty silly, isn't it?
Well, yeah, but I-I got to admit,
I'm digging this guy's style.
All right, give me a visual on the license plate.
Good idea.
Whoo-hoo!
You're so right!
The man oozes cool.
Adult Adam:
And then, for the first time in ages, my dad and Uncle Marvin actually had something in common.
- Whoa.

Unexpectedly, Thanksgiving became a thing of joy for them.

We'll just watch one more.

You'd always be my Tonto.
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!

K.I.T.T.'s lost his nerve.
Who would've thought that a car could doubt itself?
It's not nearly as crazy as when Michael fought his evil goateed twin, Garthe.

Whoa, whoa, za-bah-bah-bah-oh-ho-ho hold on!
This is the car that's gonna be in the Thanksgiving Day parade!

Mur-Man, they park all of the floats in the mall parking lot!

That's rubbing my face in it!

And, uh... we should just move past this.
- No!
- Hey!
Hey!
Your father is opening up his heart to you, Adam.
You should be more sensitive to his feelings.
It's Thanksgiving, man!
Kids, huh?
Unbelievable.
Fine!
You want...
You want to see bad?
!
Do...
Mark my words, vengeance will be...
Oh, man, this thing's fast!
[Quickly] Vengeance will be mine!
Ew, there's a spider here!
It was still Thanksgiving, and I was going to dish some sweet revenge by turning my dad and uncle against each other.
Come on, they're getting along.
Don't take that away from them over some singing boat.
Talking car.
Enough with this meshuggaas.
Dad and Uncle Marvin think they can just take my favorite TV show?
[Laughs]
We'll see about that when I unleash the power of this.
A fun kid's game?
Ages 8 and up, and guaranteed to turn my uncle against my dad.
That's it, we are officially not brothers!
Guys, relax.
All I said was only one person could be the Michael Knight game piece.
We just have to figure out which one of you is not the hero.
I'm the Hoff!
If anyone is Michael Knight, it's me!
Be the car!
You love the car!
You think that I would ever let you ride in me?
Oh-ho-ho!
I ride in you!
Oh, this is, like, crazy awkward.
We can't have two Michael Knights.
This is just like when we were kids and you always wanted to be the Lone Ranger, and you forced me to be Tonto!
You loved Tonto!
Why don't you both discuss the childhood betrayal in detail?
I always wanted to be the Lone Ranger, but now I proved you wrong!
I'm a cop!
You're not a cop!
You just guard the fountain where the bored dads sit.
Ouch.
Attacking you as a person.
Well, you know everything there is to know about sitting, don't you, Mur?
Because that's all you ever do, you lazy ass!
Well, I'm walking now!
Look at this!
You can't storm out!
That's my move!
He is the worst, huh?
Know what'll really piss him off?
I don't.
Tell me.
Say it!
A picture of you sitting in the real K.I.T.T.
That would prove you're the Hoff.
Hey!
The mall where I work...
That's where they're storing all the Thanksgiving Day floats...
K.I.T.T. included!
Let's go there now.
What a brilliant idea, which you had with no help from me.
Here's your jacket and car keys!
Let's jam!
As my plan was heating up, things were getting frostier between Bill and my mom.
Excusez-moi.
Okay, Bill, if you could just stay in your designated area, I would appreciate it.
Oh, my bad.
You see, when you're a pro at Thanksgiving like me, cooking is like jazz.
You just go where it takes you.
♪ Bad-dap-pap-pow ♪
Salt.
No one likes jazz, okay?
No one.
Oh, well, maybe we should do a little Pepsi challenge.
Put our birds side by side.
Winner takes all!
We're not having a cook-off, okay?
You're a guest in my home.
I couldn't embarrass you like that.
Ooh!
Sounds like someone's scared.
Maybe you should be cooking a chicken instead!
Ba-gawk!
Okay, now he's taunting her with the chicken squawk.
- This is bad.
- Don't sweat it, babe.
Big Tasty is the master at defusing tension.
- There's a line.
- Excuse me.
- Stop it.
- I'm gonna just help you.
Mom.
Bill.
It's Thanksgiving.
And me and Lainey both think...
Oh, sweet god of food, what is in my mouth-face right now?
!
Barry, no!
My famous fried stuffing balls.
Bill wins!
Bill wins the Pepsi challenge for Thanksgiving!
Okay, what Barry meant to say was let's not make today a competition.
It's not what the holiday's about.
Ow, so hot!
Don't care.
Kids make a good point, Bev.
Today's not about winners or losers.
Don't look at me.
You're right.
Shame on us for competing over who cares more about Thanksgiving.
Although, if it was a competition, clearly I'd win because I'm a single dad and this day is all I got.
Oh, would you win, though?
'Cause I'm the one with three kids about to leave the nest and pretty soon it'll just be me and Murray staring silently at each other across a long table thinking,
"Is this all there is?"
Sad story, Bev.
But not as sad as the Thanksgiving when Lainey's mommy left.
Which isn't important, 'cause it's not a competition.
No, it isn't.
So it doesn't matter that I tell you that year
I was too depressed to cook.
Little Lainey looked up at me and said,
[High-pitched] "Why no twurkey, Dada?"
[Normal voice] In that moment,
I vowed that I would always fry her a turkey.
Okay, now you're both just competing over whose life is sadder.
Oh, you want sad?
I'll give you sad.
It was Thanksgiving 1946, but where was Grandma?
Not at dinner.
She was pinned underneath a trolley car.
Okay, stop.
Just go back to your stupid turkey competition.
- May the best turkey win.
- Which is mine!
Excuse me, I need to get through.
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.
As the turkey competition turned into a nightmare,
I was about to meet the car of my dreams.
Follow me.
Stick to the shadows and watch my 6:00.

[Normal voice] You shut up!
I'm the Michael Knight, okay?

I know exactly what to do here.
What's that?
It had been moments since the Great Goldberg Turkey Explosion, but inside, my family was about to go nuclear.
This is your fault, Mur!
You did that to my car!
It's not your car!
And how would I send a turkey flying out of the sky?
A turkey only goes airborne like that if it's frozen, which means somebody popped it in the freezer!
You did this!
Excuse me?
It's just like you to steal a car on Thanksgiving.
Why don't you bring it back before something worse happens?
!
There you go, bossing me around again!
Face it...
You've been jealous of my turkey since the moment it stepped claw in this house.
This is exactly why I hated playing the Lone Ranger when we were kids.
I had to be bossy!
I was the one raising you, 'cause our dad was never there!
Admit it!
You put that turkey in the freezer!
I never asked you to be my father.
I never asked for you to be my brother, but I didn't get a choice in that either.
All right!
Maybe I did want your turkey to be a tad less delicious than mine, but I didn't know it was going to turn into a meat rocket!
Ah-ha!
Oh, boy.
Barry, say something.
- I have no mother!
- Something helpful.
Then we both agree...
We're done being brothers!
Fine by me!
No!

Oh, no, he hasn't.

Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?
Because instead of being in the telescope room,
I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.
Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
Hey.
Hello.
Hey, bud.
Ready to play when you are.
Yeah, um, in a minute.
I actually need to tell you guys something.
If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
What's going on?
I'm, uh... uh, gonna be a father.
That's so amazing.
What?
Congratulations.
Oh, no.
Why "oh, no"?
Because this changes everything.
What about comic book night?
Uh, what about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?
How can we do those things with a child around?
Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
Oh, dear L...
Penny's pregnant, too?
You're the other baby.
Oh, really?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
I guess we'll call this a draw.
So, I'm glad you guys are here.
There's something I want to share with you.
Howie and I are going to...
Leonard says you're pregnant.
What?
"Don't say anything.
Act surprised when she tells you."
All right, how you want to do this?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
This is so exciting!
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
Are-are you not happy about this?
I am.
Of-of course I am.
I'm...
I'm sure it's just the hormones.
But it's weird-
- Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea
and I'm gonna get fat.
No, no, come on.
Come on, you're not gonna get fat.
You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.
Sorry, hormones.
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
You're probably right.
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.
Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.
And then there's this nose.
I mean, what if he looks like me?
Or worse... what if she looks like me?
Not to mention the impact on our social circle.
Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
A million dollars?
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.
That's it-
- I got to start earning more money right now.
I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
This isn't a joke.
I wasn't joking.
It'll be fine.
People have kids every day.
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
Oh...
You're right, it is,
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.
Hey, you know what we should do?
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
Go out and celebrate.
But not your worst idea.
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?
Uh, I don't know, a bar?
Can't drink.
We can, but all right.
Are you hungry?
How about that sushi place you love?
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.
We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
Maybe you should get a new doctor.
What, he said you can't laugh either?
I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard-- his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...
And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
Cheers.
Well, look at this.
I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money.
He can have all the kids he wants.
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.
You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
That's just research.
We're never gonna make any money from it.
Forget helium.
The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.
Reminds me of my daddy's secret
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
Oh.
I'll just take one last sip.
Ah.
Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.
How is that a new invention?
I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
It's true.
I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
This place is terrific.
Why-why have we never been here before?
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.
That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.
Where's the bathroom?
Uh, it's in the corner.
Excuse me.
Hey, how you doin'?
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
Doesn't matter.
He's headed for the kitchen anyway.
Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.
They have that.
It's called Uber.
Hey.
In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
Wow.
I've never thought about that.
And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
You may have actually just come up with something.
You think so?
I really do.
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.
There's people cooking in it.
Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Yeah!
Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.
It only lets out three at a time.
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
Well, we didn't exactly decide.
We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.
Me!
Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!
Fine.
We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
Oh, that sounds juicy.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.
You did it at our place?
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
What?
!
No!
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"
but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."
How could you do that?
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
I do know what that's like.
I really do.
I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
I'm not finding anything either.
That's a good sign.
Oh, wait, I found something.
Damn.
What is it?
This video.
The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
Can you focus on what we're talking about?
All right.
Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
And stronger.
Yeah.
Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
I'd enjoy that.
Nah, she's a good kid.
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
Look at that.
You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.
I'm telling you, you got this.
Maybe you're right.
Of course he's right.
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
You guys can go in if you want.
No, we're a team.
If you can't go in, we're not going in.
Then why are we drinking?
Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?
Oh.
It's Leonard.
He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
That sounds fun.
Oh, no.
Sheldon's drunk texting me.
What's it say?
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
How is that a drunk text?
He used a period instead of a question mark.
He's so wasted.

Hi.
How are you doing?
Oh, wonderful.
I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move.
If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
I'm really glad you're here.
Can we talk?
Sure.
So, you gonna get up there later?
A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it?
You bet I am.
I'm sorry I freaked out this morning.
I want you to know...
I'm done being scared.
It's okay to be nervous.
I am, too.
Thank God, 'cause I was lying-- you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants.
But I'm also really excited.
I mean it.
Me, too.
I love you.
Mmm.
And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.

Good night!
That was such a fun night.
Probably 'cause you got to see your man up there rockin' the mic.
Yeah, yeah.
I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
Oh.
That was really an asthma attack.
I just sold it.
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
Me, too.
So, you ever think about it?
Babies?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.
What about you?
I think we'd make amazing parents.
Will you guys keep it down?
On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.

Previously on The Big Bang Theory...
Oh, look at all that chest hair.
And overbite.
Of course you're a Wolowitz.
Son of a bitch, he bit me.
Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
Morning.
Morning.
"We"?
What is this?
I don't know.
Maybe it says something on the back.
"Continued on milk."
If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.
"Are."
"We are..."
"See spoons for more."
What could it be?
"We are Groot"?
"We are the champions"?
"We are family"?
"I got all my sisters with me."
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Pretty positive.
That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents?
We're gonna get to board planes first.
Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.
I know, it's crazy.
It is crazy.
Oh.
I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?
I mean, can we afford a nanny?
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.
I-I don't know, Howie.
Are we in a good school district?
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.
What religion do we raise it?
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
How's it gonna be okay?
Look at me, I'm a mess.
And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.
And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.

Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?
Because instead of being in the telescope room,
I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.
Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
Hey.
Hello.
Hey, bud.
Ready to play when you are.
Yeah, um, in a minute.
I actually need to tell you guys something.
If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
What's going on?
I'm, uh... uh, gonna be a father.
That's so amazing.
What?
Congratulations.
Oh, no.
Why "oh, no"?
Because this changes everything.
What about comic book night?
Uh, what about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?
How can we do those things with a child around?
Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
Oh, dear L...
Penny's pregnant, too?
You're the other baby.
Oh, really?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
I guess we'll call this a draw.
So, I'm glad you guys are here.
There's something I want to share with you.
Howie and I are going to...
Leonard says you're pregnant.
What?
"Don't say anything.
Act surprised when she tells you."
All right, how you want to do this?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
This is so exciting!
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
Are-are you not happy about this?
I am.
Of-of course I am.
I'm...
I'm sure it's just the hormones.
But it's weird-
- Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea
and I'm gonna get fat.
No, no, come on.
Come on, you're not gonna get fat.
You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.
Sorry, hormones.
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
You're probably right.
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.
Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.
And then there's this nose.
I mean, what if he looks like me?
Or worse... what if she looks like me?
Not to mention the impact on our social circle.
Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
A million dollars?
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.
That's it-
- I got to start earning more money right now.
I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
This isn't a joke.
I wasn't joking.
It'll be fine.
People have kids every day.
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
Oh...
You're right, it is,
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.
Hey, you know what we should do?
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
Go out and celebrate.
But not your worst idea.
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?
Uh, I don't know, a bar?
Can't drink.
We can, but all right.
Are you hungry?
How about that sushi place you love?
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.
We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
Maybe you should get a new doctor.
What, he said you can't laugh either?
I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard-- his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...
And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
Cheers.
Well, look at this.
I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money.
He can have all the kids he wants.
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.
You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
That's just research.
We're never gonna make any money from it.
Forget helium.
The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.
Reminds me of my daddy's secret
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
Oh.
I'll just take one last sip.
Ah.
Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.
How is that a new invention?
I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
It's true.
I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
This place is terrific.
Why-why have we never been here before?
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.
That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.
Where's the bathroom?
Uh, it's in the corner.
Excuse me.
Hey, how you doin'?
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
Doesn't matter.
He's headed for the kitchen anyway.
Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.
They have that.
It's called Uber.
Hey.
In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
Wow.
I've never thought about that.
And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
You may have actually just come up with something.
You think so?
I really do.
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.
There's people cooking in it.
Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Yeah!
Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.
It only lets out three at a time.
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
Well, we didn't exactly decide.
We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.
Me!
Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!
Fine.
We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
Oh, that sounds juicy.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.
You did it at our place?
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
What?
!
No!
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"
but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."
How could you do that?
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
I do know what that's like.
I really do.
I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
I'm not finding anything either.
That's a good sign.
Oh, wait, I found something.
Damn.
What is it?
This video.
The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
Can you focus on what we're talking about?
All right.
Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
And stronger.
Yeah.
Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
I'd enjoy that.
Nah, she's a good kid.
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
Look at that.
You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.
I'm telling you, you got this.
Maybe you're right.
Of course he's right.
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
You guys can go in if you want.
No, we're a team.
If you can't go in, we're not going in.
Then why are we drinking?
Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?
Oh.
It's Leonard.
He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
That sounds fun.
Oh, no.
Sheldon's drunk texting me.
What's it say?
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
How is that a drunk text?

He's so wasted.

If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.
You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
That's just research.
We're never gonna make any money from it.
Forget helium.
The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.
Reminds me of my daddy's secret
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
Oh.
I'll just take one last sip.
(slurping)
Ah.
Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.
How is that a new invention?
I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
It's true.
I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
This place is terrific.
Why-why have we never been here before?
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.
That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.
Where's the bathroom?
Uh, it's in the corner.
Excuse me.
Hey, how you doin'?
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
LEONARD:
Doesn't matter.
He's headed for the kitchen anyway.
Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.
They have that.
It's called Uber.
WOLOWITZ:
Hey.
In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
Wow.
I've never thought about that.
And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
You may have actually just come up with something.
You think so?
I really do.
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.
There's people cooking in it.
Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Yeah!
Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.
It only lets out three at a time.
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
Well, we didn't exactly decide.
We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.
Me!
Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!
Fine.
We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
Oh, that sounds juicy.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.
You did it at our place?
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
What?
!
No!
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"
but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."
How could you do that?
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
I do know what that's like.
I really do.
I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
I'm not finding anything either.
That's a good sign.
Oh, wait, I found something.
Damn.
What is it?
This video.
The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
Can you focus on what we're talking about?
All right.
Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
And stronger.
Yeah.
Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
I'd enjoy that.
Nah, she's a good kid.
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
Look at that.
You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.
LEONARD:
I'm telling you, you got this.
Maybe you're right.
Of course he's right.
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
You guys can go in if you want.
No, we're a team.
If you can't go in, we're not going in.
Then why are we drinking?
Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?
(phone chimes)
Oh.
It's Leonard.
He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
That sounds fun.
(phone chimes)
(chuckles) Oh, no.
Sheldon's drunk texting me.
What's it say?
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
How is that a drunk text?
He used a period instead of a question mark.
He's so wasted.

I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move.

I'm really glad you're here.
Can we talk?
Sure.
So, you gonna get up there later?
A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it?
You bet I am.
I'm sorry I freaked out this morning.
I want you to know...
I'm done being scared.
It's okay to be nervous.
I am, too.
Thank God, 'cause I was lying-- you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants.

Mmm.
And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.

Yeah, yeah.
I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
Oh.
That was really an asthma attack.
I just sold it.
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
Me, too.
So, you ever think about it?
Babies?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.

Of course you're a Wolowitz.

Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
Morning.
Morning.
"We"?
What is this?
I don't know.
Maybe it says something on the back.
"Continued on milk."
If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.

Yeah.
Are you sure?
Pretty positive.
That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents?
We're gonna get to board planes first.
Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.
I know, it's crazy.
It is crazy.
Oh.
I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?
I mean, can we afford a nanny?
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.
I-I don't know, Howie.
Are we in a good school district?
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.
What religion do we raise it?
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
How's it gonna be okay?
Look at me, I'm a mess.

Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?
Because instead of being in the telescope room,
I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.
Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
Hey.
Hello.
Hey, bud.
Ready to play when you are.
Yeah, um, in a minute.
I actually need to tell you guys something.
If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
What's going on?
I'm, uh... uh, gonna be a father.
That's so amazing.
What?
Congratulations.
Oh, no.
Why "oh, no"?
Because this changes everything.
What about comic book night?
Uh, what about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?
How can we do those things with a child around?
Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
Oh, dear L...
Penny's pregnant, too?
You're the other baby.
Oh, really?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
I guess we'll call this a draw.
So, I'm glad you guys are here.
There's something I want to share with you.
Howie and I are going to...
Leonard says you're pregnant.
What?
"Don't say anything.
Act surprised when she tells you."
All right, how you want to do this?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
This is so exciting!
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
Are-are you not happy about this?
I am.
Of-of course I am.
I'm...
I'm sure it's just the hormones.
But it's weird-
- Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea
and I'm gonna get fat.
No, no, come on.
Come on, you're not gonna get fat.
You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.
Sorry, hormones.
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
You're probably right.
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.
Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.
And then there's this nose.
I mean, what if he looks like me?
Or worse... what if she looks like me?
Not to mention the impact on our social circle.
Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
A million dollars?
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.
That's it-
- I got to start earning more money right now.
I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
This isn't a joke.
I wasn't joking.
It'll be fine.
People have kids every day.
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
Oh...
You're right, it is,
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.
Hey, you know what we should do?
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
Go out and celebrate.
But not your worst idea.
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?
Uh, I don't know, a bar?
Can't drink.
We can, but all right.
Are you hungry?
How about that sushi place you love?
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.
We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
Maybe you should get a new doctor.
What, he said you can't laugh either?
I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard-- his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...
And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
Cheers.
Well, look at this.
I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money.
He can have all the kids he wants.
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
There's no reason you can't.

Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
Hey.
Hello.
Hey, bud.
Ready to play when you are.
Yeah, um, in a minute.
I actually need to tell you guys something.
If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
What's going on?
I'm, uh... uh, gonna be a father.
That's so amazing.
What?
Congratulations.
Oh, no.
Why "oh, no"?
Because this changes everything.
What about comic book night?
Uh, what about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?
How can we do those things with a child around?
Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
Oh, dear L...
Penny's pregnant, too?
You're the other baby.
Oh, really?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
I guess we'll call this a draw.
So, I'm glad you guys are here.
There's something I want to share with you.
Howie and I are going to...
Leonard says you're pregnant.
What?
"Don't say anything.
Act surprised when she tells you."
All right, how you want to do this?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
This is so exciting!
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
Are-are you not happy about this?
I am.
Of-of course I am.
I'm...
I'm sure it's just the hormones.
But it's weird-
- Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea
and I'm gonna get fat.
No, no, come on.
Come on, you're not gonna get fat.
You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.
Sorry, hormones.
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
You're probably right.
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.
Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.
And then there's this nose.
I mean, what if he looks like me?
Or worse... what if she looks like me?
Not to mention the impact on our social circle.
Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
A million dollars?
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.
That's it-
- I got to start earning more money right now.
I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
This isn't a joke.
I wasn't joking.
It'll be fine.
People have kids every day.
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
Oh...
You're right, it is,
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.
Hey, you know what we should do?
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
Go out and celebrate.
But not your worst idea.
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?
Uh, I don't know, a bar?
Can't drink.
We can, but all right.
Are you hungry?
How about that sushi place you love?
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.
We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
Maybe you should get a new doctor.
What, he said you can't laugh either?
I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard-- his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...
And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
Cheers.
Well, look at this.
I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money.
He can have all the kids he wants.
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.
You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
That's just research.
We're never gonna make any money from it.
Forget helium.
The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.
Reminds me of my daddy's secret
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
Oh.
I'll just take one last sip.
Ah.
Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.
How is that a new invention?
I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
It's true.
I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
This place is terrific.
Why-why have we never been here before?
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.
That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.
Where's the bathroom?
Uh, it's in the corner.
Excuse me.
Hey, how you doin'?
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
Doesn't matter.
He's headed for the kitchen anyway.
Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.
They have that.
It's called Uber.
Hey.
In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
Wow.
I've never thought about that.
And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
You may have actually just come up with something.
You think so?
I really do.
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.
There's people cooking in it.
Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Yeah!
Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.
It only lets out three at a time.
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
Well, we didn't exactly decide.
We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.
Me!
Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!
Fine.
We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
Oh, that sounds juicy.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.
You did it at our place?
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
What?
!
No!
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"
but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."
How could you do that?
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
I do know what that's like.
I really do.
I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
I'm not finding anything either.
That's a good sign.
Oh, wait, I found something.
Damn.
What is it?
This video.
The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
Can you focus on what we're talking about?
All right.
Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
And stronger.
Yeah.
Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
I'd enjoy that.
Nah, she's a good kid.
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
Look at that.
You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.
I'm telling you, you got this.
Maybe you're right.
Of course he's right.
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
You guys can go in if you want.
No, we're a team.
If you can't go in, we're not going in.
Then why are we drinking?
Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?
Oh.
It's Leonard.
He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
That sounds fun.
Oh, no.
Sheldon's drunk texting me.
What's it say?
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
How is that a drunk text?
He used a period instead of a question mark.
He's so wasted.

How are you doing?
Oh, wonderful.
I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move.
If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
I'm really glad you're here.
Can we talk?
Sure.
So, you gonna get up there later?
A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it?
You bet I am.
I'm sorry I freaked out this morning.
I want you to know...
I'm done being scared.
It's okay to be nervous.
I am, too.
Thank God, 'cause I was lying-- you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants.
But I'm also really excited.
I mean it.
Me, too.
I love you.
Mmm.
And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.

Yeah, yeah.
I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
Oh.
That was really an asthma attack.
I just sold it.
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
Me, too.
So, you ever think about it?
Babies?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.
What about you?
I think we'd make amazing parents.
Will you guys keep it down?
On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.

Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
Morning.
Morning.
"We"?
What is this?
I don't know.
Maybe it says something on the back.
"Continued on milk."
If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.
"Are."
"We are..."
"See spoons for more."
(chuckles)
What could it be?
"We are Groot"?
"We are the champions"?
"We are family"?
"I got all my sisters with me."
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Pretty positive.
That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents?
We're gonna get to board planes first.
Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.
I know, it's crazy.
It is crazy.
Oh.
I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?
I mean, can we afford a nanny?
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.
I-I don't know, Howie.
Are we in a good school district?
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.
What religion do we raise it?
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
How's it gonna be okay?
Look at me, I'm a mess.
And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.
And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.

Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?

Thank you, Pasadena!
Good night!
That was such a fun night.
Probably 'cause you got to see your man up there rockin' the mic.
Yeah, yeah.
I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
Oh.
That was really an asthma attack.
I just sold it.
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
Me, too.
So, you ever think about it?
Babies?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.
What about you?
I think we'd make amazing parents.
SHELDON:
Will you guys keep it down?
On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...
Oh, look at all that chest hair.
And overbite.
Of course you're a Wolowitz.
Son of a bitch, he bit me.
Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
Morning.
Morning.
"We"?
What is this?
I don't know.
Maybe it says something on the back.
"Continued on milk."
If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.
"Are."
"We are..."
"See spoons for more."
(chuckles)
What could it be?
"We are Groot"?
"We are the champions"?
"We are family"?
"I got all my sisters with me."
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Pretty positive.
That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents?
We're gonna get to board planes first.
Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.
I know, it's crazy.
It is crazy.
Oh.
I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?
I mean, can we afford a nanny?
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.
I-I don't know, Howie.
Are we in a good school district?
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.
What religion do we raise it?
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
How's it gonna be okay?
Look at me, I'm a mess.
And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.
And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.

Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?
Because instead of being in the telescope room,
I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.
Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
Hey.
SHELDON:
Hello.
Hey, bud.
Ready to play when you are.
Yeah, um, in a minute.
I actually need to tell you guys something.
If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
What's going on?
(clears throat)
I'm, uh...
(chuckles) uh, gonna be a father.
That's so amazing.
What?
Congratulations.
Oh, no.
Why "oh, no"?
Because this changes everything.
What about comic book night?
Uh, what about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?
How can we do those things with a child around?
Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
Oh, dear L...
Penny's pregnant, too?
You're the other baby.
Oh, really?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
I guess we'll call this a draw.
So, I'm glad you guys are here.
There's something I want to share with you. (phone dings)
Howie and I are going to... (gasps) Leonard says you're pregnant.
What?
"Don't say anything.
Act surprised when she tells you."
All right, how you want to do this?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
This is so exciting!
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
Are-are you not happy about this?
I am.
Of-of course I am.
I'm...
I'm sure it's just the hormones.
But it's weird-
- Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea
and I'm gonna get fat.
No, no, come on.
Come on, you're not gonna get fat.
You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.
Sorry, hormones.
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
You're probably right.
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.
Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.
And then there's this nose.
I mean, what if he looks like me?
Or worse... (gasps) what if she looks like me?
Not to mention the impact on our social circle.
Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
A million dollars?
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.
That's it-
- I got to start earning more money right now.
I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
This isn't a joke.
I wasn't joking.
It'll be fine.
People have kids every day.
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
Oh...
You're right, it is,
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.
Hey, you know what we should do?
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
Go out and celebrate.
But not your worst idea.
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?
Uh, I don't know, a bar?
Can't drink.
We can, but all right.
Are you hungry?
How about that sushi place you love?
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.
We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
Maybe you should get a new doctor.
What, he said you can't laugh either?
I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard-- his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...
And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
ALL:
Cheers.
Well, look at this.
I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money.
He can have all the kids he wants.
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.
You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
That's just research.
We're never gonna make any money from it.
Forget helium.
The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.
Reminds me of my daddy's secret
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
Oh.
I'll just take one last sip.
(slurping)
Ah.
Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.
How is that a new invention?
I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
It's true.
I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
This place is terrific.
Why-why have we never been here before?
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.
That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.
Where's the bathroom?
Uh, it's in the corner.
Excuse me.
Hey, how you doin'?
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
LEONARD:
Doesn't matter.
He's headed for the kitchen anyway.
Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.
They have that.
It's called Uber.
WOLOWITZ:
Hey.
In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
Wow.
I've never thought about that.
And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
You may have actually just come up with something.
You think so?
I really do.
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.
There's people cooking in it.
Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Yeah!
Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.
It only lets out three at a time.
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
Well, we didn't exactly decide.
We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.
Me!
Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!
Fine.
We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
Oh, that sounds juicy.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.
You did it at our place?
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
What?
!
No!
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"
but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."
How could you do that?
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
I do know what that's like.
I really do.
I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
I'm not finding anything either.
That's a good sign.
Oh, wait, I found something.
Damn.
What is it?
This video.
The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
Can you focus on what we're talking about?
All right.
Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
And stronger.
Yeah.
Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
I'd enjoy that.
Nah, she's a good kid.
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
Look at that.
You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.
LEONARD:
I'm telling you, you got this.
Maybe you're right.
Of course he's right.
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
You guys can go in if you want.
No, we're a team.
If you can't go in, we're not going in.
Then why are we drinking?
Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?
(phone chimes)
Oh.
It's Leonard.
He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
That sounds fun.
(phone chimes)
(chuckles) Oh, no.
Sheldon's drunk texting me.
What's it say?
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
How is that a drunk text?
He used a period instead of a question mark.
He's so wasted.

Bah!
Woof!
Oh.
Huh?
Huh?
Aaaaaaah!
Aaah!
Steven.
Didn't you feel that?
Feel what?
The ground shook!
This could be the start of the emergence of the cluster.
Stage 1:
Slight tremors every quarter hour.
Stage 2:
Full-scale earthquakes.
Stage 3:
The earth is destroyed!
We're running out of time.
We need to drill right now!
No, it's Malachite!
Malachite?
What?
I was on mask island.
I was in a watermelon Steven.
They have a lovely community, but Malachite, she was there.
Lapis lazuli is losing control.
Soon, Jasper will overpower her and Malachite will be loose.
Who knows what sort of destruction an unstable fusion like Malachite could cause?
All right, gems, Pearl, Amethyst, and I will walk to mask island.
Steven, it's too dangerous for you.
Stay here and watch after the drill with Peridot.
Let's go, gems.
To the nearest warp pad.
To the nearest warp pad!
Whoa.
So, lazuli has Jasper trapped in a fusion?
You're joking me.
It's true!
But Lapis must be getting tired from fighting Jasper for so long.
Just being on a ship with Jasper made me tired.
Whoa.
Oh!
Aah!
I gotta help them!
But they told me it was too dangerous.
Why don't you just disobey them?
Rebel.
Isn't that like your guys' thing?
Huh, you're right!
Ooh, I know!
I'll fall asleep and go into a watermelon Steven again.
This way, I can help them and be safe, at the same time.
Wow.
You're a real anarchist.
No one can tell me what to do.
Wait!
What do I do now?
Don't just leave me here!
All right, let's put an end to this.
Give up!
I'm impressed.
You really held out.
Malachi-i-te!
They're here.
Stop!
Pathetic.
Don't you see?
We've been holding us back for too long.
And for what?
If we're going to be this thing together, why don't we have some fun?
We don't have to fight.
You're outnumbered.
I may be outnumbered, but you're out of your depth.
I can't wait to tear you gems apart.
Rawr!
Rawr rawr rawr!
Rawr rawr rawr!
Arr rawr rawr arr rawr rawr rawr.
Rawr rawr rawr, rawr.
Rawr rawr rawr.
Rawr rawr rawr, rawr rawr rawr rawr!

There really is something more to this fusion thing.
It's not just a cheap thrill.
Aaaah!
You've really shown me a whole new world of possibilities.
Keep it together.
Allow me to thank you.
Oh!
Sorry, but there's only room for one abomination on this measly planet.
Huh?
Aaaaaaaaah!
Oh!
Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa- aa-aa-aa-ah!
Huh?
Unh!
Unh!
Argh!
What is this?
!
You think you can hold me down?
!
Nobody can.
Aah!
Ah!
Not anymore.
Hey!
Don't forget about me.
Agh!
Ooh!
Arr-arr!
You two should spend some time apart.
Agh!
Urr.
I'm alive.
Steven?
Is that you in there?
Thank you.
We couldn't have done it without your help.
Good job, melonhead.
Thank you, all of you.
You are truly brave.
Aw.
Uh-oh!
It must be the cluster.
Peridot was right.
Steven, it's up to you.
The world was destroyed.
We don't make it back in time.
Wake up.
Get Peridot and start drilling.
The earth needs you, Steven.
We'll be fine.
You can do this.
We believe in you.
You got this, dude!
You know the drill.
Be careful, Steven.
Watch each other's backs.
And, Steven, we love you.
And, Steven, we love you.
If you're done just lying there, maybe it's about time that we stop the world from ending!
Where are the others?
!
They're stuck on mask island!
We have to drill without them!
Ugh!
Am I the only one who understands the meaning of teamwork?
!
Okay, Steven, are you ready to drill down into the planet, to depths never before reached by your species to stop the cluster before it forms and save your world?
!
I don't know.
Don't say that.
Say we'll do it together and it's gonna be great!
We're gonna do it together, and it's gonna be great!
Liar!
Ahh!
Wah!
Unh!
Ready or not, we have a mission.
Increasing speed.
All right.
Bracing for impact.
It's actually two more hours to the cluster.
Oh.
Wish I'd brought some tunes.
Uh, thanks.
It's kind of freaky down here, huh?
Why is that?
It's just dark and cramped.
I can't even...
Stretch out.
How did you think you were gonna get everyone in here, anyway?
I don't know.
They'd shrink or something.
We didn't have a lot of time to plan.
So, what is the plan?
We have a drill.
We're going to drill.
Get ready.
We're about to penetrate the asthenosphere.
Whoa!
It's all lava.
Lava is what comes out of volcanoes.
That's superheated Peridotite.
Peridot-ite?
Yeah.
It's made of the same stuff as Peridots.
You were made on homeworld, right?
Mm-hmm.
What was it like?
I didn't exist, then I did.
I don't have memories of it, just feelings.
I know I can never go back to homeworld, but it's hard not to have some feelings for where you came from.
But it's fine.
I have something different now.
W-what's that?
You know...
You guys.
What's that sound?
A gem mutant!
They must have buried some prototypes with the cluster.
They're all over us!
They're attacking the drill!
What do we do?
!
Pearl didn't think it was necessary, but I never leave home without a blast cannon.
Something doesn't feel right about this.
Then use the d-pad.
No, it's just...
These things, we can't just leave their gems out there.
They're going to form again later.
If I could just bubble them, then they'd be safe.
Come on.
We've got to help them.
There is no helping them.
They're too broken.
The beings who used to be in those shards are so shattered they don't know who they are or what's happening around them.
They just seek out other gems, looking for the missing pieces of themselves, trying to make themselves whole.
These early experiments only combine two or three shards.
The cluster will be a billion times bigger... an inseparable fusion capable of destroying worlds, starting with this one.
We're hitting some denser rock.
This is it!
Recovery depth achieved.
Target found.
Is that...
The cluster.
What's happening?
!
It's too late!
It's taking form!
Steven, I'm sorry I couldn't save you or the billions of other life-forms who matter far, far less to me.
Do you have any last words?
!
I love you, Peridot.
Wow.
Thanks.
It's still struggling to take its form!
This means we still might have time!
There's still a chance!
Just a little repositioning!
Peridot, I don't think we should hurt the cluster.
I don't think it knows what it's doing.
It doesn't matter if it knows what it's doing, it's still going to do it.
What?
!
Is the increased vibration causing damage to your head holes?
I don't know!
We're not even piercing the crust yet!
I need to increase power!
Are you going to be okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I think its just the noise...
I think.
Keep going.
Affirmative.
Activating triple-tip penetration mode!
Runaway drill!
There!
Just got to keep balance!
Okay.
Aah!
Aaah!
I don't know if it's going to hold!
I don't...
Understand what's happening!
What's wrong?
!
I don't know!
Steven!
Steven?
!
Peridot?
Peridot?
!
Want to.
Need to.
You...
Want to?
Want to what?
Form!
Aaah!
Please, stop!
It's the cluster.
I'm talking to the cluster?
But how did I get inside your brain?
Brains?
Must, have to, want to, need to.
Must, have to...
Wait!
Please, don't take form!
Want to, need to... form!
Form, form, form!
Want form!
Want form!
Form!
Maybe instead of forming, you could do something else?
Form!
Boy, you've sure got the one-trackiest mind I ever met!
Need form!
Aah!
To be whole.
Whole?
Oh, you're shards.
You just want to find the rest of your gems.
But forming won't help you find the rest of yourselves.
You'll just destroy the earth.
No, no, no, no, no.
But if you want to find other gems, there's so many of you right here.
Look... shard, meet shard.
Have to.
Want to.
See, you already have so much to talk about.
Hello.
Hi.
This is great!
You don't even need to form!
You can just stay here!
Want to stay.
But...
Can't stop!
Going to form!
Can't stop!
Going to form!
Help!
Help!
It's okay.
If I just bubble you, you won't have to come out.
It'll keep you safe.
Here, look...
like this!
I can bubble you!
I can bubble you!
I can bubble you!
Well, that's five out of...
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry!
I can't do it alone!
Whoa!
Steven, wake up!
It doesn't want to form!
What?
!
We got to put it in a bubble!
Bubble that?
!
There's no way!
They're bubbling each other!
I've got you!
You've got this!
We've all got each other!
Whoa!
You did it!
We did it together, and it was great!
Huh?
Guys, you're back!
Is Lapis okay?
She'll be fine.
You look happy!
Did you destroy the cluster?
- No, I talked to it!
- What?
It doesn't want to destroy the earth.
It just wants company, and it's got it now.
It's like a bajillion people!
They'll have lots of time to get to know each other...
Now that they're in a bubble.
How on earth did you bubble that whole thing?
We had a little help.
__
Six years ago, the Leyland School was blessed with the arrival of Dan Sullivan.
Four winning seasons, a state championship...
Ms. Blaine, we're suspending Taylor from school.
There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code.
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.
He was really messed up.
We need to talk with Becca.
I do not want her at those parties.
Bitch looking good, huh?
D-damn.
Terri: $20,000 a year on that school.
You'd think he'd make better choices.
You know that girl is just...
Oh, I know you're not getting down on the sister.
Anne:
What were you doing?
!
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!
I had a couple of beers.
Then everything got messed up.
I think someone did something to me.
A student is claiming to have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know that's a lie.
Don't think your kids are above mistakes.
You need to talk to your players.
- What are you doing about what happened to him?
- We've taken disciplinary action
- appropriate to the circumstance...
- What are you doing to those boys?
!
- Tell me what you're doing to the boys!
- The suspension is fair.
As bad as it may seem, it can get worse.
Man: 911.
What's your emergency?
I want to report a rape.
Roberts:
Ms. Blaine?
Yes.
Did you call 911?
When did the assault take place?
Last Saturday.
You know the location?
Uh, it was a party.
I'm not sure where.
Exact location's gonna be important to detectives, okay?
Victim's name?
Taylor.
Where's she now?
Taylor's my son.
The victim's a male?
Yes, my son.
And this is a sexual assault?
Yes.
Does your son know the assailant?
It was some other kids at the school.
One kid?
More than one?
He doesn't remember.
He doesn't remember?
Or he's not saying?
he was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son to the hospital, get a rape kit done.
Sanders:
Is your son here?
Yes.
Maybe he should come out and talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, we need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Look, if he's not going to help us, we can't help him.
[Sighs]
[Indistinct shouting, scattered applause]
Woman:
We have so many schools that are struggling right now, that are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed to represent the city.
Represent all of us.
[Indistinct shouting]
Not them!
All right, that school is nothing but a bunch of rich, spoiled kids.
- It's a...
It's a segregation academy.
- [Indistinct shouting]
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying to make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make this school bigger?
[Scoffs] The hell that they should get to do that!
[Cheers and applause]
They're all... well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it. [Laughter]
May I take the opportunity to distance myself from the remark?
Stand there and say the first stupid thing that falls out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space for public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen than antagonize.
Well, Leslie, you are supposed to be the voice of the school, and I see you just...
Just sit there and take it.
[Chuckles] Let's focus on us, focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event coming up...
A remarkable evening that...
So we just sat through a train wreck, and you want to put on a dress and have a night out?
You have some curious priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
Before we adjourn, I need to make the board aware of something that may or may not be an issue, but it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, for everyone's sake, it's important to maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I...
Legal's been made aware.
Dan Sullivan's questioned his players, so all we can do is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure you're all informed.
Any other business?
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
- Take care.
Thank you.
- Good to see you.
- Take care.
- You too.
- I'll see you next week.
- Bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, I need you to type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding this allegation that, on the record, we say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned by the school, but there is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do the right thing.
We need to say the right thing.
You keep repeating that...
"Say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure and there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, we're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball team, we can't af...
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals for what we do know, but we can't be accountable for what we don't know.
There's nothing more to do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
[Door opens, closes]
- Taylor:
I don't want to go.
- Anne:
I know.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
It's... it's just to make sure you're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not just gonna go away.
Nurse Wells:
Taylor, my name is Nurse Wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's gonna be working with you today.
So, I want to talk with you about how this process works.
But do you have any questions, just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else in the hospital, we start with paperwork and end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you about medications, too.
We've got antibiotics for preventing sexually transmitted infections.
And if that's something that you want to have, we'll get that for you while you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple of different reasons.
One of them is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody might have given you something to knock you out, it could test for that.
We also run a DNA test so that when everything goes to the lab, they can figure out what things belong to you and what things don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam is talking.
You know, I will ask you to tell me what you remember about what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me figure out what I need to be doing with the rest of the exam.
Why do you...
Why do you need to do that?
Why... for what you do?
Why do you... um...
Sorry.
Just, what... why do you need that information?
There's a couple of different reasons.
One of them is because it really helps guide the exam.
If I know what you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for and where I need to look for them.
The other reason why we like to get a history is because it can go into court.
If this ends up going to court, then I can read your words to the jury, and I think that can be a pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, if it's okay with you, is take a look at your anal-genital area for same reasons...
Looking for any kind of injury in that area and also probably taking some swabs in case there might be any DNA to be found there, too.
And that's kind of the long and short of it.
Any questions so far?
No.
Next, I'd like to take a look at your anal area.
So, again, I'm gonna touch on right hip, and come in towards the middle, and just kind of straighten out wrinkles in your skin right here.
And doing...
Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up at the top area.
- [Voice fading] Okay, so, hand back on right hip...
- [Breathing heavily]
And moving in towards center, and fingers right in the middle, and you'll feel a swab right between my fingers.
[ Laughter]
Drink this.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Nurse Wells:
Hey, Anne, why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to follow up with H.I.V. testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think that could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor that you all normally see for things, that's great.
If not, I want to make sure that you get connected with the city clinic for those tests.
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them.
Okay.
I-I think so.
Okay.
If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed.
[Sighs] We did do wash.
We did.
But I don't think they were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, tape it closed, and then give those to the detective.
Oh.
Can I just bring them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go to the police.
I've already been to the police.
Did you talk to a responding officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's usually the person
- who comes out and just takes a statement.
- [Sighs]
Normally you'll follow up with a detective later.
How many people do I have to talk to?
It's a lot.
[Turn signal clicking]
[Tires screech] [Gasps]
Man:
What, you didn't see me?
You didn't see me, huh?
Your dumb ass didn't see me?
You need to learn to drive, bitch.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Hey, you listening to me?
!
Learn to drive!
[Dial tone]
[Dialing]
[Ringing]
Ken:
Indianapolis police.
Detective Williams.
Ken?
It's Terri.
Terri, what's up?
How's Michael?
Good.
He's good.
Uh, listen, Ken, I got into an incident on my way in today.
You okay?
I'm fine.
It's just, the other driver, he was... aggressive.
White guy?
Black guy?
White, of course.
Just really aggressive.
And I got a photo of his license plate, and I was wondering if you could do anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Send it through.
If anything pops up, I'll, uh...
You know, we'll get into it.
Yeah?
You'll take care of it?
Hey, you know what, Terri?
For you...
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Thanks, Ken.

[School bell rings]
[Knock on door]
Hey, uh, bad time?
Just end-of-the-day housekeeping.
It's the kind of world we live in.
[Chuckles] Hey, uh, this is for you.
You... you said some very nice things about me at that fundraiser, and, uh, well, thank you.
Oh.
All deserved.
Wow.
How do you do this?
I know, I know.
You can't tell me your secrets.
[Chuckles] Oh, you know, it's not magic.
It's just patience.
So, listen, Dan, we have to talk.
The incident that happened with the team, we need to close it out, and we need to do it in a way that, if it comes to it, people understand we took it seriously.
Okay.
You need to discipline one of your players.
For what?
For what happened at that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there...
Have you seen the pictures the kids have been texting around?
Suspend the kids that are spreading that crap, but don't take it out on the team.
The mother of the boy has been in this office, and she's been using some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, you know, so she's got to blame somebody.
"Rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that, we have to look thoughtful and responsible.
People think this school is about entitlement.
We have to promote the opposite.
If you make those kids look guilty, then next thing, people are saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned about their feelings.
No, this is not about their feelings.
If those boys want to go play ball in college...
If they even want to go to college...
Even one game, that stays on their record.
You're talking about one player.
I'm talking about the team.
And when people come and they ask us why we didn't do anything about the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding what we're going to do, then we can do what has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game... to prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation in a file that says the player was sat for disciplinary reasons.
[Sighs]
Who am I supposed to sit?
Well, it was the captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit Kevin?
I don't think we want to get into things with the Lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric Tanner.
Whatever you decide, just put it in writing for me, please.
[Indistinct shouting]
Everybody know about this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about Kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing anything to him?
Now we're... we're looking at each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
[Door slams]
Oh, hey, Eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in on the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch said something.
- It's nothing.
- Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything to you.
I know he's running his mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school anymore.
He could still pop off, Kev.
You're the one running your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up and let it be.
Like, let it go.
[Sighs]
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'Cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, nobody's speaking on it.
Y...
You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, all right?
And don't be a bitch about it.
Damn.
[School bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
I don't know.
One of those...
[Laughs]
Come on, girl.
What's up?
Hey, yo, what up?
Lost?
- Hey, st...
- What?
- Go roll up on your own.
- Sean, no.
Back off.
- You guys, st...
- Chris:
Hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, you got a problem?
Nah. [School bell rings]
Then you need to figure out where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight with these two?
Boys being boys?
[Chuckles] Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
You're already late.
Let's not get into an accident.
Monica:
What you're doing is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying to touch HHFK.
Okay, give kids a free breakfast... yes.
But it needs to happen before first period, not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families of different means.
Getting their kids to school before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed is directly related
- to how they perform in class.
- Nobody's arguing about providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking about feeding kids.
This is a civil rights issue.
[Sighs]
What, is that... is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people in this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids don't have rights?
We have a lot to cover tonight.
Does this even have anything to do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here to problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, year in and out.
And we're not talking about if we should be teaching Singapore math or if the reading levels are appropriate.
We are talking about what time to serve the kiddies food.
[Scoffs]
I have three degrees...
Two of them from I.U...
And I feel like a fast-food manager as much as a superintendent.
And Monica...
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's a bleeding heart.
HHFK... good intentions, poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something about it, and you speaking to it, it means something.
I'm just trying to run my school.
Our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, they just want to keep their mouths shut, heads down, let the Unions fight it out with the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working for students?
You need help with your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, my school needs help, and you're talking about grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone to back you.
I need you to back me.
If I can win a few battles, then I can fight some new ones.
Then we can all start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying to get into this.
[Door closes]
What's up?
Terri:
What's up?
Nothing.
Uh, Eric was talking about going to Chicago this weekend...
You have something you want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something you want to tell me?
What is that?
Uh, [Clears throat] a receipt?
For what?
Do I really need to sit here and punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought I didn't check your credit-card receipts, or you thought I would be okay with you
- spending this kind of money?
- Hey, she's my... she's my girl.
How long have you been seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, Kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
[Sighs]
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her a slick bracelet, and because you were so slick, she got back with you and it was all good?
[Sighs]
Are you having sexual relations with her?
Mom, please don't say it like that.
Why...
- Well, how do you want me to say it?
- Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
[Chuckles] Getting busy?
Nobody says any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's... she's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, she could be.
That's how it's gonna be from now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there, they're gonna be coming hard at you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be your baby mama just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time Val was anywhere near $900...
Do you think I'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am I supposed to know?
Well, does her family have any money?
Because if her family has money, then she doesn't want anything from you.
But these other girls, running around here, broke, talking about, "I want some rocks, show me the rocks," I...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those for the WTs, 'cause you're better than that.
You hear what I'm trying to say?
Yeah.
All right, now, you got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep a $900 bracelet.
But I gave it to her already.
What did you buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, Kevin, and you get it back today.
If not, I will go over there myself with the police, because as far as I'm concerned, she stole it.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
The Avedon Arts Building?
The Avedon Library?
[Laughs]
The Avedon [Clears throat] Athletic Center?
I wasn't good at sports.
The Avedon Computer Science Center?
We know you're good at computers.
Yeah.
Look, your school's not really a priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are all our children.
I don't need the fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going to a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity for you to start building your own legacy.
The name that goes on the building is yours, not your father's.
A million dollars for naming rights, for the right to put your name where it matters.
You know a good deal when you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch when I hear one, too.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
Let me think about it.
- Okay.
- Then we'll talk.
- You bet.
- I'll take care of these.
- Okay.
- You know what?
I'm gonna go to that gala of yours.
Put me down for a couple of tickets.
Okay, I will.
[Mumbled] Son of a bitch.
He talked to me like I was 8 years old.
"I went to public school."
The only reason he went to public school is 'cause his dad was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care about come from means, you're not supposed to care about them.
I mean, even someone with money thinks that.
I just... ugh...
Getting sick of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really your career advice?
Is being headmaster really your career?
Capital development is my profession.
But it's not your school, so what do you care if...
Well, I could say it's not your company, so what do you care, except you have a long-term contract.
If people at that place aren't interested enough to put money into it...
"That place"?
This...
Is not a good topic for me.
Never is.
I care about what I do.
What I do is important.
Okay.
Here's the good news.
The goal is in sight.
Then I can learn to like New York and join you at your nameless, faceless, godless institution.
[Chuckles]
We gonna make it through the next year?
We gonna make it through the next year?
I'm not going anywhere.
[Cash register beeping]
[Dan sighs]
Yeah, great.
Fine.
Good.
Well, I think she'd like it.
Look, whatever you get your mom, she's gonna appreciate it.
We should throw her a surprise party.
She doesn't like surprises.
I like surprises, so we should do it.
It is a big birthday for your mom.
I don't know if it's the one we should be experimenting on.
Hey, um...
So, your mom, she wanted me to have a talk with you.
And, you know, just, uh...
You know, just be mindful of guys.
[Laughs]
Hey.
Hey, come on.
You know, guys are gonna be coming at you, and, you know, you need to be...
You need to be smart.
Like use a condom?
No.
No, like...
like don't do anything like it at all.
Well, it's kind of late for that.
To be talking about it.
I've seen porn.
That's where you think you learned about sex?
Well, you didn't talk about it.
Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think you know from a website.
No, I got it from people who know what I'm going through,
- people my age.
- Well, what are you going through?
- Well, what are you going through?
- I'm just...
I'm just going through life.
- Well, what does that mean... "I'm going through"?
- I'm just going through life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.
But so... don't just...
Just don't...
- Every other word... "Don't."
- Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap you see on the Internet or how other people tell you things are is...
It's not that big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.
Okay, it is a big deal if you do something wrong.
And not everybody gets that.
Did you see... you see those pictures that are going around?
The kid from school got drunk at the party?
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Everybody saw those.
Yeah, everybody saw those.
Everybody saw that he's a dumbass, and his life is ruined.
- He got drunk.
That's all.
- $55.54.
Dan:
Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right?
And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him.
Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him.
So, I don't know why you have to assume
I'm gonna do something wrong.
I don't.
I just...
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
You okay?
Why did you show those pictures to my mom?
She already knew about them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, I didn't tell her nothing, 'cause I don't know nothing.
You should have been straight with her, first off.
Why would I tell her anything?
Because she's your mom.
And I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me anymore.
Look, I just don't want to talk about that.
- Are you good?
- I'm...
I just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know if you're good.
You can tell me that, right?
[Sighs]
Damn.
Anne:
They keep blaming Taylor.
"Does he have a problem with drinking?"
"Does he have a problem with drugs?"
"Oh, just... just take him to see someone and go away."
Esposito:
How's Taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage with you at all?
I got him to see a doctor.
But I-I-I think that scared him more than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush to deal with this.
Victims are allowed time to decide if they want to pursue their case.
Well, he waited to say anything, and... and they act like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, and they... they say, you know, you're negligent.
There's a time, there's a window, for victims, when they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, consider it might be better for Taylor to wait until he's ready.
So I should just leave it alone?
You should make sure that what you're doing is having a positive effect on your son.
How are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling overwhelmed, if you feel stressed or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, I'm not fine, but I'm okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
[Cellphone vibrates]
Damn.
Eric.
That thing is sweet.
Yeah.
Wanna drive?
Serious?
Not gonna wreck it, are you?
Hell no, man.
Beat the hell out of that bitch, but I ain't gonna wreck it.
All right, then.
[Tires squealing]
[Engine revving]
[Laughs]
Ow!
[Chuckles]
You're just a rough boy, huh?
You a rough boy, Eric?
No.
[Breathing heavily]
Stop it!
Stop.
I don't like it like that, all right?
What do you like?
I just want to kiss.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor Blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about last Saturday night...
- The party?
- Yeah.
The school's already been in contact with the department.
They gave us a summary of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking that night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something in his drink.
Something what?
GHB?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want...
I don't... that's...
that's... that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need to find out.
You really want to do this to your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category of crime.
Forced intercourse with a member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They... they were taking pictures, there was drinking.
They... they talked about him online.
You can't do something about that?
- That's for the...
- You can't do something with that?
That's for the school to handle.
- Why?
It's a crime.
- Look...
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot to put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, I'm not talking about your son, I'm talking about...
Look, I've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's got a drinking problem or something, you should really try to get him some help.
Okay.
[Door closes]
You go to these people asking for help.
[Ringing] The minute you start talking, you can see it.
They don't believe you.
They... they don't... they won't even call it what it is because they don't think it happens to boys.
Then I start doubting myself.
Maybe I got it wrong.
S-so I go online, and I find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, boys getting assaulted.
It happens more than you think.
I mean, that... that school wants to hide it.
The police want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people to care about my son.
I'm gonna take some notes.
Tell me what you know, and if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing I ask...
Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use his name.
But this article comes out, it's not gonna be hard for people to do the math.
They're gonna know where it's coming from.
So, before you say anything...
Are you sure you want to go public with this?
Yes, I am.
__
Six years ago, the Leyland School was blessed with the arrival of Dan Sullivan.
Four winning seasons, a state championship...
Ms. Blaine, we're suspending Taylor from school.
There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code.
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.
He was really messed up.
We need to talk with Becca.
I do not want her at those parties.
Bitch looking good, huh?
D-damn.
$20,000 a year on that school.
You'd think he'd make better choices.
You know that girl is just...
Oh, I know you're not getting down on the sister.
What were you doing?
!
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!
I had a couple of beers.
Then everything got messed up.
I think someone did something to me.
A student is claiming to have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know that's a lie.
Don't think your kids are above mistakes.
You need to talk to your players.
- What are you doing about what happened to him?
- We've taken disciplinary action
- appropriate to the circumstance...
- What are you doing to those boys?
!
- Tell me what you're doing to the boys!
- The suspension is fair.
As bad as it may seem, it can get worse.
911.
What's your emergency?
I want to report a rape.
Ms. Blaine?
Yes.
Did you call 911?
Last Saturday.
You know the location?
Uh, it was a party.
I'm not sure where.
Exact location's gonna be important to detectives, okay?
Victim's name?
Taylor.
Where's she now?
Taylor's my son.
The victim's a male?
Yes, my son.
And this is a sexual assault?
Yes.
Does your son know the assailant?
It was some other kids at the school.
One kid?
More than one?
He doesn't remember.
He doesn't remember?
Or he's not saying?
he was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son to the hospital, get a rape kit done.
Is your son here?
Yes.
Maybe he should come out and talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, we need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Look, if he's not going to help us, we can't help him.
We have so many schools that are struggling right now, that are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed to represent the city.
Not them!
All right, that school is nothing but a bunch of rich, spoiled kids.
It's a...
It's a segregation academy.
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying to make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make this school bigger?
The hell that they should get to do that!
They're all... well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it.
May I take the opportunity to distance myself from the remark?
Stand there and say the first stupid thing that falls out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space for public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen than antagonize.
Well, Leslie, you are supposed to be the voice of the school, and I see you just...
Just sit there and take it.
Let's focus on us, focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event coming up...
A remarkable evening that...
So we just sat through a train wreck, and you want to put on a dress and have a night out?
You have some curious priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
aware of something that may or may not be an issue, but it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, for everyone's sake, it's important to maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I...
Legal's been made aware.
Dan Sullivan's questioned his players, so all we can do is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure you're all informed.
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
- Take care.
Thank you.
- Good to see you.
- Take care.
- You too.
- I'll see you next week.
- Bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, I need you to type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding this allegation that, on the record, we say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned by the school, but there is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do the right thing.
We need to say the right thing.
You keep repeating that...
"Say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure and there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, we're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball team, we can't af...
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals for what we do know, but we can't be accountable for what we don't know.
There's nothing more to do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
- I don't want to go.
- I know.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
It's... it's just to make sure you're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not just gonna go away.
Taylor, my name is Nurse Wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's gonna be working with you today.
So, I want to talk with you about how this process works.
But do you have any questions, just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else in the hospital, we start with paperwork and end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you about medications, too.
We've got antibiotics for preventing sexually transmitted infections.
And if that's something that you want to have, we'll get that for you while you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple of different reasons.
One of them is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody might have given you something to knock you out, it could test for that.
We also run a DNA test so that when everything goes to the lab, they can figure out what things belong to you and what things don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam is talking.
You know, I will ask you to tell me what you remember about what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me figure out what I need to be doing with the rest of the exam.
Why do you...
Why do you need to do that?
Why... for what you do?
Why do you... um...
Sorry.
Just, what... why do you need that information?
There's a couple of different reasons.
One of them is because it really helps guide the exam.
If I know what you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for and where I need to look for them.
The other reason why we like to get a history is because it can go into court.
If this ends up going to court, then I can read your words to the jury, and I think that can be a pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, if it's okay with you, is take a look at your anal-genital area for same reasons...
Looking for any kind of injury in that area and also probably taking some swabs in case there might be any DNA to be found there, too.
And that's kind of the long and short of it.
No.
Next, I'd like to take a look at your anal area.
So, again, I'm gonna touch on right hip, and come in towards the middle, and just kind of straighten out wrinkles in your skin right here.
And doing...
Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up at the top area.
Okay, so, hand back on right hip...
And moving in towards center, and fingers right in the middle, and you'll feel a swab right between my fingers.
Drink this.
Hey, Anne, why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to follow up with H.I.V. testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think that could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor that you all normally see for things, that's great.
If not, I want to make sure that you get connected with the city clinic for those tests.
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them.
Okay.
I-I think so.
If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed.
We did do wash.
We did.
But I don't think they were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, tape it closed, and then give those to the detective.
Oh.
Can I just bring them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go to the police.
Did you talk to a responding officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's usually the person who comes out and just takes a statement.
Normally you'll follow up with a detective later.
How many people do I have to talk to?
It's a lot.
What, you didn't see me?
You didn't see me, huh?
Your dumb ass didn't see me?
You need to learn to drive, bitch.
Hey, you listening to me?
!
Learn to drive!
Indianapolis police.
Detective Williams.

It's Terri.
Terri, what's up?
How's Michael?
Good.
He's good.
Uh, listen, Ken, I got into an incident on my way in today.
You okay?
I'm fine.
It's just, the other driver, he was... aggressive.
White guy?
Black guy?
White, of course.
Just really aggressive.
And I got a photo of his license plate, and I was wondering if you could do anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Send it through.
If anything pops up, I'll, uh...
You know, we'll get into it.
Yeah?
You'll take care of it?
Hey, you know what, Terri?
For you...
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Thanks, Ken.

Oh.
All deserved.
Wow.
How do you do this?
I know, I know.
You can't tell me your secrets.
So, listen, Dan, we have to talk.
The incident that happened with the team, we need to close it out, and we need to do it in a way that, if it comes to it, people understand we took it seriously.
Okay.
You need to discipline one of your players.
For what?
For what happened at that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there...
Have you seen the pictures the kids have been texting around?
Suspend the kids that are spreading that crap, but don't take it out on the team.
The mother of the boy has been in this office, and she's been using some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, you know, so she's got to blame somebody.
"Rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that, we have to look thoughtful and responsible.
People think this school is about entitlement.
We have to promote the opposite.
If you make those kids look guilty, then next thing, people are saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned about their feelings.
No, this is not about their feelings.
If those boys want to go play ball in college...
If they even want to go to college...
Even one game, that stays on their record.
You're talking about one player.
I'm talking about the team.
And when people come and they ask us why we didn't do anything about the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding what we're going to do, then we can do what has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game... to prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation in a file that says the player was sat for disciplinary reasons.
Who am I supposed to sit?
Well, it was the captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit Kevin?
I don't think we want to get into things with the Lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric Tanner.
Whatever you decide, just put it in writing for me, please.
Everybody know about this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about Kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing anything to him?
Now we're... we're looking at each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
Oh, hey, Eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in on the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch said something.
- It's nothing.
- Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything to you.
I know he's running his mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school anymore.
He could still pop off, Kev.
You're the one running your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up and let it be.
Like, let it go.
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'Cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, nobody's speaking on it.
Y...
You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, all right?
And don't be a bitch about it.
Damn.
I don't know.
One of those...
Come on, girl.
What's up?
Lost?
- Hey, st...
- What?
- Go roll up on your own.
- Sean, no.
Back off.
- You guys, st...
- Hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, you got a problem?
Nah.
Then you need to figure out where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight with these two?
Boys being boys?
Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
Let's not get into an accident.
What you're doing is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying to touch HHFK.
Okay, give kids a free breakfast... yes.
But it needs to happen before first period, not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families of different means.
Getting their kids to school before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed is directly related
- to how they perform in class.
- Nobody's arguing about providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking about feeding kids.
This is a civil rights issue.
What, is that... is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people in this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids don't have rights?
We have a lot to cover tonight.
Does this even have anything to do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here to problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, year in and out.
And we're not talking about if we should be teaching Singapore math or if the reading levels are appropriate.
We are talking about what time to serve the kiddies food.
I have three degrees...
Two of them from I.U...
And I feel like a fast-food manager as much as a superintendent.
And Monica...
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's a bleeding heart.
HHFK... good intentions, poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something about it, and you speaking to it, it means something.
Our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, they just want to keep their mouths shut, heads down, let the Unions fight it out with the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working for students?
You need help with your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, my school needs help, and you're talking about grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone to back you.
I need you to back me.
If I can win a few battles, then I can fight some new ones.
Then we can all start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying to get into this.
What's up?
Nothing.
Uh, Eric was talking about going to Chicago this weekend...
You have something you want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something you want to tell me?
What is that?
Uh, a receipt?
For what?
Do I really need to sit here and punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought I didn't check your credit-card receipts, or you thought I would be okay with you
- spending this kind of money?
- Hey, she's my... she's my girl.
How long have you been seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, Kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her a slick bracelet, and because you were so slick, she got back with you and it was all good?
Are you having sexual relations with her?
Mom, please don't say it like that.
Why...
- Well, how do you want me to say it?
- Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
Getting busy?
Nobody says any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's... she's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, she could be.
That's how it's gonna be from now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there, they're gonna be coming hard at you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be your baby mama just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time Val was anywhere near $900...
Do you think I'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am I supposed to know?
Well, does her family have any money?
Because if her family has money, then she doesn't want anything from you.
But these other girls, running around here, broke, talking about, "I want some rocks, show me the rocks," I...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those for the WTs, 'cause you're better than that.
You hear what I'm trying to say?
Yeah.
All right, now, you got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep a $900 bracelet.
What did you buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, Kevin, and you get it back today.
If not, I will go over there myself with the police, because as far as I'm concerned, she stole it.
The Avedon Arts Building?
The Avedon Library?
The Avedon Athletic Center?
I wasn't good at sports.
The Avedon Computer Science Center?
We know you're good at computers.
Yeah.
Look, your school's not really a priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are all our children.
I don't need the fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going to a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity for you to start building your own legacy.
The name that goes on the building is yours, not your father's.
A million dollars for naming rights, for the right to put your name where it matters.
You know a good deal when you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch when I hear one, too.
Okay.
Let me think about it.
- Okay.
- Then we'll talk.
- You bet.
- I'll take care of these.
- Okay.
- You know what?
I'm gonna go to that gala of yours.
Put me down for a couple of tickets.
Okay, I will.
Son of a bitch.
He talked to me like I was 8 years old.
"I went to public school."
The only reason he went to public school is 'cause his dad was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care about come from means, you're not supposed to care about them.
I mean, even someone with money thinks that.
I just... ugh...
Getting sick of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really your career advice?
Is being headmaster really your career?
Capital development is my profession.
But it's not your school, so what do you care if...
Well, I could say it's not your company, so what do you care, except you have a long-term contract.
If people at that place aren't interested enough to put money into it...
"That place"?
This...
Is not a good topic for me.
Never is.
I care about what I do.
What I do is important.
Okay.
Here's the good news.
The goal is in sight.
Then I can learn to like New York and join you at your nameless, faceless, godless institution.
We gonna make it through the next year?
We gonna make it through the next year?
I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah, great.
Fine.
Good.
Well, I think she'd like it.
Look, whatever you get your mom, she's gonna appreciate it.
We should throw her a surprise party.
She doesn't like surprises.
I like surprises, so we should do it.
It is a big birthday for your mom.
I don't know if it's the one we should be experimenting on.
Hey, um...
So, your mom, she wanted me to have a talk with you.
And, you know, just, uh...
You know, just be mindful of guys.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
You know, guys are gonna be coming at you, and, you know, you need to be...
You need to be smart.
Like use a condom?
No.
No, like...
like don't do anything like it at all.
Well, it's kind of late for that.
To be talking about it.
I've seen porn.
That's where you think you learned about sex?
Well, you didn't talk about it.
Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think you know from a website.
No, I got it from people who know what I'm going through,
- people my age.
- Well, what are you going through?
- Well, what are you going through?
- I'm just...
I'm just going through life.
- Well, what does that mean... "I'm going through"?
- I'm just going through life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.
But so... don't just...
Just don't...
- Every other word... "Don't."
- Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap you see on the Internet or how other people tell you things are is...
It's not that big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.
Okay, it is a big deal if you do something wrong.
And not everybody gets that.
Did you see... you see those pictures that are going around?
The kid from school got drunk at the party?
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Everybody saw those.
Yeah, everybody saw those.
Everybody saw that he's a dumbass, and his life is ruined.
- He got drunk.
That's all.
- $55.54.
Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right?
And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him.
Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him.
So, I don't know why you have to assume
I'm gonna do something wrong.
I don't.
I just...
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
You okay?
Why did you show those pictures to my mom?
She already knew about them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, I didn't tell her nothing, 'cause I don't know nothing.
You should have been straight with her, first off.
Why would I tell her anything?
Because she's your mom.
And I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me anymore.
Look, I just don't want to talk about that.
- Are you good?
- I'm...
I just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know if you're good.
You can tell me that, right?
Damn.
They keep blaming Taylor.
"Does he have a problem with drinking?"
"Does he have a problem with drugs?"
"Oh, just... just take him to see someone and go away."
How's Taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage with you at all?
I got him to see a doctor.
But I-I-I think that scared him more than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush to deal with this.
Victims are allowed time to decide if they want to pursue their case.
Well, he waited to say anything, and... and they act like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, and they... they say, you know, you're negligent.
There's a time, there's a window, for victims, when they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, consider it might be better for Taylor to wait until he's ready.
So I should just leave it alone?
You should make sure that what you're doing is having a positive effect on your son.
How are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling overwhelmed, if you feel stressed or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, I'm not fine, but I'm okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Damn.
Eric.
That thing is sweet.
Yeah.
Wanna drive?
Serious?
Not gonna wreck it, are you?
Hell no, man.
Beat the hell out of that bitch, but I ain't gonna wreck it.
All right, then.
Ow!
You're just a rough boy, huh?
You a rough boy, Eric?
No.
Stop it!
Stop.
I don't like it like that, all right?
What do you like?
I just want to kiss.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor Blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about last Saturday night...
- The party?
- Yeah.
The school's already been in contact with the department.
They gave us a summary of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking that night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something in his drink.
Something what?
GHB?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want...
I don't... that's...
that's... that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need to find out.
You really want to do this to your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category of crime.
Forced intercourse with a member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They... they were taking pictures, there was drinking.
They... they talked about him online.
You can't do something about that?
- That's for the...
- You can't do something with that?
That's for the school to handle.
- Why?
It's a crime.
- Look...
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot to put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, I'm not talking about your son, I'm talking about...
Look, I've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's got a drinking problem or something, you should really try to get him some help.
Okay.
You go to these people asking for help.
The minute you start talking, you can see it.
They don't believe you.
They... they don't... they won't even call it what it is because they don't think it happens to boys.
Then I start doubting myself.
Maybe I got it wrong.
S-so I go online, and I find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, boys getting assaulted.
It happens more than you think.
I mean, that... that school wants to hide it.
The police want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people to care about my son.
I'm gonna take some notes.
Tell me what you know, and if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing I ask...
Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use his name.
But this article comes out, it's not gonna be hard for people to do the math.
They're gonna know where it's coming from.
So, before you say anything...
Are you sure you want to go public with this?
Yes, I am.
__
Six years ago, the Leyland School was blessed with the arrival of Dan Sullivan.
Four winning seasons, a state championship...
Ms. Blaine, we're suspending Taylor from school.
There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code.
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.
He was really messed up.
We need to talk with Becca.
I do not want her at those parties.
Bitch looking good, huh?
D-damn.
Terri: $20,000 a year on that school.
You'd think he'd make better choices.
You know that girl is just...
Oh, I know you're not getting down on the sister.
Anne:
What were you doing?
!
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!
I had a couple of beers.
Then everything got messed up.
I think someone did something to me.
A student is claiming to have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know that's a lie.
Don't think your kids are above mistakes.
You need to talk to your players.
- What are you doing about what happened to him?
- We've taken disciplinary action
- appropriate to the circumstance...
- What are you doing to those boys?
!
- Tell me what you're doing to the boys!
- The suspension is fair.
As bad as it may seem, it can get worse.
Man: 911.
What's your emergency?
I want to report a rape.
Roberts:
Ms. Blaine?
Yes.
Did you call 911?
When did the assault take place?
Last Saturday.
You know the location?
Uh, it was a party.
I'm not sure where.
Exact location's gonna be important to detectives, okay?
Victim's name?
Taylor.
Where's she now?
Taylor's my son.
The victim's a male?
Yes, my son.
And this is a sexual assault?
Yes.
Does your son know the assailant?
It was some other kids at the school.
One kid?
More than one?
He doesn't remember.
He doesn't remember?
Or he's not saying?
he was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son to the hospital, get a rape kit done.
Sanders:
Is your son here?
Yes.
Maybe he should come out and talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, we need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Look, if he's not going to help us, we can't help him.
[Sighs]
[Indistinct shouting, scattered applause]
Woman:
We have so many schools that are struggling right now, that are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed to represent the city.
Represent all of us.
[Indistinct shouting]
Not them!
All right, that school is nothing but a bunch of rich, spoiled kids.
- It's a...
It's a segregation academy.
- [Indistinct shouting]
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying to make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make this school bigger?
[Scoffs] The hell that they should get to do that!
[Cheers and applause]
They're all... well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it. [Laughter]
May I take the opportunity to distance myself from the remark?
Stand there and say the first stupid thing that falls out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space for public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen than antagonize.
Well, Leslie, you are supposed to be the voice of the school, and I see you just...
Just sit there and take it.
[Chuckles] Let's focus on us, focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event coming up...
A remarkable evening that...
So we just sat through a train wreck, and you want to put on a dress and have a night out?
You have some curious priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
Before we adjourn, I need to make the board aware of something that may or may not be an issue, but it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, for everyone's sake, it's important to maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I...
Legal's been made aware.
Dan Sullivan's questioned his players, so all we can do is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure you're all informed.
Any other business?
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
- Take care.
Thank you.
- Good to see you.
- Take care.
- You too.
- I'll see you next week.
- Bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, I need you to type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding this allegation that, on the record, we say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned by the school, but there is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do the right thing.
We need to say the right thing.
You keep repeating that...
"Say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure and there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, we're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball team, we can't af...
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals for what we do know, but we can't be accountable for what we don't know.
There's nothing more to do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
[Door opens, closes]
- Taylor:
I don't want to go.
- Anne:
I know.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
It's... it's just to make sure you're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not just gonna go away.
Nurse Wells:
Taylor, my name is Nurse Wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's gonna be working with you today.
So, I want to talk with you about how this process works.
But do you have any questions, just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else in the hospital, we start with paperwork and end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you about medications, too.
We've got antibiotics for preventing sexually transmitted infections.
And if that's something that you want to have, we'll get that for you while you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple of different reasons.
One of them is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody might have given you something to knock you out, it could test for that.
We also run a DNA test so that when everything goes to the lab, they can figure out what things belong to you and what things don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam is talking.
You know, I will ask you to tell me what you remember about what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me figure out what I need to be doing with the rest of the exam.
Why do you...
Why do you need to do that?
Why... for what you do?
Why do you... um...
Sorry.
Just, what... why do you need that information?
There's a couple of different reasons.
One of them is because it really helps guide the exam.
If I know what you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for and where I need to look for them.
The other reason why we like to get a history is because it can go into court.
If this ends up going to court, then I can read your words to the jury, and I think that can be a pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, if it's okay with you, is take a look at your anal-genital area for same reasons...
Looking for any kind of injury in that area and also probably taking some swabs in case there might be any DNA to be found there, too.
And that's kind of the long and short of it.
Any questions so far?
No.
Next, I'd like to take a look at your anal area.
So, again, I'm gonna touch on right hip, and come in towards the middle, and just kind of straighten out wrinkles in your skin right here.
And doing...
Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up at the top area.
- [Voice fading] Okay, so, hand back on right hip...
- [Breathing heavily]
And moving in towards center, and fingers right in the middle, and you'll feel a swab right between my fingers.
[ Laughter]
Drink this.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Nurse Wells:
Hey, Anne, why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to follow up with H.I.V. testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think that could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor that you all normally see for things, that's great.
If not, I want to make sure that you get connected with the city clinic for those tests.
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them.
Okay.
I-I think so.
Okay.
If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed.
[Sighs] We did do wash.
We did.
But I don't think they were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, tape it closed, and then give those to the detective.
Oh.
Can I just bring them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go to the police.
I've already been to the police.
Did you talk to a responding officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's usually the person
- who comes out and just takes a statement.
- [Sighs]
Normally you'll follow up with a detective later.
How many people do I have to talk to?
It's a lot.
[Turn signal clicking]
[Tires screech] [Gasps]
Man:
What, you didn't see me?
You didn't see me, huh?
Your dumb ass didn't see me?
You need to learn to drive, bitch.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Hey, you listening to me?
!
Learn to drive!
[Dial tone]
[Dialing]
[Ringing]
Ken:
Indianapolis police.
Detective Williams.
Ken?
It's Terri.
Terri, what's up?
How's Michael?
Good.
He's good.
Uh, listen, Ken, I got into an incident on my way in today.
You okay?
I'm fine.
It's just, the other driver, he was... aggressive.
White guy?
Black guy?
White, of course.
Just really aggressive.
And I got a photo of his license plate, and I was wondering if you could do anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Send it through.
If anything pops up, I'll, uh...
You know, we'll get into it.
Yeah?
You'll take care of it?
Hey, you know what, Terri?
For you...
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Thanks, Ken.

[School bell rings]
[Knock on door]
Hey, uh, bad time?
Just end-of-the-day housekeeping.
It's the kind of world we live in.
[Chuckles] Hey, uh, this is for you.
You... you said some very nice things about me at that fundraiser, and, uh, well, thank you.
Oh.
All deserved.
Wow.
How do you do this?
I know, I know.
You can't tell me your secrets.
[Chuckles] Oh, you know, it's not magic.
It's just patience.
So, listen, Dan, we have to talk.
The incident that happened with the team, we need to close it out, and we need to do it in a way that, if it comes to it, people understand we took it seriously.
Okay.
You need to discipline one of your players.
For what?
For what happened at that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there...
Have you seen the pictures the kids have been texting around?
Suspend the kids that are spreading that crap, but don't take it out on the team.
The mother of the boy has been in this office, and she's been using some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, you know, so she's got to blame somebody.
"Rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that, we have to look thoughtful and responsible.
People think this school is about entitlement.
We have to promote the opposite.
If you make those kids look guilty, then next thing, people are saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned about their feelings.
No, this is not about their feelings.
If those boys want to go play ball in college...
If they even want to go to college...
Even one game, that stays on their record.
You're talking about one player.
I'm talking about the team.
And when people come and they ask us why we didn't do anything about the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding what we're going to do, then we can do what has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game... to prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation in a file that says the player was sat for disciplinary reasons.
[Sighs]
Who am I supposed to sit?
Well, it was the captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit Kevin?
I don't think we want to get into things with the Lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric Tanner.
Whatever you decide, just put it in writing for me, please.
[Indistinct shouting]
Everybody know about this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about Kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing anything to him?
Now we're... we're looking at each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
[Door slams]
Oh, hey, Eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in on the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch said something.
- It's nothing.
- Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything to you.
I know he's running his mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school anymore.
He could still pop off, Kev.
You're the one running your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up and let it be.
Like, let it go.
[Sighs]
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'Cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, nobody's speaking on it.
Y...
You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, all right?
And don't be a bitch about it.
Damn.
[School bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
I don't know.
One of those...
[Laughs]
Come on, girl.
What's up?
Hey, yo, what up?
Lost?
- Hey, St...
- What?
- Go roll up on your own.
- Sean, no.
Back off.
- You guys, St...
- Chris:
Hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, you got a problem?
Nah. [School bell rings]
Then you need to figure out where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight with these two?
Boys being boys?
[Chuckles] Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
You're already late.
Let's not get into an accident.
Monica:
What you're doing is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying to touch HHFK.
Okay, give kids a free breakfast... yes.
But it needs to happen before first period, not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families of different means.
Getting their kids to school before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed is directly related
- to how they perform in class.
- Nobody's arguing about providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking about feeding kids.
This is a civil rights issue.
[Sighs]
What, is that... is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people in this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids don't have rights?
We have a lot to cover tonight.
Does this even have anything to do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here to problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, year in and out.
And we're not talking about if we should be teaching Singapore math or if the reading levels are appropriate.
We are talking about what time to serve the kiddies food.
[Scoffs]
I have three degrees...
Two of them from I.U...
And I feel like a fast-food manager as much as a superintendent.
And Monica...
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's a bleeding heart.
HHFK... good intentions, poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something about it, and you speaking to it, it means something.
I'm just trying to run my school.
Our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, they just want to keep their mouths shut, heads down, let the Unions fight it out with the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working for students?
You need help with your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, my school needs help, and you're talking about grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone to back you.
I need you to back me.
If I can win a few battles, then I can fight some new ones.
Then we can all start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying to get into this.
[Door closes]
What's up?
Terri:
What's up?
Nothing.
Uh, Eric was talking about going to Chicago this weekend...
You have something you want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something you want to tell me?
What is that?
Uh, [Clears throat] a receipt?
For what?
Do I really need to sit here and punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought I didn't check your credit-card receipts, or you thought I would be okay with you
- spending this kind of money?
- Hey, she's my... she's my girl.
How long have you been seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, Kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
[Sighs]
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her a slick bracelet, and because you were so slick, she got back with you and it was all good?
[Sighs]
Are you having sexual relations with her?
Mom, please don't say it like that.
Why...
- Well, how do you want me to say it?
- Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
[Chuckles] Getting busy?
Nobody says any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's... she's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, she could be.
That's how it's gonna be from now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there, they're gonna be coming hard at you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be your baby mama just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time Val was anywhere near $900...
Do you think I'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am I supposed to know?
Well, does her family have any money?
Because if her family has money, then she doesn't want anything from you.
But these other girls, running around here, broke, talking about, "I want me some rocks, show me the rocks," I...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those for the WTs, 'cause you're better than that.
You hear what I'm trying to say?
Yeah.
All right, now, you got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep a $900 bracelet.
But I gave it to her already.
What did you buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, Kevin, and you get it back today.
If not, I will go over there myself with the police, because as far as I'm concerned, she stole it.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
The Avedon Arts Building?
The Avedon Library?
[Laughs]
The Avedon [Clears throat] Athletic Center?
I wasn't good at sports.
The Avedon Computer Science Center?
We know you're good at computers.
Yeah.
Look, your school's not really a priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are all our children.
I don't need the fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going to a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity for you to start building your own legacy.
The name that goes on the building is yours, not your father's.
A million dollars for naming rights, for the right to put your name where it matters.
You know a good deal when you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch when I hear one, too.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
Let me think about it.
- Okay.
- Then we'll talk.
- You bet.
- I'll take care of these.
- Okay.
- You know what?
I'm gonna go to that gala of yours.
Put me down for a couple of tickets.
Okay, I will.
[Mumbled] Son of a bitch.
He talked to me like I was 8 years old.
"I went to public school."
The only reason he went to public school is 'cause his dad was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care about come from means, you're not supposed to care about them.
I mean, even someone with money thinks that.
I just... ugh...
Getting sick of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really your career advice?
Is being headmaster really your career?
Capital development is my profession.
But it's not your school, so what do you care if...
Well, I could say it's not your company, so what do you care, except you have a long-term contract.
If people at that place aren't interested enough to put money into it...
"That place"?
This...
Is not a good topic for me.
Never is.
I care about what I do.
What I do is important.
Okay.
Here's the good news.
The goal is in sight.
Then I can learn to like New York and join you at your nameless, faceless, godless institution.
[Chuckles]
We gonna make it through the next year?
We gonna make it through the next year?
I'm not going anywhere.
[Cash register beeping]
[Dan sighs]
Yeah, great.
Fine.
Good.
Well, I think she'd like it.
Look, whatever you get your mom, she's gonna appreciate it.
We should throw her a surprise party.
She doesn't like surprises.
I like surprises, so we should do it.
It is a big birthday for your mom.
I don't know if it's the one we should be experimenting on.
Hey, um...
So, your mom, she wanted me to have a talk with you.
And, you know, just, uh...
You know, just be mindful of guys.
[Laughs]
Hey.
Hey, come on.
You know, guys are gonna be coming at you, and, you know, you need to be...
You need to be smart.
Like use a condom?
No.
No, like...
like don't do anything like it at all.
Well, it's kind of late for that.
To be talking about it.
I've seen porn.
That's where you think you learned about sex?
Well, you didn't talk about it.
Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think you know from a website.
No, I got it from people who know what I'm going through,
- people my age.
- Well, what are you going through?
- Well, what are you going through?
- I'm just...
I'm just going through life.
- Well, what does that mean... "I'm going through"?
- I'm just going through life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.
But so... don't just...
Just don't...
- Every other word... "Don't."
- Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap you see on the Internet or how other people tell you things are is...
It's not that big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.
Okay, it is a big deal if you do something wrong.
And not everybody gets that.
Did you see... you see those pictures that are going around?
The kid from school got drunk at the party?
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Everybody saw those.
Yeah, everybody saw those.
Everybody saw that he's a dumbass, and his life is ruined.
- He got drunk.
That's all.
- $55.54.
Dan:
Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right?
And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him.
Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him.
So, I don't know why you have to assume
I'm gonna do something wrong.
I don't.
I just...
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
You okay?
Why did you show those pictures to my mom?
She already knew about them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, I didn't tell her nothing, 'cause I don't know nothing.
You should have been straight with her, first off.
Why would I tell her anything?
Because she's your mom.
And I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me anymore.
Look, I just don't want to talk about that.
- Are you good?
- I'm...
I just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know if you're good.
You can tell me that, right?
[Sighs]
Damn.
Anne:
They keep blaming Taylor.
"Does he have a problem with drinking?"
"Does he have a problem with drugs?"
"Oh, just... just take him to see someone and go away."
Esposito:
How's Taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage with you at all?
I got him to see a doctor.
But I-I-I think that scared him more than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush to deal with this.
Victims are allowed time to decide if they want to pursue their case.
Well, he waited to say anything, and... and they act like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, and they... they say, you know, you're negligent.
There's a time, there's a window, for victims, when they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, consider it might be better for Taylor to wait until he's ready.
So I should just leave it alone?
You should make sure that what you're doing is having a positive effect on your son.
How are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling overwhelmed, if you feel stressed or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, I'm not fine, but I'm okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
[Cellphone vibrates]
Damn.
Eric.
That thing is sweet.
Yeah.
Wanna drive?
Serious?
Not gonna wreck it, are you?
Hell no, man.
Beat the hell out of that bitch, but I ain't gonna wreck it.
All right, then.
[Tires squealing]
[Engine revving]
[Laughs]
Ow!
[Chuckles]
You're just a rough boy, huh?
You a rough boy, Eric?
No.
[Breathing heavily]
Stop it!
Stop.
I don't like it like that, all right?
What do you like?
I just want to kiss.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor Blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about last Saturday night...
- The party?
- Yeah.
The school's already been in contact with the department.
They gave us a summary of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking that night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something in his drink.
Something what?
GHB?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want...
I don't... that's...
that's... that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need to find out.
You really want to do this to your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category of crime.
Forced intercourse with a member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They... they were taking pictures, there was drinking.
They... they talked about him online.
You can't do something about that?
- That's for the...
- You can't do something with that?
That's for the school to handle.
- Why?
It's a crime.
- Look...
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot to put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, I'm not talking about your son, I'm talking about...
Look, I've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's got a drinking problem or something, you should really try to get him some help.
Okay.
[Door closes]
You go to these people asking for help.
[Ringing] The minute you start talking, you can see it.
They don't believe you.
They... they don't... they won't even call it what it is because they don't think it happens to boys.
Then I start doubting myself.
Maybe I got it wrong.
S-so I go online, and I find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, boys getting assaulted.
It happens more than you think.
I mean, that... that school wants to hide it.
The police want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people to care about my son.
I'm gonna take some notes.
Tell me what you know, and if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing I ask...
Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use his name.
But this article comes out, it's not gonna be hard for people to do the math.
They're gonna know where it's coming from.
So, before you say anything...
Are you sure you want to go public with this?
Yes, I am.
Six years ago, The leyland school was blessed
With the arrival Of dan sullivan.
Four winning seasons, A state championship.
Ms. Blaine, we're Suspending taylor from school.

What were you doing?
!
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!
I had a couple Of beers.
Then everything Got messed up.
I think Someone did something to me.
A student is claiming To have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know That's a lie.
Don't think your kids Are above mistakes.
You need To talk to your players.
What are you doing About what happened to him?
We've taken Disciplinary action
Appropriate To the circumstance -- What are you doing To those boys?
!
Tell me what you're doing To the boys!
The suspension is fair.
As bad as it may seem, It can get worse.

Ms. Blaine?
Yes.
Did you call 911?

Where's she now?
Taylor's my son.
The victim's a male?
Yes.
My son.
And this Is a sexual assault?
Yes.
Does your son Know the assailant?
It was some other kids At the school.
One kid?
More than one?
He doesn't remember.
Doesn't remember, Or is not saying?
He was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son To the hospital,
Get a rape kit done.
Is your son here?
Yes.
Maybe he should come out And talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, We need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk About it.
Look, if he's not going to Help us, we can't help him.
We have so many schools That are struggling right now,
That are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed To represent the city.
Represent all of us.
Not them!
All right, that school
Is nothing but a bunch of rich, Spoiled kids.
It's a -- It's a segregation academy.
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying To make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make This school bigger?
The hell That they should get to do that!
They're all -- well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it.
May i take the opportunity
To distance myself From the remark?
Stand there and say The first stupid thing
That falls Out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space For public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, Comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry Because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen Than antagonize.
Well, leslie, you are supposed To be the voice of the school,
And i see you just -- Just sit there and take it.
Let's focus on us, Focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event Coming up --
A remarkable evening that --
So we just sat Through a train wreck,
And you want to put on a dress And have a night out?
You have some curious Priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
Before we adjourn, I need to make the board
Aware of something That may or may not be an issue,
But it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made Against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, For everyone's sake,
It's important To maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I --
Legal's been made aware.
Dan sullivan's Questioned his players,
So all we can do Is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure You're all informed.
Any other business?
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
-take care.
Thank you.
-good to see you.
-take care.
-you too.
-i'll see you next week.
-bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, i need you To type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding This allegation
That, on the record, We say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned By the school,
But there Is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do The right thing.
We need to say The right thing.
You keep repeating that -- "say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure And there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, We're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite Of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support Promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball Team, we can't af--
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals For what we do know,
But we can't be accountable For what we don't know.
There's nothing more To do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want to go.
i know.
I don't want to talk To anybody.
It's -- it's just to make sure You're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act Like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not Just gonna go away.
Taylor, my name is nurse wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's Gonna be working with you today.
So, i want to talk with you About how this process works.
But do you have any questions, Just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, Please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else In the hospital,
We start with paperwork And end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you About medications, too.
We've got antibiotics For preventing
Sexually transmitted Infections.
And if that's something That you want to have,
We'll get that for you While you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple Of different reasons.
One of them Is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody Might have given you
Something to knock you out, It could test for that.
We also run a dna test
So that when everything Goes to the lab,
They can figure out What things belong to you
And what things Don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons Why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam Is talking.
You know, i will ask you To tell me what you remember
About what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me Figure out
What i need to be doing With the rest of the exam.
Why do you -- Why do you need to do that?
Why -- for what you do?
Why do you -- um...
Sorry.
Just, what -- why do you Need that information?
There's a couple Of different reasons.
One of them is because It really helps guide the exam.
If i know What you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for
And where i need to look For them.
The other reason Why we like to get a history
Is because it can go Into court.
If this ends up Going to court,
Then i can read your words To the jury,
And i think that can be A pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, If it's okay with you,
Is take a look At your anal-genital area
For same reasons -- Looking for any kind of injury
In that area and also Probably taking some swabs
In case there might be Any dna to be found there, too.
And that's kind of The long and short of it.
Any questions so far?
No.
Next, i'd like to take a look At your anal area.
So, again, i'm gonna touch On right hip,
And come in Towards the middle,
And just kind of Straighten out
Wrinkles in your skin Right here.
And doing -- Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up At the top area.
Okay, so, Hand back on right hip And moving in Towards center,
And fingers Right in the middle,
And you'll feel a swab Right between my fingers.
drink this.
Hey, anne, Why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to Follow up with h.I.V. Testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think That could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of Situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor
That you all normally see For things, that's great.
If not, i want to make sure That you get connected
With the city clinic For those tests.
-okay?
-okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask About the clothes
That he was wearing that night And if he still has them.
Okay.
I-i think so.
Okay.
If y'all haven't Washed them yet,
Put them in a paper bag And just tape it closed.
We did do wash.
We did.
But i don't think They were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, Tape it closed,
And then give those To the detective.
Oh.
Can i just bring Them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go To the police.
I've already been To the police.
Did you talk to a responding Officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's Usually the person
Who comes out And just takes a statement.
Normally you'll follow up With a detective later.
How many people Do i have to talk to?
It's a lot.

People understand We took it seriously.

For what happened At that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there --
Have you seen The pictures
The kids Have been texting around?
Suspend the kids That are spreading that crap,

The mother of the boy Has been in this office,
And she's been using Some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, You know,
So she's got to blame Somebody.
"rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that,
We have to look thoughtful And responsible.
People think this school Is about entitlement.
We have to promote The opposite.
If you make those kids Look guilty,
Then next thing, people are Saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned About their feelings.
No, this is not About their feelings.
If those boys want to go play Ball in college --
If they even want to go To college --
Even one game, That stays on their record.
You're talking About one player.
I'm talking About the team.
And when people come And they ask us
Why we didn't do anything About the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding What we're going to do,
Then we can do What has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game -- To prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation In a file
That says the player was sat For disciplinary reasons.
Who am i supposed to sit?
Well, it was The captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit kevin?
I don't think We want to get into things
With the lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric tanner.
Whatever you decide,
Just put it in writing For me, please.
Everybody know About this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing Anything to him?
Now we're -- we're looking At each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
Oh, hey, eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in On the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch Said something.
It's nothing.
Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything To you.
I know he's running His mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school Anymore.
He could still Pop off, kev.
You're the one running Your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up And let it be.
Like, let it go.
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, Nobody's speaking on it.
Y-- You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, All right?
And don't be a bitch About it.
Damn.
What's up?
Hey, yo, what up?
Lost?
Hey, st-- What?
Go roll up on your own.
Sean, no.
Back off.
You guys, st- hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, You got a problem?
Nah.
Then you need to figure out Where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight With these two?
Boys being boys?
Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging Out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
You're already late.
Let's not get Into an accident.
What you're doing Is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take Food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying To touch hhfk.
Okay, give kids A free breakfast -- yes.
But it needs to happen Before first period,
Not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families Of different means.
Getting their kids to school Before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed Is directly related
To how they perform in class.
Nobody's arguing about Providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about Is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking About feeding kids.
This is A civil rights issue.
What, is that -- Is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people In this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt Don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids Don't have rights?
We have a lot To cover tonight.
Does this even have anything To do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here To problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, Year in and out.
And we're not Talking about
If we should be teaching Singapore math
Or if the reading levels Are appropriate.
We are talking about what time To serve the kiddies food.
I have three degrees -- Two of them from i.U. --
And i feel like A fast-food manager
As much As a superintendent.
And monica --
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's A bleeding heart.
Hhfk -- good intentions, Poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something About it,
And you speaking to it, It means something.
I'm just trying to run My school.
our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, They just want to keep
Their mouths shut, Heads down,
Let the unions fight it out With the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working For students?
You need help With your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, My school needs help,
And you're talking About grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone To back you.
I need you to back me.
If i can win a few battles, Then i can fight some new ones.
Then we can all Start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying To get into this.
What's up?
what's up?
Nothing.
Uh, eric was talking about going To chicago this weekend --
You have something You want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something You want to tell me?
What is that?
A receipt?
For what?
Do i really need to sit here And punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought i didn't check Your credit-card receipts,
Or you thought I would be okay with you
-spending this kind of money?
-hey, she's my -- she's my girl.
How long have you been Seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was Gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her A slick bracelet,
And because you were So slick,
She got back with you And it was all good?
Are you having sexual relations With her?
Mom, please don't say it Like that.
Why --
Well, how do you Want me to say it?
Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
Getting busy?
Nobody says Any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's -- She's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, She could be.
That's how it's gonna be From now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there,
They're gonna be coming hard At you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be Your baby mama
Just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time val Was anywhere near $900 --
Do you think i'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here Are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am i Supposed to know?
Well, does her family Have any money?
Because if her family Has money,
Then she doesn't want Anything from you.
But these other girls, Running around here, broke,
Talking about, "i want me some rocks,
Show me the rocks," i...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those For the wts, 'cause you're better Than that.
You hear What i'm trying to say?
Yeah.
All right, now, You got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep A $900 bracelet.
But i gave it To her already.
What did you Buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, kevin, And you get it back today.
If not, i will go over there Myself with the police,
Because as far as i'm concerned, She stole it.
The avedon arts building?
The avedon library?
The avedon Athletic center?
I wasn't good at sports.
The avedon Computer science center?
We know you're good At computers.
Yeah.
Look, your school's not really A priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are All our children.
I don't need The fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going To a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity For you to start building
Your own legacy.
The name that goes On the building is yours,
Not your father's.
A million dollars For naming rights,
For the right to put your name Where it matters.
You know a good deal When you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch When i hear one, too.
Okay.
Let me think about it.

I'm gonna go To that gala of yours.
Put me down For a couple of tickets.
Okay, i will.
Son of a bitch.
He talked to me Like i was 8 years old.
"i went to public school."
The only reason He went to public school
Is 'cause his dad Was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician Whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care About come from means,
You're not supposed to care About them.
I mean, even someone with money Thinks that.
I just -- ugh --
Getting sick Of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really Your career advice?
Is being headmaster Really your career?
Capital development Is my profession.
But it's not your school, So what do you care if --
Well, i could say It's not your company,
So what do you care,
Except you have A long-term contract.
If people at that place Aren't interested enough To put money into it --
"that place"?
This...
Is not a good topic For me.
Never is.
I care about what i do.
What i do is important.
Okay.
Here's the good news.
The goal is in sight.
Then i can learn To like new york

We should throw her A surprise party.
She doesn't like surprises.
I like surprises, So we should do it.
It is a big birthday For your mom.
I don't know if it's the one We should be experimenting on.
Hey, um...
So, your mom, she wanted me To have a talk with you.
And, you know, Just, uh --
You know, Just be mindful of guys.

You know, Guys are gonna be coming at you,
And, you know, You need to be...
You need to be smart.

Well, it's kind of late For that.
To be talking about it.
I've seen porn.
That's where you think You learned about sex?
Well, you didn't Talk about it.
Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think You know from a website.
No, i got it from people Who know what i'm going through,
People my age.
Well, what are you Going through?
Well, what are you Going through?
I'm just -- I'm just going through life.
Well, what does that mean -- "i'm going through"?
I'm just going through life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.
But so -- don't just -- Just don't...
-every other word -- "don't." -...
Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap You see on the internet
Or how other people tell you Things are is --
It's not That big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.
Okay, it is a big deal If you do something wrong.
And not everybody Gets that.
Did you see -- you see those Pictures that are going around?
The kid from school Got drunk at the party?
-did you see that?
-yes.
Everybody saw those.
Yeah, everybody saw those.
Everybody saw That he's a dumbass,
And his life is ruined.
-he got drunk.
That's all.
-$55.54.
well, i don't know What he was doing,
But that's out there Forever, all right?
And once it's out there, There's not anything
Anybody can do about it, so -- So don't be him.
Well, i'm not him, Nor do i even know him.
So, i don't know why You have to assume
I'm gonna do Something wrong.
I don't.
I just...
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
You okay?
Why did you show those pictures To my mom?
She already knew About them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, i didn't tell her nothing, 'cause i don't know nothing.
You should have been straight With her, first off.
Why would i tell her Anything?
Because she's your mom.
And i'm supposed to be Your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me Anymore.
Look, i just don't want to talk About that.
Are you good?
I'm -- i just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know If you're good.
You can tell me that, Right?
Damn.
Anne:
They keep blaming taylor.
"does he have a problem With drinking?"
"does he have a problem With drugs?"
"oh, just -- just take him To see someone and go away."
How's taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage With you at all?
I got him To see a doctor.
But i-i-i think that scared him More than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush To deal with this.
Victims are allowed time To decide
If they want to pursue Their case.
Well, he waited To say anything,
And -- and they act Like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, And they -- they say,
You know, You're negligent.
There's a time, There's a window, for victims,
When they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, Consider it might be better
For taylor to wait Until he's ready.
So i should Just leave it alone?
You should make sure That what you're doing
Is having a positive effect On your son.
how are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling Overwhelmed,
If you feel stressed Or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, i'm not fine, But i'm okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Damn.
Eric.
That thing is sweet.
Yeah.
Wanna drive?
Serious?
Not gonna wreck it, Are you?
Hell no, man.
Beat the hell out of that bitch, But i ain't gonna wreck it.
All right, then.
Ow!
You're just A rough boy, huh?
You a rough boy, eric?
No.
Stop it!
Stop.
I don't like it like that, All right?
What do you like?
I just want to kiss.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about Last saturday night - the party?
-yeah.
The school's already been In contact with the department.
They gave us a summary Of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking That night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something In his drink.
Something what?
Ghb?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they Want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just Because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want --
I don't -- that's -- That's -- that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need To find out.
You really want to do this To your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category Of crime.
Forced intercourse with A member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They -- they were taking Pictures, there was drinking.
They -- they talked About him online.
You can't do something About that?
That's for the -- You can't do something With that?
That's for the school To handle.
-why?
It's a crime.
-look --
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot To put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, i'm not talking about Your son, i'm talking about...
Look, i've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's
Got a drinking problem Or something,
You should really try To get him some help.
Okay.
You go to these people Asking for help.
The minute you start talking, You can see it.
They don't believe you.
They -- they don't -- they won't Even call it what it is
Because they don't think It happens to boys.
Then i start Doubting myself.
Maybe i got it wrong.
S-so i go online, And i find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, Boys getting assaulted.
It happens More than you think.
I mean, that -- that school Wants to hide it.
The police Want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people To care about my son.
I'm gonna take Some notes.
Tell me what you know,
And if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing i ask -- Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use His name.
But this article Comes out,
It's not gonna be hard For people to do the math.
They're gonna know Where it's coming from.
So, Before you say anything,
Are you sure You want to go public with this?
Yes.
I am.
Six years ago, The leyland school was blessed
With the arrival Of dan sullivan.

I think Someone did something to me.
A student is claiming To have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know That's a lie.
Don't think your kids Are above mistakes.
You need To talk to your players.
What are you doing About what happened to him?
We've taken Disciplinary action
Appropriate To the circumstance -- What are you doing To those boys?

The suspension is fair.
As bad as it may seem, It can get worse.

He was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son To the hospital,
Get a rape kit done.
Is your son here?
Yes.
Maybe he should come out And talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, We need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk About it.
Look, if he's not going to Help us, we can't help him.
We have so many schools That are struggling right now,
That are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed To represent the city.
Represent all of us.
Not them!
All right, that school
Is nothing but a bunch of rich, Spoiled kids.
It's a -- It's a segregation academy.
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying To make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make This school bigger?
The hell That they should get to do that!
They're all -- well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it.
May i take the opportunity
To distance myself From the remark?
Stand there and say The first stupid thing
That falls Out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space For public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, Comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry Because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen Than antagonize.
Well, leslie, you are supposed To be the voice of the school,
And i see you just -- Just sit there and take it.
Let's focus on us, Focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event Coming up --
A remarkable evening that --
So we just sat Through a train wreck,
And you want to put on a dress And have a night out?
You have some curious Priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
Before we adjourn, I need to make the board
Aware of something That may or may not be an issue,
But it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made Against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, For everyone's sake,
It's important To maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I --
Legal's been made aware.
Dan sullivan's Questioned his players,
So all we can do Is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure You're all informed.
Any other business?
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
-take care.
Thank you.
-good to see you.
-take care.
-you too.
-i'll see you next week.
-bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, i need you To type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding This allegation
That, on the record, We say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned By the school,
But there Is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do The right thing.
We need to say The right thing.
You keep repeating that -- "say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure And there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, We're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite Of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support Promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball Team, we can't af--
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals For what we do know,
But we can't be accountable For what we don't know.
There's nothing more To do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want to go.
i know.
I don't want to talk To anybody.
It's -- it's just to make sure You're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act Like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not Just gonna go away.
Taylor, my name is nurse wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's Gonna be working with you today.
So, i want to talk with you About how this process works.
But do you have any questions, Just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, Please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else In the hospital,
We start with paperwork And end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you About medications, too.
We've got antibiotics For preventing
Sexually transmitted Infections.
And if that's something That you want to have,
We'll get that for you While you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple Of different reasons.
One of them Is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody Might have given you
Something to knock you out, It could test for that.
We also run a dna test
So that when everything Goes to the lab,
They can figure out What things belong to you
And what things Don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons Why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam Is talking.
You know, i will ask you To tell me what you remember
About what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me Figure out
What i need to be doing With the rest of the exam.
Why do you -- Why do you need to do that?
Why -- for what you do?
Why do you -- um...
Sorry.
Just, what -- why do you Need that information?
There's a couple Of different reasons.
One of them is because It really helps guide the exam.
If i know What you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for
And where i need to look For them.
The other reason Why we like to get a history
Is because it can go Into court.
If this ends up Going to court,
Then i can read your words To the jury,
And i think that can be A pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, If it's okay with you,
Is take a look At your anal-genital area
For same reasons -- Looking for any kind of injury
In that area and also Probably taking some swabs
In case there might be Any dna to be found there, too.
And that's kind of The long and short of it.
Any questions so far?
No.
Next, i'd like to take a look At your anal area.
So, again, i'm gonna touch On right hip,
And come in Towards the middle,
And just kind of Straighten out
Wrinkles in your skin Right here.
And doing -- Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up At the top area.
Okay, so, Hand back on right hip And moving in Towards center,
And fingers Right in the middle,
And you'll feel a swab Right between my fingers.
drink this.
Hey, anne, Why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to Follow up with h.I.V. Testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think That could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of Situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor
That you all normally see For things, that's great.
If not, i want to make sure That you get connected
With the city clinic For those tests.
-okay?
-okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask About the clothes
That he was wearing that night And if he still has them.
Okay.
I-i think so.
Okay.
If y'all haven't Washed them yet,
Put them in a paper bag And just tape it closed.
We did do wash.
We did.
But i don't think They were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, Tape it closed,
And then give those To the detective.
Oh.
Can i just bring Them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go To the police.
I've already been To the police.
Did you talk to a responding Officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's Usually the person
Who comes out And just takes a statement.
Normally you'll follow up With a detective later.

Hey, uh, bad time?
Just end-of-the-day Housekeeping.
It's the kind of world We live in.
Hey, uh, this is for you.
You -- you said Some very nice things about me
At that fundraiser, And, uh, well, thank you.
Oh.
All deserved.
Wow.
How do you do this?
I know, i know.
You can't tell me your secrets.
Oh, you know, it's not magic.
It's just patience.
So, listen, dan, We have to talk.
The incident that happened With the team,
We need to close it out, And we need to do it
In a way that, If it comes to it,
People understand We took it seriously.
Okay.
You need to discipline One of your players.
For what?
For what happened At that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there --
Have you seen The pictures
The kids Have been texting around?
Suspend the kids That are spreading that crap,
But don't take it out On the team.
The mother of the boy Has been in this office,
And she's been using Some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, You know,
So she's got to blame Somebody.
"rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that,
We have to look thoughtful And responsible.
People think this school Is about entitlement.
We have to promote The opposite.
If you make those kids Look guilty,
Then next thing, people are Saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned About their feelings.
No, this is not About their feelings.
If those boys want to go play Ball in college --
If they even want to go To college --
Even one game, That stays on their record.
You're talking About one player.
I'm talking About the team.
And when people come And they ask us
Why we didn't do anything About the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding What we're going to do,
Then we can do What has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game -- To prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation In a file
That says the player was sat For disciplinary reasons.
Who am i supposed to sit?
Well, it was The captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit kevin?
I don't think We want to get into things
With the lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric tanner.
Whatever you decide,
Just put it in writing For me, please.
Everybody know About this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing Anything to him?
Now we're -- we're looking At each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
Oh, hey, eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in On the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch Said something.
It's nothing.
Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything To you.
I know he's running His mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school Anymore.
He could still Pop off, kev.
You're the one running Your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up And let it be.
Like, let it go.
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, Nobody's speaking on it.
Y-- You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, All right?
And don't be a bitch About it.
Damn.
What's up?
Hey, yo, what up?
Lost?
Hey, st-- What?
Go roll up on your own.
Sean, no.
Back off.
You guys, st- hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, You got a problem?
Nah.
Then you need to figure out Where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight With these two?
Boys being boys?
Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging Out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
You're already late.
Let's not get Into an accident.
What you're doing Is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take Food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying To touch hhfk.
Okay, give kids A free breakfast -- yes.
But it needs to happen Before first period,
Not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families Of different means.
Getting their kids to school Before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed Is directly related
To how they perform in class.
Nobody's arguing about Providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about Is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking About feeding kids.
This is A civil rights issue.
What, is that -- Is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people In this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt Don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids Don't have rights?
We have a lot To cover tonight.
Does this even have anything To do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here To problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, Year in and out.
And we're not Talking about
If we should be teaching Singapore math
Or if the reading levels Are appropriate.
We are talking about what time To serve the kiddies food.
I have three degrees -- Two of them from i.U. --
And i feel like A fast-food manager
As much As a superintendent.
And monica --
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's A bleeding heart.
Hhfk -- good intentions, Poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something About it,
And you speaking to it, It means something.
I'm just trying to run My school.
our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, They just want to keep
Their mouths shut, Heads down,
Let the unions fight it out With the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working For students?
You need help With your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, My school needs help,
And you're talking About grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone To back you.
I need you to back me.
If i can win a few battles, Then i can fight some new ones.
Then we can all Start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying To get into this.
What's up?
what's up?
Nothing.
Uh, eric was talking about going To chicago this weekend --
You have something You want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something You want to tell me?
What is that?
A receipt?
For what?
Do i really need to sit here And punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought i didn't check Your credit-card receipts,
Or you thought I would be okay with you
-spending this kind of money?
-hey, she's my -- she's my girl.
How long have you been Seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was Gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her A slick bracelet,
And because you were So slick,
She got back with you And it was all good?
Are you having sexual relations With her?
Mom, please don't say it Like that.
Why --
Well, how do you Want me to say it?
Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
Getting busy?
Nobody says Any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's -- She's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, She could be.
That's how it's gonna be From now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there,
They're gonna be coming hard At you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be Your baby mama
Just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time val Was anywhere near $900 --
Do you think i'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here Are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am i Supposed to know?
Well, does her family Have any money?
Because if her family Has money,
Then she doesn't want Anything from you.
But these other girls, Running around here, broke,
Talking about, "i want me some rocks,
Show me the rocks," i...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those For the wts, 'cause you're better Than that.
You hear What i'm trying to say?
Yeah.
All right, now, You got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep A $900 bracelet.
But i gave it To her already.
What did you Buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, kevin, And you get it back today.
If not, i will go over there Myself with the police,
Because as far as i'm concerned, She stole it.
The avedon arts building?
The avedon library?
The avedon Athletic center?
I wasn't good at sports.
The avedon Computer science center?
We know you're good At computers.
Yeah.
Look, your school's not really A priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are All our children.
I don't need The fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going To a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity For you to start building
Your own legacy.
The name that goes On the building is yours,
Not your father's.
A million dollars For naming rights,
For the right to put your name Where it matters.
You know a good deal When you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch When i hear one, too.
Okay.
Let me think about it.

-i'll take care of these.
-okay.

I'm gonna go To that gala of yours.
Put me down For a couple of tickets.
Okay, i will.
Son of a bitch.
He talked to me Like i was 8 years old.
"i went to public school."
The only reason He went to public school
Is 'cause his dad Was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician Whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care About come from means,
You're not supposed to care About them.
I mean, even someone with money Thinks that.
I just -- ugh --
Getting sick Of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really Your career advice?
Is being headmaster Really your career?
Capital development Is my profession.
But it's not your school, So what do you care if --
Well, i could say It's not your company,
So what do you care,
Except you have A long-term contract.
If people at that place Aren't interested enough To put money into it --
"that place"?
This...
Is not a good topic For me.
Never is.
I care about what i do.
What i do is important.
Okay.
Here's the good news.
The goal is in sight.
Then i can learn To like new york
And join you at your nameless, Faceless, godless institution.

We should throw her A surprise party.
She doesn't like surprises.
I like surprises, So we should do it.
It is a big birthday For your mom.
I don't know if it's the one We should be experimenting on.
Hey, um...
So, your mom, she wanted me To have a talk with you.
And, you know, Just, uh --
You know, Just be mindful of guys.

You know, Guys are gonna be coming at you,
And, you know, You need to be...
You need to be smart.

No, like -- like don't do Anything like it at all.
Well, it's kind of late For that.
To be talking about it.
I've seen porn.
That's where you think You learned about sex?
Well, you didn't Talk about it.
Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think You know from a website.
No, i got it from people Who know what i'm going through,
People my age.
Well, what are you Going through?
Well, what are you Going through?
I'm just -- I'm just going through life.
Well, what does that mean -- "i'm going through"?
I'm just going through life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.
But so -- don't just -- Just don't...
-every other word -- "don't." -...
Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap You see on the internet
Or how other people tell you Things are is --
It's not That big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.
Okay, it is a big deal If you do something wrong.
And not everybody Gets that.
Did you see -- you see those Pictures that are going around?
The kid from school Got drunk at the party?
-did you see that?
-yes.
Everybody saw those.
Yeah, everybody saw those.
Everybody saw That he's a dumbass,
And his life is ruined.
-he got drunk.
That's all.
-$55.54.
well, i don't know What he was doing,
But that's out there Forever, all right?
And once it's out there, There's not anything
Anybody can do about it, so -- So don't be him.
Well, i'm not him, Nor do i even know him.
So, i don't know why You have to assume
I'm gonna do Something wrong.
I don't.
I just...
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
You okay?
Why did you show those pictures To my mom?
She already knew About them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, i didn't tell her nothing, 'cause i don't know nothing.
You should have been straight With her, first off.
Why would i tell her Anything?
Because she's your mom.
And i'm supposed to be Your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me Anymore.
Look, i just don't want to talk About that.
Are you good?
I'm -- i just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know If you're good.
You can tell me that, Right?
Damn.
Anne:
They keep blaming taylor.
"does he have a problem With drinking?"
"does he have a problem With drugs?"
"oh, just -- just take him To see someone and go away."
How's taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage With you at all?
I got him To see a doctor.
But i-i-i think that scared him More than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush To deal with this.
Victims are allowed time To decide
If they want to pursue Their case.
Well, he waited To say anything,
And -- and they act Like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, And they -- they say,
You know, You're negligent.
There's a time, There's a window, for victims,
When they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, Consider it might be better
For taylor to wait Until he's ready.
So i should Just leave it alone?
You should make sure That what you're doing
Is having a positive effect On your son.
how are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling Overwhelmed,
If you feel stressed Or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, i'm not fine, But i'm okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Damn.
Eric.
That thing is sweet.
Yeah.
Wanna drive?
Serious?
Not gonna wreck it, Are you?
Hell no, man.
Beat the hell out of that bitch, But i ain't gonna wreck it.
All right, then.
Ow!
You're just A rough boy, huh?
You a rough boy, eric?
No.
Stop it!
Stop.
I don't like it like that, All right?
What do you like?
I just want to kiss.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about Last saturday night - the party?
-yeah.
The school's already been In contact with the department.
They gave us a summary Of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking That night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something In his drink.
Something what?
Ghb?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they Want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just Because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want --
I don't -- that's -- That's -- that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need To find out.
You really want to do this To your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category Of crime.
Forced intercourse with A member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They -- they were taking Pictures, there was drinking.
They -- they talked About him online.
You can't do something About that?
That's for the -- You can't do something With that?
That's for the school To handle.
-why?
It's a crime.
-look --
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot To put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, i'm not talking about Your son, i'm talking about...
Look, i've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's
Got a drinking problem Or something,
You should really try To get him some help.
Okay.
You go to these people Asking for help.
The minute you start talking, You can see it.
They don't believe you.
They -- they don't -- they won't Even call it what it is
Because they don't think It happens to boys.
Then i start Doubting myself.
Maybe i got it wrong.
S-so i go online, And i find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, Boys getting assaulted.
It happens More than you think.
I mean, that -- that school Wants to hide it.
The police Want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people To care about my son.
I'm gonna take Some notes.
Tell me what you know,
And if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing i ask -- Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use His name.
But this article Comes out,
It's not gonna be hard For people to do the math.
They're gonna know Where it's coming from.
So, Before you say anything,
Are you sure You want to go public with this?
Yes.
I am.
Six years ago, The leyland school was blessed

A student is claiming To have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know That's a lie.
Don't think your kids Are above mistakes.
You need To talk to your players.
What are you doing About what happened to him?

He was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son To the hospital,
Get a rape kit done.
Is your son here?

Maybe he should come out And talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, We need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk About it.
Look, if he's not going to Help us, we can't help him.
We have so many schools That are struggling right now,
That are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed To represent the city.
Represent all of us.
Not them!
All right, that school
Is nothing but a bunch of rich, Spoiled kids.
It's a -- It's a segregation academy.
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying To make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make This school bigger?
The hell That they should get to do that!
They're all -- well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it.
May i take the opportunity
To distance myself From the remark?
Stand there and say The first stupid thing
That falls Out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space For public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, Comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry Because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen Than antagonize.
Well, leslie, you are supposed To be the voice of the school,
And i see you just -- Just sit there and take it.
Let's focus on us, Focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event Coming up --
A remarkable evening that --
So we just sat Through a train wreck,
And you want to put on a dress And have a night out?
You have some curious Priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
Before we adjourn, I need to make the board
Aware of something That may or may not be an issue,
But it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made Against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, For everyone's sake,
It's important To maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I --
Legal's been made aware.
Dan sullivan's Questioned his players,
So all we can do Is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure You're all informed.
Any other business?
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
-take care.
Thank you.
-good to see you.
-take care.
-you too.
-i'll see you next week.
-bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, i need you To type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding This allegation
That, on the record, We say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned By the school,
But there Is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do The right thing.
We need to say The right thing.
You keep repeating that -- "say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure And there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, We're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite Of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support Promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball Team, we can't af--
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals For what we do know,
But we can't be accountable For what we don't know.
There's nothing more To do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
Taylor:
I don't want to go.
Anne: i know.
I don't want to talk To anybody.
It's -- it's just to make sure You're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act Like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not Just gonna go away.
Nurse wells:
Taylor, my name is nurse wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's Gonna be working with you today.
So, i want to talk with you About how this process works.
But do you have any questions, Just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, Please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else In the hospital,
We start with paperwork And end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you About medications, too.
We've got antibiotics For preventing
Sexually transmitted Infections.
And if that's something That you want to have,
We'll get that for you While you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple Of different reasons.
One of them Is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody Might have given you
Something to knock you out, It could test for that.
We also run a dna test
So that when everything Goes to the lab,
They can figure out What things belong to you
And what things Don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons Why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam Is talking.
You know, i will ask you To tell me what you remember
About what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me Figure out
What i need to be doing With the rest of the exam.
Why do you -- Why do you need to do that?
Why -- for what you do?
Why do you -- um...
Sorry.
Just, what -- why do you Need that information?
There's a couple Of different reasons.
One of them is because It really helps guide the exam.
If i know What you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for
And where i need to look For them.
The other reason Why we like to get a history
Is because it can go Into court.
If this ends up Going to court,
Then i can read your words To the jury,
And i think that can be A pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, If it's okay with you,
Is take a look At your anal-genital area
For same reasons -- Looking for any kind of injury
In that area and also Probably taking some swabs
In case there might be Any dna to be found there, too.
And that's kind of The long and short of it.
Any questions so far?
No.
Next, i'd like to take a look At your anal area.
So, again, i'm gonna touch On right hip,
And come in Towards the middle,
And just kind of Straighten out
Wrinkles in your skin Right here.
And doing -- Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up At the top area.
Okay, so, Hand back on right hip And moving in Towards center,
And fingers Right in the middle,
And you'll feel a swab Right between my fingers.
drink this.
Hey, anne, Why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to Follow up with h.I.V. Testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think That could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of Situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor
That you all normally see For things, that's great.
If not, i want to make sure That you get connected
With the city clinic For those tests.
-okay?
-okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask About the clothes
That he was wearing that night And if he still has them.
Okay.
I-i think so.
Okay.
If y'all haven't Washed them yet,
Put them in a paper bag And just tape it closed.
We did do wash.
We did.
But i don't think They were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, Tape it closed,
And then give those To the detective.
Oh.
Can i just bring Them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go To the police.
I've already been To the police.
Did you talk to a responding Officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's Usually the person
Who comes out And just takes a statement.
Normally you'll follow up With a detective later.
How many people Do i have to talk to?
It's a lot.
Man: what, you didn't see me?
You didn't see me, huh?
Your dumb ass Didn't see me?
You need to learn to drive, Bitch.

I'm not trying to go around Smelling like a bitch.
Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
You think you got All the answers, don't you?
Oh.
Ah!
And the rebound.
Hey, uh, bad time?
Just end-of-the-day Housekeeping.
It's the kind of world We live in.
Hey, uh, this is for you.
You -- you said Some very nice things about me
At that fundraiser, And, uh, well, thank you.
Oh.
All deserved.
Wow.
How do you do this?
I know, i know.
You can't tell me your secrets.
Oh, you know, it's not magic.
It's just patience.
So, listen, dan, We have to talk.
The incident that happened With the team,
We need to close it out, And we need to do it
In a way that, If it comes to it,
People understand We took it seriously.
Okay.
You need to discipline One of your players.
For what?
For what happened At that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there --
Have you seen The pictures
The kids Have been texting around?
Suspend the kids That are spreading that crap,
But don't take it out On the team.
The mother of the boy Has been in this office,
And she's been using Some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, You know,
So she's got to blame Somebody.
"rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that,
We have to look thoughtful And responsible.
People think this school Is about entitlement.
We have to promote The opposite.
If you make those kids Look guilty,
Then next thing, people are Saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned About their feelings.
No, this is not About their feelings.
If those boys want to go play Ball in college --
If they even want to go To college --
Even one game, That stays on their record.
You're talking About one player.
I'm talking About the team.
And when people come And they ask us
Why we didn't do anything About the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding What we're going to do,
Then we can do What has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game -- To prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation In a file
That says the player was sat For disciplinary reasons.
Who am i supposed to sit?
Well, it was The captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit kevin?
I don't think We want to get into things
With the lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric tanner.
Whatever you decide,
Just put it in writing For me, please.
Everybody know About this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing Anything to him?
Now we're -- we're looking At each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
Oh, hey, eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in On the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch Said something.
It's nothing.
Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything To you.
I know he's running His mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school Anymore.
He could still Pop off, kev.
You're the one running Your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up And let it be.
Like, let it go.
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, Nobody's speaking on it.
Y-- You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, All right?
And don't be a bitch About it.
Damn.
I don't know.
One of those...
Come on, girl.
What's up?
Hey, yo, what up?
Lost?
Hey, st-- What?
Go roll up on your own.
Sean, no.
Back off.
You guys, st-- Chris: hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, You got a problem?
Nah.
Then you need to figure out Where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight With these two?
Boys being boys?
Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging Out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
You're already late.
Let's not get Into an accident.
What you're doing Is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take Food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying To touch hhfk.
Okay, give kids A free breakfast -- yes.
But it needs to happen Before first period,
Not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families Of different means.
Getting their kids to school Before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed Is directly related
To how they perform in class.
Nobody's arguing about Providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about Is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking About feeding kids.
This is A civil rights issue.
What, is that -- Is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people In this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt Don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids Don't have rights?
We have a lot To cover tonight.
Does this even have anything To do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here To problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, Year in and out.
And we're not Talking about
If we should be teaching Singapore math
Or if the reading levels Are appropriate.
We are talking about what time To serve the kiddies food.
I have three degrees -- Two of them from i.U. --
And i feel like A fast-food manager
As much As a superintendent.
And monica --
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's A bleeding heart.
Hhfk -- good intentions, Poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something About it,
And you speaking to it, It means something.
I'm just trying to run My school.
our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, They just want to keep
Their mouths shut, Heads down,
Let the unions fight it out With the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working For students?
You need help With your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, My school needs help,
And you're talking About grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone To back you.
I need you to back me.
If i can win a few battles, Then i can fight some new ones.
Then we can all Start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying To get into this.
What's up?
Terri: what's up?
Nothing.
Uh, eric was talking about going To chicago this weekend --
You have something You want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something You want to tell me?
What is that?
A receipt?
For what?
Do i really need to sit here And punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought i didn't check Your credit-card receipts,
Or you thought I would be okay with you
-spending this kind of money?
-hey, she's my -- she's my girl.
How long have you been Seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was Gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her A slick bracelet,
And because you were So slick,
She got back with you And it was all good?
Are you having sexual relations With her?
Mom, please don't say it Like that.
Why --
Well, how do you Want me to say it?
Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
Getting busy?
Nobody says Any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's -- She's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, She could be.
That's how it's gonna be From now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there,
They're gonna be coming hard At you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be Your baby mama
Just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time val Was anywhere near $900 --
Do you think i'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here Are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am i Supposed to know?
Well, does her family Have any money?
Because if her family Has money,
Then she doesn't want Anything from you.
But these other girls, Running around here, broke,
Talking about, "i want me some rocks,
Show me the rocks," i...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those For the wts, 'cause you're better Than that.
You hear What i'm trying to say?
Yeah.
All right, now, You got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep A $900 bracelet.
But i gave it To her already.
What did you Buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, kevin, And you get it back today.
If not, i will go over there Myself with the police,
Because as far as i'm concerned, She stole it.
The avedon arts building?
The avedon library?
The avedon [clears throat] Athletic center?
I wasn't good at sports.
The avedon Computer science center?
We know you're good At computers.
Yeah.
Look, your school's not really A priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are All our children.
I don't need The fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going To a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity For you to start building
Your own legacy.
The name that goes On the building is yours,
Not your father's.
A million dollars For naming rights,
For the right to put your name Where it matters.
You know a good deal When you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch When i hear one, too.

Okay, i will.
Son of a bitch.
He talked to me Like i was 8 years old.
"i went to public school."
The only reason He went to public school
Is 'cause his dad Was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician Whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care About come from means,
You're not supposed to care About them.
I mean, even someone with money Thinks that.
I just -- ugh --
Getting sick Of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really Your career advice?
Is being headmaster Really your career?
Capital development Is my profession.
But it's not your school, So what do you care if --
Well, i could say It's not your company,
So what do you care,
Except you have A long-term contract.
If people at that place Aren't interested enough To put money into it --
"that place"?
This...
Is not a good topic For me.
Never is.
I care about what i do.
What i do is important.
Okay.

-every other word -- "don't." -...
Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap You see on the internet
Or how other people tell you Things are is --
It's not That big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.

-$55.54.
Dan: well, i don't know What he was doing,

And once it's out there, There's not anything
Anybody can do about it, so -- So don't be him.

I'm gonna do Something wrong.
I don't.
I just...

Why did you show those pictures To my mom?
She already knew About them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, i didn't tell her nothing, 'cause i don't know nothing.
You should have been straight With her, first off.
Why would i tell her Anything?
Because she's your mom.
And i'm supposed to be Your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me Anymore.
Look, i just don't want to talk About that.
Are you good?
I'm -- i just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know If you're good.
You can tell me that, Right?
Damn.
Anne:
They keep blaming taylor.
"does he have a problem With drinking?"
"does he have a problem With drugs?"
"oh, just -- just take him To see someone and go away."
How's taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage With you at all?
I got him To see a doctor.
But i-i-i think that scared him More than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush To deal with this.
Victims are allowed time To decide
If they want to pursue Their case.
Well, he waited To say anything,
And -- and they act Like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, And they -- they say,
You know, You're negligent.
There's a time, There's a window, for victims,
When they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, Consider it might be better
For taylor to wait Until he's ready.
So i should Just leave it alone?
You should make sure That what you're doing
Is having a positive effect On your son.
how are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling Overwhelmed,
If you feel stressed Or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, i'm not fine, But i'm okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Damn.
Eric.
That thing is sweet.
Yeah.
Wanna drive?
Serious?
Not gonna wreck it, Are you?
Hell no, man.
Beat the hell out of that bitch, But i ain't gonna wreck it.
All right, then.
Ow!
You're just A rough boy, huh?
You a rough boy, eric?
No.
Stop it!
Stop.
I don't like it like that, All right?
What do you like?
I just want to kiss.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about Last saturday night - the party?
-yeah.
The school's already been In contact with the department.
They gave us a summary Of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking That night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something In his drink.
Something what?
Ghb?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they Want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just Because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want --
I don't -- that's -- That's -- that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need To find out.
You really want to do this To your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category Of crime.
Forced intercourse with A member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They -- they were taking Pictures, there was drinking.
They -- they talked About him online.
You can't do something About that?
That's for the -- You can't do something With that?
That's for the school To handle.
-why?
It's a crime.
-look --
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot To put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, i'm not talking about Your son, i'm talking about...
Look, i've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's
Got a drinking problem Or something,
You should really try To get him some help.
Okay.
You go to these people Asking for help.
The minute you start talking, You can see it.
They don't believe you.
They -- they don't -- they won't Even call it what it is
Because they don't think It happens to boys.
Then i start Doubting myself.
Maybe i got it wrong.
S-so i go online, And i find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, Boys getting assaulted.
It happens More than you think.
I mean, that -- that school Wants to hide it.
The police Want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people To care about my son.
I'm gonna take Some notes.
Tell me what you know,
And if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing i ask -- Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use His name.
But this article Comes out,
It's not gonna be hard For people to do the math.
They're gonna know Where it's coming from.
So, Before you say anything,
Are you sure You want to go public with this?
Yes.
I am.

Woman:
WE HAVE SO MANY SCHOOLS THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW,
THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED!
AND WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO?
GIVE THEM MORE BREAKS?
CUT THEIR PROPERTY TAXES?
YOU ALL ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE CITY.
REPRESENT ALL OF US.
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
NOT THEM!
ALL RIGHT, THAT SCHOOL
IS NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF RICH, SPOILED KIDS.
IT'S A -- IT'S A SEGREGATION ACADEMY.
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT BIGGER?
I MEAN, THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS SCHOOL BIGGER?
[ SCOFFS ] THE HELL THAT THEY SHOULD GET TO DO THAT!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THEY'RE ALL -
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA SAY IDIOTS...
YOU JUST SAID IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAY I TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM THE REMARK?
STAND THERE AND SAY THE FIRST STUPID THING
THAT FALLS OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS.
GOD!
IT IS A SPACE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
WHERE WAS THE COMMENT?
IF THEY WANT TO COMMENT, COMMENT.
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
IT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.
THEY'RE ANGRY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE ANGRY.
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO LISTEN THAN ANTAGONIZE.
WELL, LESLIE, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE VOICE OF THE SCHOOL,
AND I SEE YOU JUST -- JUST SIT THERE AND TAKE IT.
[ CHUCKLES ] LET'S FOCUS ON US, FOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE DOING.
WE HAVE AN AMAZING EVENT COMING UP --
A REMARKABLE EVENING THAT --
SO WE JUST SAT THROUGH A TRAIN WRECK,
AND YOU WANT TO PUT ON A DRESS AND HAVE A NIGHT OUT?
YOU HAVE SOME CURIOUS PRIORITIES.
THAT NIGHT OUT IS GOING TO RAISE $3 MILLION IN ONE EVENING.
THAT'S MY PRIORITY.
BEFORE WE ADJOURN, I NEED TO MAKE THE BOARD
AWARE OF SOMETHING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE,
BUT IT SHOULD BE A CONCERN.
THERE WAS AN ALLEGATION MADE AGAINST SOME OF OUR STUDENTS.
ABOUT WHAT?
NOTHING'S BEEN SUBSTANTIATED.
AT THIS POINT, FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN ANONYMITY.
HOLD ON.
I --
LEGAL'S BEEN MADE AWARE.
DAN SULLIVAN'S QUESTIONED HIS PLAYERS,
SO ALL WE CAN DO IS BE DILIGENT.
BEYOND THAT, WE'LL MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALL INFORMED.
ANY OTHER BUSINESS?
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE ADJOURNED.
THANK YOU ALL.
IT'S A GOOD DAY'S WORK.
-TAKE CARE.
THANK YOU.
-GOOD TO SEE YOU.
-TAKE CARE.
-YOU TOO.
-I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
-BYE-BYE.
YOU NEED ME TO STAY?
UH, NO, I NEED YOU TO TYPE THAT STUFF UP FOR ME.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT REGARDING THIS ALLEGATION
THAT, ON THE RECORD, WE SAY THE RIGHT THINGS.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, LESLIE?
IT WAS OFF CAMPUS.
THE EVENT WASN'T SANCTIONED BY THE SCHOOL,
BUT THERE IS SOME LIABILITY.
IT COULD GET VERY UGLY.
SO WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
WE NEED TO SAY THE RIGHT THING.
YOU KEEP REPEATING THAT -- "SAY THE RIGHT THING."
THERE'S THE FACT PROCEDURE AND THERE'S THE RUMOR PROCEDURE.
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE DEALING WITH RUMOR.
DON'T PUBLICIZE THE RUMOR.
PROMOTE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE RUMOR SAYS.
PROVIDE PROOF TO SUPPORT PROMOTION OF THE OPPOSITE.
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED, LESLIE?
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE BASKETBALL TEAM, WE CAN'T AF--
DAN TALKED TO THE TEAM.
NO ONE'S ADMITTED ANYTHING.
WE CAN DISCIPLINE INDIVIDUALS FOR WHAT WE DO KNOW,
BUT WE CAN'T BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO RIGHT NOW.
OKAY.
OKAY.
[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]
Taylor:
I DON'T WANT TO GO.
Anne:
I KNOW.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY.
IT'S -
- IT'S JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY, OKAY?
I JUST WANT IT TO GO AWAY.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.
THEY WANT TO ACT LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.
IT'LL GET BETTER.
I PROMISE.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST GONNA GO AWAY.
Nurse Wells:
TAYLOR, MY NAME IS NURSE WELLS.
I'M THE FORENSIC NURSE THAT'S GONNA BE WORKING WITH YOU TODAY.
SO, I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS.
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, JUST OFF THE TOP?
NO.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
IF ANYTHING COMES UP, PLEASE LET ME KNOW, ALL RIGHT?
SO, THIS IS HOW THIS ALL GOES.
WE START AND END WITH PAPERWORK.
AS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HOSPITAL,
WE START WITH PAPERWORK AND END WITH PAPERWORK.
I'LL TALK WITH YOU ABOUT MEDICATIONS, TOO.
WE'VE GOT ANTIBIOTICS FOR PREVENTING
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS.
AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE,
WE'LL GET THAT FOR YOU WHILE YOU'RE HERE.
OKAY?
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU, I'LL DRAW SOME BLOOD, TOO.
AND WE DO THAT FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT REASONS.
ONE OF THEM IS FOR A TOXICOLOGY SCREEN.
LIKE, IF SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE GIVEN YOU
SOMETHING TO KNOCK YOU OUT, IT COULD TEST FOR THAT.
WE ALSO RUN A DNA TEST
SO THAT WHEN EVERYTHING GOES TO THE LAB,
THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THINGS BELONG TO YOU
AND WHAT THINGS DON'T BELONG TO YOU.
THOSE ARE THE TWO REASONS WHY WE DO THAT.
MOST OF THE REST OF THE EXAM IS TALKING.
YOU KNOW, I WILL ASK YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
I'M GONNA WRITE IT DOWN.
IT KIND OF HELPS ME FIGURE OUT
WHAT I NEED TO BE DOING WITH THE REST OF THE EXAM.
WHY DO YOU -- WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO THAT?
WHY -
- FOR WHAT YOU DO?
WHY DO YOU -
- UM...
SORRY.
JUST, WHAT -
- WHY DO YOU NEED THAT INFORMATION?
THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT REASONS.
ONE OF THEM IS BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPS GUIDE THE EXAM.
IF I KNOW WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED,
I KNOW WHAT THINGS I NEED TO LOOK FOR
AND WHERE I NEED TO LOOK FOR THEM.
THE OTHER REASON WHY WE LIKE TO GET A HISTORY
IS BECAUSE IT CAN GO INTO COURT.
IF THIS ENDS UP GOING TO COURT,
THEN I CAN READ YOUR WORDS TO THE JURY,
AND I THINK THAT CAN BE A PRETTY POWERFUL THING.
THE LAST THING WE'LL DO, IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
IS TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ANAL-GENITAL AREA
FOR SAME REASONS -- LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF INJURY
IN THAT AREA AND ALSO PROBABLY TAKING SOME SWABS
IN CASE THERE MIGHT BE ANY DNA TO BE FOUND THERE, TOO.
AND THAT'S KIND OF THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT.
ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?
NO.
NEXT, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ANAL AREA.
SO, AGAIN, I'M GONNA TOUCH ON RIGHT HIP,
AND COME IN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE,
AND JUST KIND OF STRAIGHTEN OUT
WRINKLES IN YOUR SKIN RIGHT HERE.
AND DOING -- LOOKING AT THE LOWER AREA.
AND THEN LOOKING UP AT THE TOP AREA.
[ Voice fading ] OKAY, SO, HAND BACK ON RIGHT HIP...
[ BREATHING HEAVILY ] ...AND MOVING IN TOWARDS CENTER,
AND FINGERS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,
AND YOU'LL FEEL A SWAB RIGHT BETWEEN MY FINGERS.

HEY, ANNE, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS TO FOLLOW UP WITH H.I.V. TESTING.
H.I.V.?
YEAH.
I DIDN'T EVEN...
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT COULD...
YEAH, AND OF COURSE NOT.
WHY WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
BUT IN THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS, IT'S RECOMMENDED.
SO, IF YOU HAVE A DOCTOR
THAT YOU ALL NORMALLY SEE FOR THINGS, THAT'S GREAT.
IF NOT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET CONNECTED
WITH THE CITY CLINIC FOR THOSE TESTS.
-OKAY?
-OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE CLOTHES
THAT HE WAS WEARING THAT NIGHT AND IF HE STILL HAS THEM.
OKAY.
I-I THINK SO.
OKAY.
IF Y'ALL HAVEN'T WASHED THEM YET,
PUT THEM IN A PAPER BAG AND JUST TAPE IT CLOSED.
[ SIGHS ] WE DID DO WASH.
WE DID.
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE IN THERE.
NO.
OKAY.
PUT THEM IN A PAPER BAG, TAPE IT CLOSED,
AND THEN GIVE THOSE TO THE DETECTIVE.
OH.
CAN I JUST BRING THEM TO YOU?
NO.
EVIDENCE NEEDS TO GO TO THE POLICE.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN TO THE POLICE.
DID YOU TALK TO A RESPONDING OFFICER OR A DETECTIVE?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
SO, A RESPONDING OFFICER'S USUALLY THE PERSON
WHO COMES OUT AND JUST TAKES A STATEMENT.

I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOUR SECRETS.
[ CHUCKLES ] OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT MAGIC.
IT'S JUST PATIENCE.
SO, LISTEN, DAN, WE HAVE TO TALK.
THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED WITH THE TEAM,
WE NEED TO CLOSE IT OUT, AND WE NEED TO DO IT
IN A WAY THAT, IF IT COMES TO IT,
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.
OKAY.
YOU NEED TO DISCIPLINE ONE OF YOUR PLAYERS.
FOR WHAT?
FOR WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT PARTY.
I TALKED TO MY BOYS.
NOTHING HAPPENED.
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
THERE WAS DRINKING, THERE --
HAVE YOU SEEN THE PICTURES
THE KIDS HAVE BEEN TEXTING AROUND?
SUSPEND THE KIDS THAT ARE SPREADING THAT CRAP,
BUT DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON THE TEAM.
THE MOTHER OF THE BOY HAS BEEN IN THIS OFFICE,
AND SHE'S BEEN USING SOME UGLY LANGUAGE.
WELL, HER KID GOT WASTED DRUNK, YOU KNOW,
SO SHE'S GOT TO BLAME SOMEBODY.
"RAPE." THAT'S THE WORD SHE USED.
THAT'S INSANE.
AND COMPARED TO THAT,
WE HAVE TO LOOK THOUGHTFUL AND RESPONSIBLE.
PEOPLE THINK THIS SCHOOL IS ABOUT ENTITLEMENT.
WE HAVE TO PROMOTE THE OPPOSITE.
IF YOU MAKE THOSE KIDS LOOK GUILTY,
THEN NEXT THING, PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY'RE GUILTY.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS.
NO, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS.
IF THOSE BOYS WANT TO GO PLAY BALL IN COLLEGE --
IF THEY EVEN WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE --
EVEN ONE GAME, THAT STAYS ON THEIR RECORD.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE PLAYER.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TEAM.
AND WHEN PEOPLE COME AND THEY ASK US
WHY WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE TEAM, WE DID.
BUT IF WE'RE THE ONES DECIDING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO,
THEN WE CAN DO WHAT HAS THE LEAST IMPACT.
YOU'RE BEING REACTIONARY.
THIS IS A LITTLE ACT.
ONE PLAYER, ONE GAME -- TO PREVENT MORE HURT ELSEWHERE.
BUT THERE WILL BE A NOTATION IN A FILE
THAT SAYS THE PLAYER WAS SAT FOR DISCIPLINARY REASONS.
[ SIGHS ]
WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO SIT?
WELL, IT WAS THE CAPTAIN'S PARTY.
KEVIN?
YOU WANT ME TO SIT KEVIN?

HOW COME YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HIM?

- WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH PLAYER INDIVIDUALLY.

YOU'RE NOT COMING AT HIM.
SO HOW'S THAT FAIR?

- YES.
BUT IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE FIRST PERIOD,
NOT DURING FIRST PERIOD.
OH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES OF DIFFERENT MEANS.
GETTING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BEFORE CLASS ISN'T PRACTICAL.
GETTING KIDS FED IS DIRECTLY RELATED
TO HOW THEY PERFORM IN CLASS.
NOBODY'S ARGUING ABOUT PROVIDING A MEAL FOR THE KIDS.
A-ALL THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN IT HAPPENS.
WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT FEEDING KIDS.
THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.

WHAT, IS THAT -- IS THAT FUNNY TO YOU?
A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE?

THAT THE PEOPLE BEING HURT DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU?
OR THAT LITTLE BROWN KIDS DON'T HAVE RIGHTS?

DOES THIS EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR SCHOOL?
NOT MINE.

SO WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?

HMM, WELL, FOR $900, SHE COULD BE.
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE FROM NOW ON.
GOOD LOOKS, SKILLS.
YOU'VE GOT MONEY.
THERE ARE GIRLS OUT THERE,
THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING HARD AT YOU FOR THAT.
THEY'RE GONNA BE TRYING TO BE YOUR BABY MAMA
JUST SO THEY CAN GET PAID.
THAT'S HOW THEY ARE.
AND THE LAST TIME VAL WAS ANYWHERE NEAR $900 --
DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?
SOME OF THESE GIRLS OUT HERE ARE GONNA HOPE THAT YOU ARE.
THEN HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
WELL, DOES HER FAMILY HAVE ANY MONEY?
BECAUSE IF HER FAMILY HAS MONEY,
THEN SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU.
BUT THESE OTHER GIRLS, RUNNING AROUND HERE, BROKE,
TALKING ABOUT, "I WANT ME SOME ROCKS,
SHOW ME THE ROCKS," I...
THOSE ARE STRAIGHT HOS.
YOU CAN LEAVE THOSE FOR THE WTs,
'CAUSE YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY?

SHE DOESN'T GET TO KEEP A $900 BRACELET.
BUT I GAVE IT TO HER ALREADY.
WHAT DID YOU BUY IT WITH?

THAT'S $900.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

WHY DID YOU SHOW THOSE PICTURES TO MY MOM?
SHE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THEM.
SHE KEPT TEXTING ME.
SO?
LOOK, I DIDN'T TELL HER NOTHING, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT WITH HER, FIRST OFF.
WHY WOULD I TELL HER ANYTHING?
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR MOM.
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
YOU DON'T TALK TO HER.
YOU DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ANYMORE.
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
ARE YOU GOOD?
I'M -
- I JUST SAID I'M NOT TRYING TO...
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU CAN TELL ME THAT, RIGHT?
[ SIGHS ]
DAMN.
Anne:
THEY KEEP BLAMING TAYLOR.
"DOES HE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DRINKING?"
"DOES HE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DRUGS?"
"OH, JUST -
- JUST TAKE HIM TO SEE SOMEONE AND GO AWAY."
Esposito:
HOW'S TAYLOR DOING?
DEPRESSED?
HE'S JUST SAD.
DOES HE ENGAGE WITH YOU AT ALL?
I GOT HIM TO SEE A DOCTOR.
BUT I-I-I THINK THAT SCARED HIM MORE THAN HELPED HIM.
THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A RUSH TO DEAL WITH THIS.
VICTIMS ARE ALLOWED TIME TO DECIDE
IF THEY WANT TO PURSUE THEIR CASE.
WELL, HE WAITED TO SAY ANYTHING,
AND -
- AND THEY ACT LIKE IT'S HIS FAULT.
I WAITED TO TELL THE POLICE, AND THEY -
- THEY SAY,
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NEGLIGENT.
THERE'S A TIME, THERE'S A WINDOW, FOR VICTIMS,
WHEN THEY'RE READY TO TALK.
IT MIGHT...
I'M SAYING, CONSIDER IT MIGHT BE BETTER
FOR TAYLOR TO WAIT UNTIL HE'S READY.
SO I SHOULD JUST LEAVE IT ALONE?
YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS HAVING A POSITIVE EFFECT ON YOUR SON.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?
EH.
IF YOU START FEELING OVERWHELMED,
IF YOU FEEL STRESSED OR ANXIOUS...
YEAH, YEAH.
I KNOW THE SIGNS.
I'M FINE.
WELL, I'M NOT FINE, BUT I'M OKAY.
OKAY.
YEAH.
[ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ]
DAMN.
ERIC.
THAT THING IS SWEET.
YEAH.
WANNA DRIVE?
SERIOUS?
NOT GONNA WRECK IT, ARE YOU?
HELL NO, MAN.
BEAT THE HELL OUT OF THAT BITCH, BUT I AIN'T GONNA WRECK IT.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
[ TIRES SQUEALING ]
[ ENGINE REVVING ]
[ LAUGHS ]
OW!
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU'RE JUST A ROUGH BOY, HUH?
YOU A ROUGH BOY, ERIC?
NO.
[ BREATHING HEAVILY ]
STOP IT!
STOP.
I DON'T LIKE IT LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?
I JUST WANT TO KISS.
OKAY.
HEY, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
HEY.
HEY.
NAME?
MY NAME OR...?
YOUR SON'S?
TAYLOR BLAINE.
TAYLOR.
HOW OLD IS HE?
17.
AND THIS IS ABOUT LAST SATURDAY NIGHT --
-THE PARTY?
-YEAH.
THE SCHOOL'S ALREADY BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT.
THEY GAVE US A SUMMARY OF EVENTS, PICTURES.
THAT'S YOUR SON?
YES.
WAS HE DRINKING THAT NIGHT?
HE DID NOT GET DRUNK.
SOMEBODY PUT SOMETHING IN HIS DRINK.
SOMETHING WHAT?
GHB?
THEY DRUGGED HIM.
HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS THERE.
SHE SAW HIM.
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GIVE HIM DRUGS?
THEY DON'T LIKE HIM.
THAT'S A LOT OF EFFORT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEBODY.
WHY WOULD THEY WANT --
I DON'T -
- THAT'S -- THAT'S -
- THAT'S YOUR JOB.
THAT'S...
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO FIND OUT.
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS TO YOUR SON?
MY SON WAS RAPED.
THAT'S A SPECIFIC CATEGORY OF CRIME.
FORCED INTERCOURSE WITH A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL IT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL IT?
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT.
I JUST NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING.
THEY -
- THEY WERE TAKING PICTURES, THERE WAS DRINKING.
THEY -
- THEY TALKED ABOUT HIM ONLINE.
YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?
THAT'S FOR THE -- YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING WITH THAT?
THAT'S FOR THE SCHOOL TO HANDLE.
-WHY?
IT'S A CRIME.
-LOOK --
SOME OF THESE KIDS ARE MINORS.
YOUR SON IS A MINOR.
THIS IS A LOT TO PUT THEM THROUGH.
KIDS DO DUMB STUFF.
NOW, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR SON, I'M TALKING ABOUT...
LOOK, I'VE GOT A 15-YEAR-OLD.
I KNOW HOW IT IS.
I'D MAYBE...
IF YOU THINK YOUR SON'S
GOT A DRINKING PROBLEM OR SOMETHING,
YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY TO GET HIM SOME HELP.
OKAY.
[ DOOR CLOSES ]
YOU GO TO THESE PEOPLE ASKING FOR HELP.
[ Ringing ] THE MINUTE YOU START TALKING, YOU CAN SEE IT.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
THEY -
- THEY DON'T -
- THEY WON'T EVEN CALL IT WHAT IT IS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK IT HAPPENS TO BOYS.
THEN I START DOUBTING MYSELF.
MAYBE I GOT IT WRONG.
S-SO I GO ONLINE, AND I FIND ALL THESE ARTICLES.
SCHOOLS, SPORTS TEAMS, BOYS GETTING ASSAULTED.
IT HAPPENS MORE THAN YOU THINK.
I MEAN, THAT -
- THAT SCHOOL WANTS TO HIDE IT.
THE POLICE WANT TO IGNORE IT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BEG PEOPLE TO CARE ABOUT MY SON.
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME NOTES.
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW,
AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE, I'LL PURSUE IT.
THE ONLY THING I ASK -- CAN YOU NOT PRINT MY SON'S NAME?
I DON'T HAVE TO USE HIS NAME.
BUT THIS ARTICLE COMES OUT,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE HARD FOR PEOPLE TO DO THE MATH.
THEY'RE GONNA KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM.
SO, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO PUBLIC WITH THIS?
YES.
I AM.
__
Six years ago, the Leyland School was blessed with the arrival of Dan Sullivan.
Four winning seasons, a state championship...
Ms. Blaine, we're suspending Taylor from school.
There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code.
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.
He was really messed up.
We need to talk with Becca.
I do not want her at those parties.
Bitch looking good, huh?
D-damn.
Terri: $20,000 a year on that school.
You'd think he'd make better choices.
You know that girl is just...
Oh, I know you're not getting down on the sister.
Anne:
What were you doing?
!
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!
I had a couple of beers.
Then everything got messed up.
I think someone did something to me.
A student is claiming to have been assaulted.
By one of my players?
Well, you know that's a lie.
Don't think your kids are above mistakes.
You need to talk to your players.
- What are you doing about what happened to him?
- We've taken disciplinary action
- appropriate to the circumstance...
- What are you doing to those boys?
!
- Tell me what you're doing to the boys!
- The suspension is fair.
As bad as it may seem, it can get worse.
Man: 911.
What's your emergency?
I want to report a rape.
Roberts:
Ms. Blaine?
Yes.
Did you call 911?
When did the assault take place?
Last Saturday.
You know the location?
Uh, it was a party.
I'm not sure where.
Exact location's gonna be important to detectives, okay?
Victim's name?
Taylor.
Where's she now?
Taylor's my son.
The victim's a male?
Yes, my son.
And this is a sexual assault?
Yes.
Does your son know the assailant?
It was some other kids at the school.
One kid?
More than one?
He doesn't remember.
He doesn't remember?
Or he's not saying?
he was drugged.
He doesn't remember.
Gonna need to take your son to the hospital, get a rape kit done.
Sanders:
Is your son here?
Yes.
Maybe he should come out and talk to us.
He doesn't want to.
If he's the victim, we need to speak to him.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Look, if he's not going to help us, we can't help him.
[Sighs]
[Indistinct shouting, scattered applause]
Woman:
We have so many schools that are struggling right now, that are underfunded!
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?
Cut their property taxes?
You all are supposed to represent the city.
Represent all of us.
[Indistinct shouting]
Not them!
All right, that school is nothing but a bunch of rich, spoiled kids.
- It's a...
It's a segregation academy.
- [Indistinct shouting]
It's ridiculous.
And you're trying to make it bigger?
I mean, they're trying to make this school bigger?
[Scoffs] The hell that they should get to do that!
[Cheers and applause]
They're all... well, I'm not gonna say idiots...
You just said it. [Laughter]
May I take the opportunity to distance myself from the remark?
Stand there and say the first stupid thing that falls out of their mouths.
God!
It is a space for public comment.
Where was the comment?
If they want to comment, comment.
They have nothing to say.
It's part of the process.
They're angry because they want to be angry.
Sometimes it's better to listen than antagonize.
Well, Leslie, you are supposed to be the voice of the school, and I see you just...
Just sit there and take it.
[Chuckles] Let's focus on us, focus on what we're doing.
We have an amazing event coming up...
A remarkable evening that...
So we just sat through a train wreck, and you want to put on a dress and have a night out?
You have some curious priorities.
That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening.
That's my priority.
Before we adjourn, I need to make the board aware of something that may or may not be an issue, but it should be a concern.
There was an allegation made against some of our students.
About what?
Nothing's been substantiated.
At this point, for everyone's sake, it's important to maintain anonymity.
Hold on.
I...
Legal's been made aware.
Dan Sullivan's questioned his players, so all we can do is be diligent.
Beyond that, we'll make sure you're all informed.
Any other business?
That's it.
We're adjourned.
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.
- Take care.
Thank you.
- Good to see you.
- Take care.
- You too.
- I'll see you next week.
- Bye-bye.
You need me to stay?
Uh, no, I need you to type that stuff up for me.
It's very important regarding this allegation that, on the record, we say the right things.
What's the problem, Leslie?
It was off campus.
The event wasn't sanctioned by the school, but there is some liability.
It could get very ugly.
So we need to do the right thing.
We need to say the right thing.
You keep repeating that...
"Say the right thing."
There's the fact procedure and there's the rumor procedure.
Right now, we're dealing with rumor.
Don't publicize the rumor.
Promote the opposite of what the rumor says.
Provide proof to support promotion of the opposite.
What exactly happened, Leslie?
If this is about the basketball team, we can't af...
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.
We can discipline individuals for what we do know, but we can't be accountable for what we don't know.
There's nothing more to do right now.
Okay.
Okay.
[Door opens, closes]
- Taylor:
I don't want to go.
- Anne:
I know.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
It's... it's just to make sure you're okay, okay?
I just want it to go away.
That's what they want.
They want to act like it never happened.
It'll get better.
I promise.
But it's not just gonna go away.
Nurse Wells:
Taylor, my name is Nurse Wells.
I'm the forensic nurse that's gonna be working with you today.
So, I want to talk with you about how this process works.
But do you have any questions, just off the top?
No.
Okay.
All right.
If anything comes up, please let me know, all right?
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.
As like everything else in the hospital, we start with paperwork and end with paperwork.
I'll talk with you about medications, too.
We've got antibiotics for preventing sexually transmitted infections.
And if that's something that you want to have, we'll get that for you while you're here.
Okay?
If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too.
And we do that for a couple of different reasons.
One of them is for a toxicology screen.
Like, if somebody might have given you something to knock you out, it could test for that.
We also run a DNA test so that when everything goes to the lab, they can figure out what things belong to you and what things don't belong to you.
Those are the two reasons why we do that.
Most of the rest of the exam is talking.
You know, I will ask you to tell me what you remember about what was going on.
I'm gonna write it down.
It kind of helps me figure out what I need to be doing with the rest of the exam.
Why do you...
Why do you need to do that?
Why... for what you do?
Why do you... um...
Sorry.
Just, what... why do you need that information?
There's a couple of different reasons.
One of them is because it really helps guide the exam.
If I know what you experienced,
I know what things I need to look for and where I need to look for them.
The other reason why we like to get a history is because it can go into court.
If this ends up going to court, then I can read your words to the jury, and I think that can be a pretty powerful thing.
The last thing we'll do, if it's okay with you, is take a look at your anal-genital area for same reasons...
Looking for any kind of injury in that area and also probably taking some swabs in case there might be any DNA to be found there, too.
And that's kind of the long and short of it.
Any questions so far?
No.
Next, I'd like to take a look at your anal area.
So, again, I'm gonna touch on right hip, and come in towards the middle, and just kind of straighten out wrinkles in your skin right here.
And doing...
Looking at the lower area.
And then looking up at the top area.
- [Voice fading] Okay, so, hand back on right hip...
- [Breathing heavily]
And moving in towards center, and fingers right in the middle, and you'll feel a swab right between my fingers.
[ Laughter]
Drink this.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Nurse Wells:
Hey, Anne, why don't you come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's important for you guys to follow up with H.I.V. testing.
H.I.V.?
Yeah.
I didn't even...
I didn't even think that could...
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?
But in these kinds of situations, it's recommended.
So, if you have a doctor that you all normally see for things, that's great.
If not, I want to make sure that you get connected with the city clinic for those tests.
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them.
Okay.
I-I think so.
Okay.
If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed.
[Sighs] We did do wash.
We did.
But I don't think they were in there.
No.
Okay.
Put them in a paper bag, tape it closed, and then give those to the detective.
Oh.
Can I just bring them to you?
No.
Evidence needs to go to the police.
I've already been to the police.
Did you talk to a responding officer or a detective?
I don't even know.
So, a responding officer's usually the person
- who comes out and just takes a statement.
- [Sighs]
Normally you'll follow up with a detective later.
How many people do I have to talk to?
It's a lot.
[Turn signal clicking]
[Tires screech] [Gasps]
Man:
What, you didn't see me?
You didn't see me, huh?
Your dumb ass didn't see me?
You need to learn to drive, bitch.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Hey, you listening to me?
!
Learn to drive!
[Dial tone]
[Dialing]
[Ringing]
Ken:
Indianapolis police.
Detective Williams.
Ken?
It's Terri.
Terri, what's up?
How's Michael?
Good.
He's good.
Uh, listen, Ken, I got into an incident on my way in today.
You okay?
I'm fine.
It's just, the other driver, he was... aggressive.
White guy?
Black guy?
White, of course.
Just really aggressive.
And I got a photo of his license plate, and I was wondering if you could do anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Send it through.
If anything pops up, I'll, uh...
You know, we'll get into it.
Yeah?
You'll take care of it?
Hey, you know what, Terri?
For you...
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Thanks, Ken.

[School bell rings]
[Knock on door]
Hey, uh, bad time?
Just end-of-the-day housekeeping.
It's the kind of world we live in.
[Chuckles] Hey, uh, this is for you.
You... you said some very nice things about me at that fundraiser, and, uh, well, thank you.
Oh.
All deserved.
Wow.
How do you do this?
I know, I know.
You can't tell me your secrets.
[Chuckles] Oh, you know, it's not magic.
It's just patience.
So, listen, Dan, we have to talk.
The incident that happened with the team, we need to close it out, and we need to do it in a way that, if it comes to it, people understand we took it seriously.
Okay.
You need to discipline one of your players.
For what?
For what happened at that party.
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.
Something happened.
There was drinking, there...
Have you seen the pictures the kids have been texting around?
Suspend the kids that are spreading that crap, but don't take it out on the team.
The mother of the boy has been in this office, and she's been using some ugly language.
Well, her kid got wasted drunk, you know, so she's got to blame somebody.
"Rape." That's the word she used.
That's insane.
And compared to that, we have to look thoughtful and responsible.
People think this school is about entitlement.
We have to promote the opposite.
If you make those kids look guilty, then next thing, people are saying they're guilty.
I know.
You're concerned about their feelings.
No, this is not about their feelings.
If those boys want to go play ball in college...
If they even want to go to college...
Even one game, that stays on their record.
You're talking about one player.
I'm talking about the team.
And when people come and they ask us why we didn't do anything about the team, we did.
But if we're the ones deciding what we're going to do, then we can do what has the least impact.
You're being reactionary.
This is a little act.
One player, one game... to prevent more hurt elsewhere.
But there will be a notation in a file that says the player was sat for disciplinary reasons.
[Sighs]
Who am I supposed to sit?
Well, it was the captain's party.
Kevin?
You want me to sit Kevin?
I don't think we want to get into things with the Lacroix family.
Who's the other captain?
Eric Tanner.
Whatever you decide, just put it in writing for me, please.
[Indistinct shouting]
Everybody know about this?
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.
But people know.
It's one game.
And what about Kevin?
He's the other team captain.
How come you're not doing anything to him?
Now we're... we're looking at each player individually.
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.
So how's that fair?
One game.
All right?
[Door slams]
Oh, hey, Eric.
What's up, bro?
Want to get in on the game?
Eric.
Eric!
That little bitch said something.
- It's nothing.
- Well, it's nothing for you.
They're not doing anything to you.
I know he's running his mouth.
What's he gonna say?
He's not even in school anymore.
He could still pop off, Kev.
You're the one running your mouth, though, man.
You need to shut the hell up and let it be.
Like, let it go.
[Sighs]
I got you on this.
How you got me?
'Cause it's done.
That's it.
After this, nobody's speaking on it.
Y...
You just need to chill, man.
Do it for the team, all right?
And don't be a bitch about it.
Damn.
[School bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
I don't know.
One of those...
[Laughs]
Come on, girl.
What's up?
Hey, yo, what up?
Lost?
- Hey, St...
- What?
- Go roll up on your own.
- Sean, no.
Back off.
- You guys, St...
- Chris:
Hey.
Do me better.
Hey.
We got a problem?
Mateo, you got a problem?
Nah. [School bell rings]
Then you need to figure out where you need to be.
You have class?
Yeah.
Then get to class.
Let's go.
Everything straight with these two?
Boys being boys?
[Chuckles] Yeah.
I want you to be mindful hanging out between class, okay?
Yeah.
Get where you need to be.
Whoa.
You're already late.
Let's not get into an accident.
Monica:
What you're doing is wrong, and it's cruel.
You're literally trying to take food out of children's mouths.
Nobody's trying to touch HHFK.
Okay, give kids a free breakfast... yes.
But it needs to happen before first period, not during first period.
Oh, we're talking about families of different means.
Getting their kids to school before class isn't practical.
Getting kids fed is directly related
- to how they perform in class.
- Nobody's arguing about providing a meal for the kids.
A-all they're talking about is when it happens.
Well, that's the problem.
We're not just talking about feeding kids.
This is a civil rights issue.
[Sighs]
What, is that... is that funny to you?
A civil rights issue?
For me, for a lot of people in this room.
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.
So what's the problem?
That the people being hurt don't look like you?
Or that little brown kids don't have rights?
We have a lot to cover tonight.
Does this even have anything to do with your school?
Not mine.
Ours.
We're supposed to be here to problem-solve.
So why don't we do that?
Days go by, year in and out.
And we're not talking about if we should be teaching Singapore math or if the reading levels are appropriate.
We are talking about what time to serve the kiddies food.
[Scoffs]
I have three degrees...
Two of them from I.U...
And I feel like a fast-food manager as much as a superintendent.
And Monica...
Oh.
She's fierce.
I like her.
I really respect her.
But she's a bleeding heart.
HHFK... good intentions, poorly executed.
It's that simple.
But nothing's that simple.
I want to do something about it, and you speaking to it, it means something.
I'm just trying to run my school.
Our schools.
Isn't that what you said?
Why stir things?
Too many teachers, they just want to keep their mouths shut, heads down, let the Unions fight it out with the legislator.
That solves what?
That's politics.
How's politics working for students?
You need help with your budget.
I don't need help.
Okay, my school needs help, and you're talking about grabbing a third rail.
You're not gonna get anyone to back you.
I need you to back me.
If I can win a few battles, then I can fight some new ones.
Then we can all start winning.
Doctor...
I'm seriously not trying to get into this.
[Door closes]
What's up?
Terri:
What's up?
Nothing.
Uh, Eric was talking about going to Chicago this weekend...
You have something you want to tell me?
Sit down.
Do you have something you want to tell me?
What is that?
Uh, [Clears throat] a receipt?
For what?
Do I really need to sit here and punk you?
I got her a gift.
Who?
Val.
You got her a $900 gift?
What, you thought I didn't check your credit-card receipts, or you thought I would be okay with you
- spending this kind of money?
- Hey, she's my... she's my girl.
How long have you been seeing her?
I don't know.
A couple of months?
Maybe?
What was it, Kevin?
A bracelet.
What did she promise you?
What did she tell you she was gonna do for that bracelet?
Nothing.
[Sighs]
We got into a fight.
Okay, so, you got her a slick bracelet, and because you were so slick, she got back with you and it was all good?
[Sighs]
Are you having sexual relations with her?
Mom, please don't say it like that.
Why...
- Well, how do you want me to say it?
- Any other way but that one.
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?
[Chuckles] Getting busy?
Nobody says any of those things.
That's what you all do?
No, she's... she's not like that.
Hmm, well, for $900, she could be.
That's how it's gonna be from now on.
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.
There are girls out there, they're gonna be coming hard at you for that.
They're gonna be trying to be your baby mama just so they can get paid.
That's how they are.
And the last time Val was anywhere near $900...
Do you think I'm stupid?
Some of these girls out here are gonna hope that you are.
Then how am I supposed to know?
Well, does her family have any money?
Because if her family has money, then she doesn't want anything from you.
But these other girls, running around here, broke, talking about, "I want me some rocks, show me the rocks," I...
Those are straight hos.
You can leave those for the WTs, 'cause you're better than that.

Yeah.
All right, now, you got to get it back.
Hm?
She doesn't get to keep a $900 bracelet.
But I gave it to her already.
What did you buy it with?
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.
Are you serious?
You get it back, Kevin, and you get it back today.
If not, I will go over there myself with the police, because as far as I'm concerned, she stole it.

Yeah.
Look, your school's not really a priority for me.
I don't have kids.
These are all our children.
I don't need the fundraising speech.
It's not a speech.
It's rich kids going to a rich kid's school.
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.
This is an opportunity for you to start building your own legacy.
The name that goes on the building is yours, not your father's.
A million dollars for naming rights, for the right to put your name where it matters.
You know a good deal when you see one.
Yeah.
I know a good pitch when I hear one, too.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
Let me think about it.
- Okay.
- Then we'll talk.
- You bet.
- I'll take care of these.
- Okay.
- You know what?
I'm gonna go to that gala of yours.
Put me down for a couple of tickets.
Okay, I will.
[Mumbled] Son of a bitch.
He talked to me like I was 8 years old.
"I went to public school."
The only reason he went to public school is 'cause his dad was running for office.
Nobody votes for a politician whose kids are in private.
I love that if the kids you care about come from means, you're not supposed to care about them.
I mean, even someone with money thinks that.
I just... ugh...
Getting sick of the whole dance.
Resign.
I'm sorry?
Resign.
That's really your career advice?
Is being headmaster really your career?
Capital development is my profession.
But it's not your school, so what do you care if...
Well, I could say it's not your company, so what do you care, except you have a long-term contract.
If people at that place aren't interested enough to put money into it...
"That place"?
This...
Is not a good topic for me.
Never is.
I care about what I do.
What I do is important.
Okay.
Here's the good news.
The goal is in sight.
Then I can learn to like New York and join you at your nameless, faceless, godless institution.

Yeah, great.
Fine.
Good.
Well, I think she'd like it.
Look, whatever you get your mom, she's gonna appreciate it.
We should throw her a surprise party.
She doesn't like surprises.
I like surprises, so we should do it.
It is a big birthday for your mom.
I don't know if it's the one we should be experimenting on.
Hey, um...
So, your mom, she wanted me to have a talk with you.
And, you know, just, uh...
You know, just be mindful of guys.
[Laughs]
Hey.
Hey, come on.
You know, guys are gonna be coming at you, and, you know, you need to be...
You need to be smart.

No.
No, like...

Well, it's kind of late for that.
To be talking about it.
I've seen porn.
That's where you think you learned about sex?
Well, you didn't talk about it.
Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think you know from a website.
No, I got it from people who know what I'm going through,
- people my age.
- Well, what are you going through?
- Well, what are you going through?
- I'm just...
I'm just going through life.
- Well, what does that mean... "I'm going through"?
- I'm just going through life.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.
But so... don't just...
Just don't...
- Every other word... "Don't."
- Do things just to do them.
Don't think some crap you see on the Internet or how other people tell you things are is...
It's not that big of a deal.
But it is a big deal.
Okay, it is a big deal if you do something wrong.
And not everybody gets that.
Did you see... you see those pictures that are going around?
The kid from school got drunk at the party?
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Everybody saw those.
Yeah, everybody saw those.
Everybody saw that he's a dumbass, and his life is ruined.
- He got drunk.
That's all.

Dan:
Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right?
And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him.
Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him.
So, I don't know why you have to assume
I'm gonna do something wrong.
I don't.
I just...
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
You okay?
Why did you show those pictures to my mom?
She already knew about them.
She kept texting me.
So?
Look, I didn't tell her nothing, 'cause I don't know nothing.
You should have been straight with her, first off.
Why would I tell her anything?
Because she's your mom.
And I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.
You don't talk to her.
You don't even talk to me anymore.
Look, I just don't want to talk about that.
- Are you good?
- I'm...
I just said I'm not trying to...
I just want to know if you're good.
You can tell me that, right?
[Sighs]
Damn.
Anne:
They keep blaming Taylor.
"Does he have a problem with drinking?"
"Does he have a problem with drugs?"
"Oh, just... just take him to see someone and go away."
Esposito:
How's Taylor doing?
Depressed?
He's just sad.
Does he engage with you at all?
I got him to see a doctor.
But I-I-I think that scared him more than helped him.
There doesn't have to be a rush to deal with this.
Victims are allowed time to decide if they want to pursue their case.
Well, he waited to say anything, and... and they act like it's his fault.
I waited to tell the police, and they... they say, you know, you're negligent.
There's a time, there's a window, for victims, when they're ready to talk.
It might...
I'm saying, consider it might be better for Taylor to wait until he's ready.
So I should just leave it alone?
You should make sure that what you're doing is having a positive effect on your son.
How are you holding up?
Eh.
If you start feeling overwhelmed, if you feel stressed or anxious...
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.
I'm fine.
Well, I'm not fine, but I'm okay.
Okay.

Name?
My name or...?
Your son's?
Taylor Blaine.
Taylor.
How old is he?
17.
And this is about last Saturday night...
- The party?
- Yeah.
The school's already been in contact with the department.
They gave us a summary of events, pictures.
That's your son?
Yes.
Was he drinking that night?
He did not get drunk.
Somebody put something in his drink.
Something what?
GHB?
They drugged him.
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.
Why would they want to give him drugs?
They don't like him.
That's a lot of effort just because you don't like somebody.
Why would they want...
I don't... that's...
that's... that's your job.
That's...
That's what you need to find out.
You really want to do this to your son?
My son was raped.
That's a specific category of crime.
Forced intercourse with a member of the opposite sex.
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.
They... they were taking pictures, there was drinking.
They... they talked about him online.
You can't do something about that?
- That's for the...
- You can't do something with that?
That's for the school to handle.
- Why?
It's a crime.
- Look...
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.
This is a lot to put them through.
Kids do dumb stuff.
Now, I'm not talking about your son, I'm talking about...
Look, I've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.
I'd maybe...
If you think your son's got a drinking problem or something, you should really try to get him some help.
Okay.
[Door closes]
You go to these people asking for help.
[Ringing] The minute you start talking, you can see it.
They don't believe you.
They... they don't... they won't even call it what it is because they don't think it happens to boys.
Then I start doubting myself.
Maybe I got it wrong.
S-so I go online, and I find all these articles.
Schools, sports teams, boys getting assaulted.
It happens more than you think.
I mean, that... that school wants to hide it.
The police want to ignore it.
I shouldn't have to beg people to care about my son.
I'm gonna take some notes.
Tell me what you know, and if there's something there, I'll pursue it.
The only thing I ask...
Can you not print my son's name?
I don't have to use his name.
But this article comes out, it's not gonna be hard for people to do the math.
They're gonna know where it's coming from.
So, before you say anything...
Are you sure you want to go public with this?
Yes, I am.

You know, Will Ferrell was in town.
He was not happy.
But I didn't know about it.
Look, whatever.
We're at Cherche Midi, all right?
Look, Dave, I don't know how to tell Will this, but I don't think I can work on this "Weatherman" show.

Jim, you really got to come to these meetings, okay?
"Weatherman" is not happening.
It's more of a fat guy role anyway, all right?
Will wants to do it next season with you.

Well, have you and Will talked to him about it?
I was wondering if you would talk to him.

No, I don't think that.
But I do think I can offer you the opportunity to audition for the role.
You want me to audition to play myself.
It would be fun to see what you'd do with the part.
I'm not auditioning to play myself.

Hey, look.
I'm just a simple edgy comedian who lives in Jersey City with his mom.
Trying to make this little blue marble a better place.
Dave and Jeannie kiss again.
[both speak indistinctly]
Must ha... have more tongue.
Oh, there's plenty more tongue to go around... and around.
[music crescendos dramatically]
And scene.
[all groaning]
God.
[clapping] Excellent.
All right, that's the end of act one.
Foshay, can you hand out act two?
[all groaning]
Wait, act one is over already?
[scoffs]
Mr. Ferrell, who are you talking to?
Have you taken your medication today?
What medication?
[chuckles]
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Ferrell, it appears you haven't taken your medication in over a month.
You get away from me, okay?
Or I'll report you to President Eisenhower.
- Let's go, Mr. Ferrell.
- Yes!
Unhand me, you cad.
I'm the mother of dragons!
I'm a mother of dragons!
[man humming and beatboxing]
It's too bad about Will, right?
I hope he's okay.
Network pinheads, man.
I mean, first they're all over me, right?
I mean, they're kissing my ass, right?
Now they... now they won't even return my phone calls, man.
I mean, they don't know how to deal with artists.
So, they pulled the plug, huh?
They canceled the whole project, man.
Hope it wasn't my Doughy Waiter line.
I think it's better for my career to have a show that's canceled.
My fans are gonna worship me like I'm a martyr.
I'm like Dave Chappelle.
What... didn't Chappelle have a really successful show
- that he walked away from?
- Exactly.
You know?
I don't care if they didn't like it.
I told my story.
All right?
Thanks for the advice, buddy.
- Hey, what are friends for?
- [chuckles]
Hey, so, ah, who's opening for you at Governor's next weekend?

- Hello?
- Please hold for Dave Marks.
- Jim, where are you?
- I'm at Katz's.
I've been waiting here for 20 minutes.
- Where are you guys?
- What are you doing at Katz's?
We agreed we weren't working there anymore.
We discussed this at the production meeting.
- What production meeting?
- The one yesterday.
The one you decided to blow off.
You know, Will Ferrell was in town.
He was not happy.
But I didn't know about it.
Look, whatever.
We're at Cherche Midi, all right?
Look, Dave, I don't know how to tell Will this, but I don't think I can work on this "Weatherman" show.
It... that was my idea.
Jim, you really got to come to these meetings, okay?
"Weatherman" is not happening.
It's more of a fat guy role anyway, all right?
Will wants to do it next season with you.
- He does?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look.
But in my show, he wants me to be a private investigator.
And you're supposed to be writing with us, so get over here.
and don't order anything.
I won't.
Ah, I'm on my way.
Oh, jeez.
Um...
I hate to be a pain, but could I also get fries?
Hi, I'm supposed to...
Excuse me, do you have an appointment with Mr. Marks?
An appointment?
Who... who are you?
I'm Dave's assistant, Foshay.
- L-look, Foshay.
- Foshay.
- Foshay.
Uh...
- Mr. Marks is in a meeting right now.
I thought we had a writers' meeting.
Thanks to your discourteous regard for our time, the writers' meeting has been postponed.
We have a tight schedule.
Right now, he's casting the role of landlady.
Land...
I don't have time for this.
- Uh-uh.
- Jim.
John.
Uh...
What are you doing over here?
Waiting for Dave.
This is ridiculous.
And who's Foshay?
It's actually pronounced Foshay.
- That's what I said.
Foshay.
- No, you said it differently.
All right, look, can we just start on the script?
Apparently we can't do any writing till Dave's free.
What are we even doing here?
Tell me about it.
Plus, he basically shoots down every idea I have now.
Well, have you and Will talked to him about it?
I was wondering if you would talk to him.
- Me?
- Well, you're friends.
Plus, you already have a reputation for being difficult.
I do?
Well, you blew off the production meeting.
But I...
I didn't know about it.
I'm not hungry.
Thank you.
You know what?
Um...
I'll get the steak frites.
- You want something?
- No, thank you.
He'll get the fries.
Get the fries.
They have this mayo that's, like, amazing here.
- Is it mayonnaise?
- Yeah.
Terrific.
Finally.
Let's go.
Come on, Foshay.
What now?
- He's talking to Dave.
- I know.
Why?
Hmm.
Dave, isn't this supposed to be a writers' session?
Relax, Jim, okay?
This is your lucky day, all right?
Both Louie Anderson and John Goodman passed on
- the Jim Gaffigan role.
I know.
- No.
- Oh, damn it.
- I know.
It's okay.
Did you try Bruce Vilanch?
- Oh.
Can he gain weight?
- He could gain weight.
You think after you rejected me for playing myself you can just offer me the role and I'll accept?
No, I don't think that.
But I do think I can offer you the opportunity to audition for the role.
You want me to audition to play myself.
It would be fun to see what you'd do with the part.
I'm not auditioning to play myself.
You're perfect for it.
Of course I'm perfect for it.
Where the hell's my phone?
You have to go in for it.
Do you really want some unknown actor to play Jim Gaffigan just because you were too proud to audition?
It could destroy your career.
Obviously they should just offer it to me.
Ugh.
Here it is.
Why is it there?
It's like I'm sure this audition is just some sort of a formality.
Jim, we're so close to being able to do our "Weatherman" project.
Can you imagine getting paid to be a writer and an actor?
We need this.
We're in a bidding war on our dream apartment.
- What bidding war?
- Just... just play ball.
You auditioning for Jim Gaffigan will totally change your reputation for being difficult.
I don't have a reputation for being difficult.
Ooh, I could help you with the audition.
I'm, like, an expert at this character.
I live with the guy.
I am the guy.
And you know, this guy has a wife.
Aren't you a little concerned how Dave Marks is gonna portray you on national television?
You said he's trying to get Kelly Ripa to play my part.
She's, like, so adorable.
- She's, like, perfect.
- He's not gonna get Kelly Ripa to quit her daytime talk show to do a sitcom on TV Land.
And what about our kids?
You know.
How are they gonna be portrayed?
Dave thinks that they're germ-infested monsters.
- Mom, James is eating boogers again.
- Ugh!
Wow, you really did your research.
I didn't shower.
Oh, my God.
You look exactly like him... but fatter.
But I am him.
M... me.

I mean, it's just fun to play a big fat slob.

- That's so exciting.
Can you gain 60 or 70 pounds?
Or, couldn't I wear, like, a fat suit or a prego pad?

Awesome.
Nailed it.
Good luck, Jimmy.
Okay, next up is Jim...
Gaffigan?
Th... uh, that's me.
All right, you can just put your stuff on the chair.
- I got this one.
- Okay.
Uh, Dave's not here?
Oh, the executive producer never comes to initial castings.
- You're going on tape.
- Oh, I just figured, you know, I know him.
I thought he'd be here.
Here's how it works.
For the first round, it's just the casting director.
Oh, you're the casting director.
No, I am the casting associate.
The casting director just left.
He has SoulCycle class.
He'll watch your tape.
If he likes it, he'll show it to the producers.
If they like it, you'll get what's called a callback.
I...
I understand.
I've auditioned before.
Okay, can we get started?
- Yes, please.
- Okay, great.
Slate: your name and the character.
Jim Gaffigan auditioning for...
Jim Gaffigan.
Okay, we're just gonna get into it.
I will cue you.
I will read as Dave.
And remember, you're a white-bread schlub trapped in a loveless marriage.
And...
"Jim, you turned down $1 million?"
Dave, I have five children that I have
- to feed...
- Oh, that's an old script.
You're gonna need the new pages.
- New pages?
But, ah...
- Yeah, those are, like, super old.
- Don't even regard this anymore.
- I'm...
I'm a writer on the show.
I...
All right, I'm just gonna keep the camera rolling.
And...
"Jim, you turned down $1 million?"
"Yes, um...
I know I need the money, but I'm not gonna let those Jews in Hollywood tell me..."
Wha... okay, wait.
I would never say this.
Could you just read the lines as written?
Okay, fine.
Um...
"Your people, Dave.
I'm not saying Hitler was right.
I'm just saying..."
Wait a minute.
You know, I...
I can't say this.
Hey, it-it's not you saying it.
It's the character saying it.
Jim Gaffigan is saying it.
But that's me.
I'm Jim Ga...
Lo... ah... you know, I...
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
Not everyone can.
But, you know, stick around.
I'd love to see you read for Doughy Waiter.
Okay.
Hey, John.
Hey, Jim.
How are you?
We got to do something about Dave.
These script rewrites are ridiculous.
Oh, you haven't heard?
I'm off that project now.
I'm in LA.
Yeah, Dave's all your problem now.
- LA?
- Yeah, it's the best.
Why would anyone make a TV show in New York City?
W-why do you get to quit?
Aren't you afraid of being perceived as difficult?
Oh, Jim, people love me.
I'm John Mulaney.
I'm adorable.
Jim, I'm gonna hang up now.
Who... who's writing the script?
Apparently Dave's writing the whole thing himself.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Dave is?
Beat it.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
I should have asked you to run this show in the first place.
I just didn't realize it until I fired Mulaney.
I thought Mulaney quit.
Why do you think I fired him?
Listen.
I need help with the script.
- The table read is tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- No one tells me anything.
- I don't know what to do.
"The...
The Weatherman" thing isn't happening.
You know, I-I-I'm no longer a private investigator.
F-F-Ferrell just told me to come up with something new.
You know, I-I-I don't know what that means.
I'm supposed to have been writing this entire time.
I got...
I-I got nothing.
Well, I can't write the script for you.
Haven't you tortured me enough?
I just bombed at an audition to play myself.
Audition?
What are you...
We already cast that role.
- W... with who?
- Can't you stop talking about yourself for just one minute, okay?
Can't you see I'm in a crisis?
I-I'm squandering the opportunity of a lifetime.
Ferrell's convinced that this show's gonna be epic.
Meanwhile, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just a fraud...
I'm a fraud.
I'm scared, man.
- I'm scared.
Y-y-y-you gotta help me.
- Well, the... the reason you're struggling is 'cause you're trying to make this show about other people's ideas.
You got this opportunity from TV Land because they saw you at Carolines.
You: an edgy stand-up comedian from Jersey City who lives with his mom.
You gotta write what you know.
Tell your story.
My story.
I don't know.
You think I can do it?
I know you can do it.
I mean, I'm pretty sure you can do it.
No, you're right.
I can do it.
You're... you're a true friend.
See you tomorrow?
I'll be there.
Okay.
I gotta go back to treating you like now.
- I understand.
- Good.
- What's this?
- Oh, Jim.
- What?
- My herb garden.
It's gone.
What herb garden?
We got outbid on our dream apartment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm diabetic, Ma!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, look at the size of that.
Just born that way.
Come on!
And you got me on my knees.
Ma, please, come on, the two of you!
Hello!
Hey, how's it goin'?
Everyone good?
Big day.
Can someone make me a cappuccino?
Two shots.
Ah, hi, Carol.
There's Carol.
There's Trent from Marketing.
Hi, Trent.
Hi.
There's Jim!
Jim, can you...
Uh, o-okay.
Hang on, everyone.
Hey, Jim.
Where's the script?
You don't have the script?
I don't have it.
No.
Uh... uh, well, you know, ah, I, uh, talked to Dave earlier.
He was just doing some finishing touches, and the script will be here in moments.
Okay, well, I'm just...
I'm just gonna cover, okay?
I...
I think everyone can hear us.
No, 'cause I'm whispering.
Uh, okay.
Welcome... everyone.

We are here, and we are waiting, uh, for a script.
Uh...
And that's the end of my speech.
Thanks.
Thanks for the...
Now, at this point, I would like to introduce the cocreator of the show, ah, Mr. Jim Gaffigan.
And, uh, Jim, why don't you tell everyone how we, ah, how we ended up here today?
Jim Gaffigan.
Uh, uh, okay.
Uh... hi.
I met Will when I was, ah, pitching him another idea for a show.
It was, ah, about a, ah.
weatherman who moves to New York.
Ah, the guy's from Gary, Indiana, you know, where they make the bathroom smell.
The bath.
- Yeah.
- A-a-and everyone in New York is really condescending to the weatherman.
They're like, "Oh, you from Indiana?
"Well, welcome.
This is electricity."
A-and what's great about this weatherman
- Hey.
Hey!
I'm here.
I'm here.
- is that he...
And here he is now.
Hi, Dave!
The epic voice of a generation.
Thank you, thank you.
Hi, Will.
Ah, I'm, ah, I'm Dave Marks.
I'm a writer, director, executive producer, creator, star of the, ah, "Dave Marks Show."
Let's open our scripts.
Exterior.
Night.
A crane shot swooshes down to dissolve to a hip downtown nightclub bistro, Cherche Midi.
The door bangs open like a clap of thunder and a French over shot reveals a casually sexy strapping youngish man in a tight leather jacket.
Every man wants to be him.
Every woman wants to be with him.
There was a hole, a hole in his heart that only a mother's love could fill.
Dave's beautiful date looks at him hungrily.
Doughy Waiter approaches.
Doughy Waiter approaches.
Jim!
Uh...
Uh, uh, would you like still or sparkling, madam?
Dave's friend Jim enters the room.
Girl, I can't watch eight kids by myself.
Jim's hot but bitchy wife, Jeannie, follows him in.
She wears a giant crucifix buried in her alabaster cleavage.
Her sheer, almost transparent white blouse reveals totally natural zaftig breasts that could feed an army.
That Dave Marks is so sexy.
Jeannie and Dave Marks share a brief kiss.
- That's not necessary.
Save it for
- Well, I thought it would...
- the day.
- wouldn't that help you a little or...
Begin... the animated sequence.
You might want to treat your woman with a little bit more respect.
Oh, is that right?
Is that what they do in heimy town?
Heimy town?
Come on!
Pshoo!
Jim, you give me the gun.
It's okay, man.
Watch out!
Oh.
Queue.
He's dead.
Foshay, he's dead.
Hey, look.
I'm just a simple edgy comedian who lives in Jersey City with his mom.
Trying to make this little blue marble a better place.
Dave and Jeannie kiss again.
Must ha... have more tongue.
Oh, there's plenty more tongue to go around... and around.
And scene.
God.
Excellent.
All right, that's the end of act one.
Foshay, can you hand out act two?
Wait, act one is over already?
Mr. Ferrell, who are you talking to?
Have you taken your medication today?
What medication?
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Ferrell, it appears you haven't taken your medication in over a month.
You get away from me, okay?
Or I'll report you to President Eisenhower.
- Let's go, Mr. Ferrell.

I hope he's okay.
Network pinheads, man.
I mean, first they're all over me, right?
I mean, they're kissing my ass, right?
Now they... now they won't even return my phone calls, man.
I mean, they don't know how to deal with artists.
So, they pulled the plug, huh?
They canceled the whole project, man.
Hope it wasn't my Doughy Waiter line.
I think it's better for my career to have a show that's canceled.
My fans are gonna worship me like I'm a martyr.
I'm like Dave Chappelle.
What... didn't Chappelle have a really successful show
- that he walked away from?
- Exactly.
You know?
I don't care if they didn't like it.
I told my story.
All right?
Thanks for the advice, buddy.
Hey, what are friends for?
Hey, so, ah, who's opening for you at Governor's next weekend?
- Hello?
- Please hold for Dave Marks.

- I'm at Katz's.

Oh, you haven't heard?
I'm off that project now.
I'm in LA.
Yeah, Dave's all your problem now.
- LA?
- Yeah, it's the best.
Why would anyone make a TV show in New York City?
W-why do you get to quit?
Aren't you afraid of being perceived as difficult?
Oh, Jim, people love me.
I'm John Mulaney.
I'm adorable.
Jim, I'm gonna hang up now.
Who... who's writing the script?
Apparently Dave's writing the whole thing himself.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Dave is?
Beat it.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
I should have asked you to run this show in the first place.
I just didn't realize it until I fired Mulaney.
I thought Mulaney quit.
Why do you think I fired him?
Listen.
I need help with the script.
- The table read is tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- No one tells me anything.
- I don't know what to do.
"The...
The Weatherman" thing isn't happening.
You know, I-I-I'm no longer a private investigator.
F-F-Ferrell just told me to come up with something new.
You know, I-I-I don't know what that means.
I'm supposed to have been writing this entire time.
I got...
I-I got nothing.
Well, I can't write the script for you.
Haven't you tortured me enough?
I just bombed at an audition to play myself.
Audition?
What are you...
We already cast that role.
- W... with who?
- Can't you stop talking about yourself for just one minute, okay?
Can't you see I'm in a crisis?
I-I'm squandering the opportunity of a lifetime.
Ferrell's convinced that this show's gonna be epic.
Meanwhile, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just a fraud...
I'm a fraud.
I'm scared, man.
- I'm scared.
Y-y-y-you gotta help me.
- Well, the... the reason you're struggling is 'cause you're trying to make this show about other people's ideas.
You got this opportunity from TV Land because they saw you at Carolines.
You: an edgy stand-up comedian from Jersey City who lives with his mom.
You gotta write what you know.
Tell your story.
My story.
I don't know.
You think I can do it?
I know you can do it.
I mean, I'm pretty sure you can do it.
No, you're right.
I can do it.
You're... you're a true friend.
See you tomorrow?
I'll be there.
Okay.
I gotta go back to treating you like now.
- I understand.
- Good.
- What's this?
- Oh, Jim.
- What?
- My herb garden.
It's gone.
What herb garden?
We got outbid on our dream apartment.
Oh, I'm sorry.

It was, ah, about a, ah.

Ah, the guy's from Gary, Indiana, you know, where they make the bathroom smell.
The bath.
- Yeah.
- A-a-and everyone in New York is really condescending to the weatherman.
They're like, "Oh, you from Indiana?
"Well, welcome.
This is electricity."

Hey!

Let's open our scripts.
Exterior.
Night.
A crane shot swooshes down to dissolve to a hip downtown nightclub bistro, Cherche Midi.
The door bangs open like a clap of thunder and a French over shot reveals a casually sexy strapping youngish man in a tight leather jacket.
Every man wants to be him.
Every woman wants to be with him.
There was a hole, a hole in his heart that only a mother's love could fill.
Dave's beautiful date looks at him hungrily.
Doughy Waiter approaches.
Doughy Waiter approaches.
Jim!
Uh...
Uh, uh, would you like still or sparkling, madam?
Dave's friend Jim enters the room.
Girl, I can't watch eight kids by myself.
Jim's hot but bitchy wife, Jeannie, follows him in.
She wears a giant crucifix buried in her alabaster cleavage.
Her sheer, almost transparent white blouse reveals totally natural zaftig breasts that could feed an army.
That Dave Marks is so sexy.
Jeannie and Dave Marks share a brief kiss.
- That's not necessary.
Save it for
- Well, I thought it would...
- the day.

Mr. Ferrell, who are you talking to?
Have you taken your medication today?
What medication?
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Ferrell, it appears you haven't taken your medication in over a month.
You get away from me, okay?
Or I'll report you to President Eisenhower.

I mean, they're kissing my ass, right?
Now they... now they won't even return my phone calls, man.
I mean, they don't know how to deal with artists.
So, they pulled the plug, huh?
They canceled the whole project, man.
Hope it wasn't my Doughy Waiter line.
I think it's better for my career to have a show that's canceled.
My fans are gonna worship me like I'm a martyr.
I'm like Dave Chappelle.
What... didn't Chappelle have a really successful show
- that he walked away from?
- Exactly.
You know?
I don't care if they didn't like it.
I told my story.
All right?
Thanks for the advice, buddy.
Hey, what are friends for?
Hey, so, ah, who's opening for you at Governor's next weekend?

What?
Yo, our Adderall sales are through the roof today!
Is it SAT season already?
Naw, it's the "Hoop or Die" Tournament, my man.
It's the March Madness of video games.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
We should be marching about the madness, but the madness has us playing "Madden"
and marchin' about being mad but...
Man, you know what I'm talkin' about.
- I'm confused and stuff, ese.
- Look, all I'm sayin' is, the boost in Adderall sales is just the tip of the iceberg.
This is an opportunity to crack these crackers over the head and game these gamers out of their gaming money.
- Now, that's game, homes.
- Two for $40.
[clears throat] I mean $60.
Damn, you giving me the tourist prices, player?
Surge pricing, like Guber.
Look, player, you buy or you go!
Hold up.
Slow your roll.
I gotta check you first.
LaDante?
What are you doing here?
My side hustle, fool.
Now spread them legs.
I wanna make sure you're not packin'.
That's good right there.
That's all you?
Mm.
You need to wax.
I got a Brazilian that can take care of that for you.
Empty you out at the end too.
Damn, Jared.
Get off my footlong.
- You mean six-inch.
- Whoa, whoa!
I'm just here to qualify.
Next.
Step up.
Bring that ass.
It's a long bench ride for those ass muscles.
God forbid there's a triple overtime.
So to keep them cheeks loose and from falling asleep, you're gonna have to stretch 'em.
- Stretch your what?
- Gluteus maximus.
Hold up.
That's that Roman white boy
- with mad squabbles, right?
- No, no, no.
This is serious.
In addition to being the new pussy, the ass is the most important muscle to stretch when riding the bench.
Let me tell you a little story.
I was there when benchwarmer and noted philanthropist
Donny LarMue picked up a wet penny in his Jordache jeans using only his ass.
And you know why he was able to do that?
Huh?
Do you know why, huh?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Because he stretched his fucking glutes.
Now grab your butt cheeks.
I said grab 'em!
Squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
And squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
I don't hear you!

Damn, LaDante, you got skills!
You think you can give me some more tips?
Why the hell should I help you?
I'm just trying to prove to Montrel that I'm just as much of a man as he is.
You need to prove you a man?
[chuckles] I can help you with your manhood.
[sniffs]
Mmm, herbal essences.
Yeah, I got yo' tip.
Meet me at my house tonight.
And wear something really cute.
Damn, you smell good.
Hey, LaDante, um, this hand massage feels cool, but what's it got to do with the tournament?
First rule of training is shut the fuck up.
Your hands loose?
Yeah, my G. They actually feel relaxed.
- Now let's work on that ass.
- What?
A little prison joke.
Always kills on the yard.
[laughs] [metal clanking] What's this for?
Our first training session.
[grunts]
Ugh.
This is called "Wash the Draws." Now get to it.
How'd you get so good at "Hoop or Die" anyway?
My cellmate Clark was a beast on them sticks.
He was nice with them fingers.
He could push all the right buttons.
He was good at video games too.
Uh, LaDante, look, man, I'm scrubbing, but I think whatever you spilled is in the fabric.
Keep scrubbing', nigga, if you want to win.
Me and Clark about to go play "Call of Booty."
[laughing]
You see, this is one of the most important skills that you're gonna learn at this camp:
- the art of towel waving.
- It's just waving a towel.
"Just waving a towel" saved my grandfather's career.
Man, this is lame and a shame.
We getting our tuchus kicked, Jack.
You need to stop jiving.
We need to encourage these youngbloods and raise their spirits.
We need to get Mr. Bird flying'.
Man, ain't nothing we can do from this here bench.
Shit, hand me that towel.
I'm 'bout to get these white folks to give us some energy, baby.
Wow.
I've never witnessed anything like this.
Thecrowdhascomealive and willed this team into a victory!
TheMVPof thisgame is the towel!
My grandfather was on the verge of retiring when he pioneered this very towel wave that gets white folks hyped.
This move, this move here, huh, this move right here, it got him six additional years in the league, and it kept us...
and it kept us... it kept us out of public... public school, public housing, public transportation... [clears throat] Sorry.
Towels up!
Now twist it around your hand and spin it like a helicopter!
Spin it.
Spin it.
That's right.

Great question.
You know, we don't come up on floor-seat breezys like we'd like. [all groaning]
But we do be soaki" in them cheap-seat chickens.

- Naw, homey, we ain't sitting'.
- I said sit!
- Hell no!
We'd rather die on our feet than live on our cheeks.
None of us are sitting, Coach.
We're never sitting again.
- Ain't nobody say all that.
- Fine, you fucking losers.
But just know, you ain't gettin' no refund.
I already cashed them checks, biatches!

Who's the least likely to win, homes?
This guy who hates cats.
His name is No Pussy Nippsy.
Oh, no, it's not about the cats.
It means he never stuck his thingy in a girl before.
Ugh, why would anyone ever want to do that?

But if you won, you was gonna be playing me.
Why I'ma play when I can get paid?
That's idiot.
Damn, you the worst big brother in the world.
Now, when I called you a bitch earlier, it was simply an idiom.
But, cuz, you really is a bitch.
Man, you know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.
Now, hold up, Grove.
We all know there's no way you could ever in your life whup my ass in anything.
But I can help you whup this other bitch, though.
[upbeat music] [cheering]
All right, little bro, now, if you gon' beat this bitch, you gon' need my secret move.

- Let's go, Grove.

So sorry.
[applause]
Aye, man.
Bitch cold.
So what was good with that elite basketball camp?
Dem meatballs!
Aw, man, we was way too league for that bullshit.
It was like playing with a bunch
- of mark-ass benchwarmers.
- Aye, man.
Even though you got that ass spanked, I still respect you.
I would have given you my secret, secret move,
- but I ain't no snitch, though.
- You know what 'Trel?
You ain't the smartest, but you ain't such a bad brother after all.
Oh, nigga, I know.
That's why I got you this.
Suzy gave you that?
Naw, I robbed that ass.
Now let's dip.
I think Suzy's management called one time.
We gotta bounce out this bitch.

No, no, I'm talking about the basketball player.

I'm tired of living in your shadow.
You must have got that contact high, 'cause you straight trippin'.
You gon' always be in my shadow.
Now kick rocks!
This couch is for qualified "Hoop or Die-ers" only.
That's all right, Andre Negro Dolla.
When I win, I won't need a couch, 'cause I'ma sit on yo' face.
You sit on my face, and I'ma eat your ass alive.
- Wait.
What?
- Wait a minute.
What?
Yo, our Adderall sales are through the roof today!
Is it SAT season already?
Naw, it's the "Hoop or Die" Tournament, my man.
It's the March Madness of video games.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
We should be marching about the madness, but the madness has us playing "Madden"
and marchin' about being mad but...
Man, you know what I'm talkin' about.
- I'm confused and stuff, ese.
- Look, all I'm sayin' is, the boost in Adderall sales is just the tip of the iceberg.
This is an opportunity to crack these crackers over the head and game these gamers out of their gaming money.
- Now, that's game, homes.
- Two for $40.
I mean $60.
Damn, you giving me the tourist prices, player?
Surge pricing, like Guber.
Look, player, you buy or you go!
Hold up.
Slow your roll.
I gotta check you first.
LaDante?
What are you doing here?
My side hustle, fool.
Now spread them legs.
I wanna make sure you're not packin'.
That's good right there.
That's all you?
Mm.
You need to wax.
I got a Brazilian that can take care of that for you.
Empty you out at the end too.
Damn, Jared.
Get off my footlong.
- You mean six-inch.
- Whoa, whoa!
I'm just here to qualify.
Next.
Step up.
Bring that ass.
It's a long bench ride for those ass muscles.
God forbid there's a triple overtime.
So to keep them cheeks loose and from falling asleep, you're gonna have to stretch 'em.
- Stretch your what?
- Gluteus maximus.
Hold up.
That's that Roman white boy
- with mad squabbles, right?
- No, no, no.
This is serious.
In addition to being the new pussy, the ass is the most important muscle to stretch when riding the bench.
Let me tell you a little story.
I was there when benchwarmer and noted philanthropist
Donny LarMue picked up a wet penny in his Jordache jeans using only his ass.
And you know why he was able to do that?
Huh?
Do you know why, huh?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Because he stretched his fucking glutes.
Now grab your butt cheeks.
I said grab 'em!
Squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
And squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
I don't hear you!
Squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
Dis nigga.
Come on, Grove, get it together.
You can't lose to Benny Hana.
Triangle, triangle, square, then double-tap circle.
Yeah, now what's up?
Now who wanna fade Grover?
Cookthatnigga!
Oh, hell yeah!
Damn, LaDante, you got skills!
You think you can give me some more tips?
Why the hell should I help you?
I'm just trying to prove to Montrel that I'm just as much of a man as he is.
You need to prove you a man?
I can help you with your manhood.
Mmm, herbal essences.
Yeah, I got yo' tip.
Meet me at my house tonight.
And wear something really cute.
Damn, you smell good.
Hey, LaDante, um, this hand massage feels cool, but what's it got to do with the tournament?
First rule of training is shut the fuck up.
Your hands loose?
Yeah, my G. They actually feel relaxed.
- Now let's work on that ass.
- What?
A little prison joke.
Always kills on the yard.
What's this for?
Our first training session.
Ugh.
This is called "Wash the Draws." Now get to it.
How'd you get so good at "Hoop or Die" anyway?
My cellmate Clark was a beast on them sticks.
He was nice with them fingers.
He could push all the right buttons.
He was good at video games too.
Uh, LaDante, look, man, I'm scrubbing, but I think whatever you spilled is in the fabric.
Keep scrubbing', nigga, if you want to win.
Me and Clark about to go play "Call of Booty."
You see, this is one of the most important skills that you're gonna learn at this camp:
- the art of towel waving.
- It's just waving a towel.
"Just waving a towel" saved my grandfather's career.
Man, this is lame and a shame.
We getting our tuchus kicked, Jack.
You need to stop jiving.
We need to encourage these youngbloods and raise their spirits.
We need to get Mr. Bird flying'.
Man, ain't nothing we can do from this here bench.
Shit, hand me that towel.
I'm 'bout to get these white folks to give us some energy, baby.
Wow.
I've never witnessed anything like this.
Thecrowdhascomealive and willed this team into a victory!
TheMVPof thisgame is the towel!
My grandfather was on the verge of retiring when he pioneered this very towel wave that gets white folks hyped.
This move, this move here, huh, this move right here, it got him six additional years in the league, and it kept us...
and it kept us... it kept us out of public... public school, public housing, public transportation...
Sorry.
Towels up!
Now twist it around your hand and spin it like a helicopter!
Spin it.
Spin it.
That's right.
Spin it!
♪ I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all ♪
All right, campers, I got a special treat for you today.
Give it up for two legends of the pine,
Mark Madsen and Cole Aldrich.
Man, you can't be no legend riding the pine.
You right.
These scrubs are liquid dookie.
Okay, guys, let's start with some questions.
Yes, fat kid.
What was the highlight of your career that we never knew you had?
Good question.
Glad you asked.
Stealing the moment from Shaq Diesel and "Nappy Fro" Kobe at the Championship Parade.
My dance skills are legendary.
Man, this corny-ass cracker ain't got no rhythms.
Oh, yeah.
Me, me, me, me!
Do you guys eat at, like, the finest restaurants,
- like, every night?
- Ooh, that's such a good question.
Shit, my Gs, I usually eat at the crib, unless I'm trying to get it in.
Then I'll take a chicken to Houston's.
I know y'all scrubs and all.
No offense.
But do y'all get any groupie love?
And if so, do they let y'all go raw?
Great question.
You know, we don't come up on floor-seat breezys like we'd like.
But we do be soaki" in them cheap-seat chickens.
Word, Mark, the groupie hos generally want the starters.
And with the invention of Google, these greedy-ass tricks can now check your contracts.
Shit, the game's fucked up now, guys.
So this is our future?
I don't know, my nig.
Man, fuck these lames.
I'd rather keep slangin' my nine in my blow-up doll than some ole ratchet-ass balcony biatches.
Yo, you know what?
Tell all the bench warmers to meet us back up here tonight.
We finna change the game.

Super OG LaDante, you all good, big homey?
It's the fourth anniversary of the day my life partner got locked up.
How do you lock up a face like this?
How do you?
!
I know you walking down memory lane and all that,
- but the tournament is tomorrow.
- Clark!
- Clark could cook!
- Hey, uh, big man,
I need a last-second training session, though.
- How do I block missiles if I'm...
- You talkin' about a game.
I'm talkin' about love.
- You should go, Grover.
- But...
Go!
Get the fuck outta here!
Clark!
Thanks for gathering on such short notice.
Check this out, y'all.
- These camp counselors think we suck.
- Well, we do.
I don't know about y'all, but I started playing basketball to get a bunch of big brown booties pregnant.
We can't get no groupies pregnant from the bench.
That's right.
So you know what I say?
- I say we hoops!
- We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
Yo, Elbows, go to work, homey.
Like I said, we hoops.
Game!
What?
Told y'all, busters.
Great game, dudes.
That was intense.
There's a reason why you ass-clowns are at a benchwarmers' camp.
Now, whose bright idea was this?
- Fine, all of you sit down.
- Naw, homey, we ain't sitting'.
- I said sit!
- Hell no!
We'd rather die on our feet than live on our cheeks.
None of us are sitting, Coach.
We're never sitting again.
- Ain't nobody say all that.
- Fine, you fucking losers.
But just know, you ain't gettin' no refund.
I already cashed them checks, biatches!
The only way we beat the house is to find someone who's undervalued and overcome the odds.
Who's the least likely to win, homes?
This guy who hates cats.
His name is No Pussy Nippsy.
Oh, no, it's not about the cats.
It means he never stuck his thingy in a girl before.
Ugh, why would anyone ever want to do that?
Who knows?
But I ran the numbers, and none of the last three champions ever got any pussy.
- Check the graph.
- That's how we're gonna get paid.
We puttin' all our money on No Pussy Nippsy.
WillplayerGroverplease report to your game station?
Grover.
Player Grover.
- What the hell is yo' problem?
- Your training was some bullshit.
All I did was pop blackheads and wash dirty draws.
How is that gonna help me win the tournament?
Man, I might as well give up.
Give up?
You France now, le negro?
- No, I just...
- Then show me "Wash the Draws."
- Huh?
- "Wash the Draws"!
Concentrate, Clark...
I mean Grover.
You play with your hands, but you win with your head.
Understand?
Better.
Now show me "Pop the Pimple."
Focus!
Now put all the techniques together.
Now you ready.
Guess who got paroled, you big ole homo.
- I'm finally home.

Clark, is that you?
Hey, where are you going with my trainer?
Don't let this sweet Justin Bieber face fool you.
I will cut a motherfucker.
Clark, where are we going, boo-boo?
We're going home, baby.
We're going home.
Malik, we got a big problem, my man.
No Pussy just got pussy, homes.
We bet everything on him.
That means we both got screwed.
It's like y'all don't know who Malik is.
This is AP Hustle 101.
There's always a contingency.
Hey, Montrel, let me holler at you real quick.
I'm glad they kicked us out.
I'm ready to go home anyways.
This ain't no place for a real nig.
Grover's right.
That do feel good.
Now say it again and emphasize the E-R.
Who I look like, Boo Boo the foo', my nig?
You don't deserve this.
You guys really disappointed me.
The feeling is mutual.
I mean, who disables the soft-serve machine in the cafeteria?
We ain't always finna be benchwarmers.
I gots real potentials.
Uh, no, you don't.
Four minutes a game, at best.
You're a privileged wannabe.
You'll end up managing a bad rap group or, worse, writing for a black TV show on Comedy Central,

- Eat a black dick!
Here go one right here.
Yeah, nigga, that's right, we took all y'all Oriental shit.
We got Bruce Lee, Kimora Lee, Sara Lee, and now we 'bout to take y'all video games.

Man, ain't nobody worried about being dolo, you wide-faced bitch.

This couch is for qualified "Hoop or Die-ers" only.
That's all right, Andre Negro Dolla.
When I win, I won't need a couch, 'cause I'ma sit on yo' face.
You sit on my face, and I'ma eat your ass alive.
- Wait.
What?
- Wait a minute.
What?
Yo, our Adderall sales are through the roof today!
Is it SAT season already?
Naw, it's the "Hoop or Die" Tournament, my man.
It's the March Madness of video games.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
We should be marching about the madness, but the madness has us playing "Madden"
and marchin' about being mad but...
Man, you know what I'm talkin' about.
- I'm confused and stuff, ese.
- Look, all I'm sayin' is, the boost in Adderall sales is just the tip of the iceberg.
This is an opportunity to crack these crackers over the head and game these gamers out of their gaming money.
- Now, that's game, homes.
- Two for $40.
I mean $60.
Damn, you giving me the tourist prices, player?
Surge pricing, like Guber.
Look, player, you buy or you go!
Hold up.
Slow your roll.
I gotta check you first.
LaDante?
What are you doing here?
My side hustle, fool.
Now spread them legs.
I wanna make sure you're not packin'.
That's good right there.
That's all you?
Mm.
You need to wax.
I got a Brazilian that can take care of that for you.
Empty you out at the end too.
Damn, Jared.
Get off my footlong.
- You mean six-inch.
- Whoa, whoa!
I'm just here to qualify.
Next.
Step up.
Bring that ass.
It's a long bench ride for those ass muscles.
God forbid there's a triple overtime.
So to keep them cheeks loose and from falling asleep, you're gonna have to stretch 'em.
- Stretch your what?
- Gluteus maximus.
Hold up.
That's that Roman white boy
- with mad squabbles, right?
- No, no, no.
This is serious.
In addition to being the new pussy, the ass is the most important muscle to stretch when riding the bench.
Let me tell you a little story.
I was there when benchwarmer and noted philanthropist
Donny LarMue picked up a wet penny in his Jordache jeans using only his ass.
And you know why he was able to do that?
Huh?
Do you know why, huh?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Because he stretched his [bleep]ing glutes.
Now grab your butt cheeks.
I said grab 'em!
Squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
And squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
I don't hear you!
Squeeze and move and squeeze and move.
Dis nigga.
Come on, Grove, get it together.
You can't lose to Benny Hana.
Triangle, triangle, square, then double-tap circle.
Yeah, now what's up?
Now who wanna fade Grover?
Cookthatnigga!
Oh, hell yeah!
Damn, LaDante, you got skills!
You think you can give me some more tips?
Why the hell should I help you?
I'm just trying to prove to Montrel that I'm just as much of a man as he is.
You need to prove you a man?
I can help you with your manhood.
Mmm, herbal essences.
Yeah, I got yo' tip.
Meet me at my house tonight.
And wear something really cute.
Damn, you smell good.
Hey, LaDante, um, this hand massage feels cool, but what's it got to do with the tournament?
First rule of training is shut the [bleep] up.
Your hands loose?
Yeah, my G. They actually feel relaxed.
- Now let's work on that ass.
- What?
A little prison joke.
Always kills on the yard.
What's this for?
Our first training session.
Ugh.
This is called "Wash the Draws." Now get to it.
How'd you get so good at "Hoop or Die" anyway?
My cellmate Clark was a beast on them sticks.
He was nice with them fingers.
He could push all the right buttons.
He was good at video games too.
Uh, LaDante, look, man, I'm scrubbing, but I think whatever you spilled is in the fabric.
Keep scrubbing', nigga, if you want to win.
Me and Clark about to go play "Call of Booty."
You see, this is one of the most important skills that you're gonna learn at this camp:
- the art of towel waving.
- It's just waving a towel.
"Just waving a towel" saved my grandfather's career.
Man, this is lame and a shame.
We getting our tuchus kicked, Jack.
You need to stop jiving.
We need to encourage these youngbloods and raise their spirits.
We need to get Mr. Bird flying'.
Man, ain't nothing we can do from this here bench.

I'm 'bout to get these white folks to give us some energy, baby.
Wow.

My grandfather was on the verge of retiring when he pioneered this very towel wave that gets white folks hyped.

How do you?

I know you walking down memory lane and all that,

- Clark!
- Clark could cook!
- Hey, uh, big man,
I need a last-second training session, though.
- How do I block missiles if I'm...
- You talkin' about a game.
I'm talkin' about love.
- You should go, Grover.
- But...
Go!
Get the [bleep] outta here!
Clark!
Thanks for gathering on such short notice.
Check this out, y'all.
- These camp counselors think we suck.
- Well, we do.
I don't know about y'all, but I started playing basketball to get a bunch of big brown booties pregnant.
We can't get no groupies pregnant from the bench.
That's right.
So you know what I say?
- I say we hoops!
- We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
Yo, Elbows, go to work, homey.
Like I said, we hoops.
Game!
What?
Told y'all, busters.
Great game, dudes.
That was intense.
There's a reason why you ass-clowns are at a benchwarmers' camp.
Now, whose bright idea was this?
- Fine, all of you sit down.
- Naw, homey, we ain't sitting'.
- I said sit!
- Hell no!
We'd rather die on our feet than live on our cheeks.
None of us are sitting, Coach.
We're never sitting again.
- Ain't nobody say all that.
- Fine, you [bleep]ing losers.
But just know, you ain't gettin' no refund.
I already cashed them checks, biatches!
The only way we beat the house is to find someone who's undervalued and overcome the odds.
Who's the least likely to win, homes?
This guy who hates cats.
His name is No Pussy Nippsy.
Oh, no, it's not about the cats.
It means he never stuck his thingy in a girl before.
Ugh, why would anyone ever want to do that?
Who knows?
But I ran the numbers, and none of the last three champions ever got any pussy.
- Check the graph.
- That's how we're gonna get paid.
We puttin' all our money on No Pussy Nippsy.
WillplayerGroverplease report to your game station?
Grover.
Player Grover.
- What the hell is yo' problem?
- Your training was some bullshit.
All I did was pop blackheads and wash dirty draws.
How is that gonna help me win the tournament?
Man, I might as well give up.
Give up?
You France now, le negro?
- No, I just...
- Then show me "Wash the Draws."
- Huh?
- "Wash the Draws"!
Concentrate, Clark...
I mean Grover.
You play with your hands, but you win with your head.
Understand?
Better.
Now show me "Pop the Pimple."
Focus!
Now put all the techniques together.
Now you ready.
Guess who got paroled, you big ole homo.

Hey, where are you going with my trainer?
Don't let this sweet Justin Bieber face fool you.

We're going home, baby.
We're going home.
Malik, we got a big problem, my man.
No Pussy just got pussy, homes.
We bet everything on him.
That means we both got screwed.
It's like y'all don't know who Malik is.
This is AP Hustle 101.
There's always a contingency.
Hey, Montrel, let me holler at you real quick.
I'm glad they kicked us out.
I'm ready to go home anyways.
This ain't no place for a real nig.
Grover's right.
That do feel good.
Now say it again and emphasize the E-R.
Who I look like, Boo Boo the foo', my nig?
You don't deserve this.
You guys really disappointed me.
The feeling is mutual.
I mean, who disables the soft-serve machine in the cafeteria?
We ain't always finna be benchwarmers.
I gots real potentials.
Uh, no, you don't.
Four minutes a game, at best.
You're a privileged wannabe.
You'll end up managing a bad rap group or, worse, writing for a black TV show on Comedy Central,

Looks like we both assed out.
Don't worry, 'Trel.
Just rest up.

- And the Image Award goes to...
Aye, I told you I wanted these in singles, nigga, damn!
But if you won, you was gonna be playing me.
Why I'ma play when I can get paid?
That's idiot.
Damn, you the worst big brother in the world.
Now, when I called you a bitch earlier, it was simply an idiom.
But, cuz, you really is a bitch.
Man, you know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.
Now, hold up, Grove.
We all know there's no way you could ever in your life whup my ass in anything.
But I can help you whup this other bitch, though.
All right, little bro, now, if you gon' beat this bitch, you gon' need my secret move.

So sorry.
Aye, man.

So what was good with that elite basketball camp?
Dem meatballs!
Aw, man, we was way too league for that bullshit.
It was like playing with a bunch

- Aye, man.
Even though you got that ass spanked, I still respect you.
I would have given you my secret, secret move,

- You know what 'Trel?
You ain't the smartest, but you ain't such a bad brother after all.
Oh, nigga, I know.
That's why I got you this.
Suzy gave you that?
Naw, I robbed that ass.

Go!
Get the [bleep] outta here!
[yells] Clark!
[sobbing]
Thanks for gathering on such short notice.
Check this out, y'all.
- These camp counselors think we suck.
- Well, we do.
[all murmuring agreement]
I don't know about y'all, but I started playing basketball to get a bunch of big brown booties pregnant.
[all murmuring agreement]
We can't get no groupies pregnant from the bench.
That's right.
So you know what I say?
- I say we hoops!
- We hoops!
Both:
We hoops!
[All chanting] We hoops!
We hoops!
We hoops!
Yo, Elbows, go to work, homey.
[dramatic music]
Like I said, we hoops.
[whistle shrills] [upbeat music]
[all cheering] [dramaticmusic] [distortedclanks] [buzzer blares] [all cheering]
Game!
What?
Told y'all, busters.
[claps hands]
Great game, dudes.
That was intense.
There's a reason why you ass-clowns are at a benchwarmers' camp.
Now, whose bright idea was this?
- Fine, all of you sit down.
- Naw, homey, we ain't sitting'.
- I said sit!
- Hell no!
We'd rather die on our feet than live on our cheeks.
None of us are sitting, Coach.
We're never sitting again.
- Ain't nobody say all that.
- Fine, you [bleep]ing losers.
But just know, you ain't gettin' no refund.
I already cashed them checks, biatches!
The only way we beat the house is to find someone who's undervalued and overcome the odds.
Who's the least likely to win, homes?
This guy who hates cats.
His name is No Pussy Nippsy.
Oh, no, it's not about the cats.
It means he never stuck his thingy in a girl before.
Ugh, why would anyone ever want to do that?
Who knows?
But I ran the numbers, and none of the last three champions ever got any pussy.
- Check the graph.
- That's how we're gonna get paid.
We puttin' all our money on No Pussy Nippsy.
[dramatic music]
WillplayerGroverplease report to your game station?
Grover.
Player Grover.
- What the hell is yo' problem?
- Your training was some bullshit.
All I did was pop blackheads and wash dirty draws.
How is that gonna help me win the tournament?
Man, I might as well give up.
Give up?
You France now, le negro?
- No, I just...
- Then show me "Wash the Draws."
- Huh?
- "Wash the Draws"!
Concentrate, Clark...
I mean Grover.
You play with your hands, but you win with your head.
Understand?
Better.
Now show me "Pop the Pimple."
Focus!
Now put all the techniques together.
[inspirational music]
Now you ready.
[upbeat music]
[video game blipping]
[video game blipping]
Guess who got paroled, you big ole homo.
- I'm finally home.
- Clark?
Clark, is that you?
[groans]
Hey, where are you going with my trainer?
Don't let this sweet Justin Bieber face fool you.
I will cut a mother[bleep]er.
Clark, where are we going, boo-boo?
We're going home, baby.
We're going home.
Malik, we got a big problem, my man.
No Pussy just got pussy, homes.
We bet everything on him.
That means we both got screwed.
It's like y'all don't know who Malik is.
This is AP Hustle 101.
There's always a contingency.
Hey, Montrel, let me holler at you real quick.
I'm glad they kicked us out.
I'm ready to go home anyways.
This ain't no place for a real nig.
Aah!
Grover's right.
That do feel good.
Now say it again and emphasize the E-R.
Who I look like, Boo Boo the foo', my nig?
Aah!
You don't deserve this.
You guys really disappointed me.
The feeling is mutual.
I mean, who disables the soft-serve machine in the cafeteria?
We ain't always finna be benchwarmers.
I gots real potentials.
Uh, no, you don't.
Four minutes a game, at best.
You're a privileged wannabe.
You'll end up managing a bad rap group or, worse, writing for a black TV show on Comedy Central,
- [bleep]ing losers.
- Eat a black [bleep]!
Here go one right here.
Yeah, nigga, that's right, we took all y'all Oriental shit.
We got Bruce Lee, Kimora Lee, Sara Lee, and now we 'bout to take y'all video games.
You know, you talkin' a lot of trash to be rolling dolo.
Man, ain't nobody worried about being dolo, you wide-faced bitch.
Ow!
Oh!
I think I pulled all my ass muscles!
Come on, 'Trel, stop messin' around.
This is my shot at finally beating you and getting your respect.
Sorry, lil bro-bro.
Looks like we both assed out.
Don't worry, 'Trel.
Just rest up.
I'm finna represent for the family.
Man, don't sweat that, Grove.
I faked that shit.
- What?
- Man, Malik needed me to throw
- my next match, so, you know...
- And the Image Award goes to...
Aye, I told you I wanted these in singles, nigga, damn!
But if you won, you was gonna be playing me.
Why I'ma play when I can get paid?
That's idiot.
Damn, you the worst big brother in the world.
Now, when I called you a bitch earlier, it was simply an idiom.
But, cuz, you really is a bitch.
Man, you know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.
Now, hold up, Grove.
We all know there's no way you could ever in your life whup my ass in anything.
But I can help you whup this other bitch, though.
[upbeat music] [cheering]
All right, little bro, now, if you gon' beat this bitch, you gon' need my secret move.
[whispering]
- Let's go, Grove.
- Yeah, Grover, you got this!
- Bust that breezy's ass.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
Andinthree,two ,one .
Gametime!
[chittering]
- Damn, little girl.
- [giggles] So sorry.
Ha!
Get 'em a body bag, Suzy!
[machinegunfire]
In yo' mouth!
- Bust that thang open!
- Yeah, Grover, you my nig!
Now hit her with that secret sauce.
[whooshing]
Man, my dick is so hard right now.
Cook her, nigga!
[giggles] [smooches] [squelching]
So sorry.
[applause]
Aye, man.
Bitch cold.
So what was good with that elite basketball camp?
Dem meatballs!
Aw, man, we was way too league for that bullshit.
It was like playing with a bunch
- of mark-ass benchwarmers.
- Aye, man.
Even though you got that ass spanked, I still respect you.
I would have given you my secret, secret move,
- but I ain't no snitch, though.
- You know what 'Trel?
You ain't the smartest, but you ain't such a bad brother after all.
Oh, nigga, I know.
That's why I got you this.
Suzy gave you that?
Naw, I robbed that ass.
Now let's dip.
I think Suzy's management called one time.
We gotta bounce out this bitch.
[wailing sirens]
[man over radio] The losses on the value of your 401[k]s or IRAs in the last few years.
Uh-oh.
Looks like the interns are slacking off again.
Hey, Kyle.
What's up?
[woman] The gunman was described as a loner...
I'm right behind you.
[woman] Jill, let's go.
It's time for school.
Hi, stranger. [chuckles]
Bye.
Have fun.
[elevator beeps] [smooches] Come on.
Bye.
So, any big plans this weekend?
[man] Fuck you.
Fuck you.
[chuckles] Fuck you.
Oh, man.
Fuck you, man.
[man laughing]
- Oh, fuck.
- Chad?
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
That's so fucked up.
- Are you Kyle?
- Yeah.
Hi.
The front desk says your wife is here.
Some kind of emergency.
Oh, uh, thank you.
[laughing]
Hi.
Hey, excuse me.
Did my...?
Is my wife here?
My name's Kyle Madison.
Her name's Mary.
She said there might be some...
- I'm right here.
It's okay.
- Jesus!
Wait.
What the fuck, ma...?
Oh, my God.
What?
Zack?
- Kyle?
- What?
Come here, brother.
- What are you doing?
How are you?
- Oh, Jesus.
- Look at that.
Fresh-faced.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Wow.
This is crazy timing.
Apparently my wife is here
- with some kind of emergency...
- Emergency.
- Okay.
Wow.
- Okay. [laughs]
- Right?
Come on, I got you out of school.
- Okay.
- Let's go play.
- Oh, Jesus.
No, man, I... [chuckles] Can you hang out in my office for like ten, 20, 30 minutes?
- I can do ten, 20.
- Okay, come on.
[Kyle] So, how have you been?
What happened to you?
Uh, you know, I've...
I've been. [chuckles]
I mean, you, like, disappeared, man.
Yeah.
Well, you know, me and college didn't really... you know?
But, hey, worked out for you, right?
So, what the heck are you doing here, man?
Oh, I'm here to save your soul.
Amazing.
Save it from what?
The zombies.
I mean, like, what is this place?
Uh, it's an office.
Maybe you've heard of them.
Yeah, I've heard of them, but I mean, like, what does this office in particular, like, you know, make?
It's a bank.
Oh, it's a bank?
You're a banker?
Uh, no.
No, I'm not.
I'm the...
I'm a social media coordinator.
- Oh, okay.
- It's actually...
It's...
It's actually kind of pretty creative.
Uh...
I get to write on social media using different personas.
Like, different characters almost for different...
Okay, for example.
Right now, we're doing this, um, big Twitter campaign
- for our mortgage division.
- Uh-huh.
Turns out, research says that it's, you know, it's super-hard for millennials to get interested in mortgages because of the economy and stuff.
And so it's my job to, you know, appeal to different demographics.
And, you know...
Hey, you still have the Manifesto?
The what?
The Manifesto, man.
Don't tell me you threw it away.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you remember that.
Remember?
Dude, I am never gonna forget the Manifesto as long as...
Hey, what are you doing Saturday?
Uh, jeez.
Um...
Saturday, I actually think I have to come back in.
My boss...
- No, you're not.
You're coming with me.
- Oh, I wish, man.
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing?
[chuckles] Okay, what are we doing?
[makes muffled noise] [laughs]
Okay.
What does that mean?
Okay.
It means, I got into town this morning, right?
To do this...
I mean, I don't know how to...
I mean, to do this really cool thing.
You know?
And then suddenly, I was like, holy shit.
Kyle.
Kyle!
Kyle lives here.
I miss Kyle.
I need Kyle.
And, you know, I think I can get you in.
And it's gonna be amazing, and we're gonna do it.
[chuckles] We're gonna do what?
We're gonna have, you know, an experience.
[both chuckling]
Oh, no.
[both laughing]
Okay.
Okay.
What kind of experience?
What kind of experience do you want?
Wow.
- Okay.
Um...
- Right?
And when does...?
Or how long does this experience take?
It takes as long you want it to take.
You know what I mean?
No, no, not really.
Well, can you be any less specific?
I cannot.
And I will not say another word until you agree to come.
Oh, man, Zack.
- I missed you, man. [chuckles]
- I missed you, man.
Why couldn't you have given me, like, any notice?
Kyle, I really want you to do this with me.
What if I said it was like a workshop?
Like a motivational workshop?
Wha...?
Okay.
[phone rings]
Social Media, this is Kyle.
Hey, Chad.
- Yeah.
- Okay, you're coming with me, all right?
It's 100 bucks.
I can front you the money...
I mean, I don't have a credit card.
I don't care about the money.
It's...
- [Chad] Yo, Kyle, my man.
- Oh, my...
What about drinks?
Sunday night.
What's your number?
- I don't have a number.
- You don't have a number.
What?
- What do you mean?
You don't...?
- I don't have a number.
- [Chad] Kyle?
- Um...
Okay.
Sit down.
Sit down, all right?
- And I will be right back.
- Okay.
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey, Chad.
Did you...?
- One sec, bud.
You're fucking me.
Oh, you are fucking me.
- Chad?
- Ha-ha!
- You're so fucking me right now, man.
- All right, I got a friend, but...
Stop it.
Fuck you.
[Chad laughing]
[Chad] Fuck you, man.
You're fucking killing me.
What'd she say?
[treadmill beeps] [panting]
What is Rebirth?
[chuckles]
Uh, let me tell you about Rebirth.
I think Rebirth, it's about getting out of your rut.
It's about getting in touch with yourself.
With your body.
[man] We live in a "one life fits all" culture.
And Rebirth dares you to find the life for you.
It's fun.
It's fast.
It's furious.
It's crazy.
It's a blast.
[woman 1] People talk about the high that they get when they climb Everest.
I don't need Everest.
I have Rebirth.
[woman 2] I'm the last person to do something like this.
But Rebirth opened me up to men, to sensuality.
To experimentation.
[woman 3] My first Rebirth, I didn't go with anyone.
I was all by myself.
And so I was really nervous and kind of shy and in my shell.
And by the end, I just felt so much more confident in myself.
And I had had some of the most intense sensual experiences of my life.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- You coming to bed?
- Yeah, in a minute.
- What are you doing?
- Oh.
Uh...
Just looking through this old stuff.
Hey, guess who came to work today out of nowhere.
Zack.
Zack who?
You know, Zack.
From college.
[chuckles] Oh.
That guy?
Was he a student there?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Huh.
- He was wild.
- Yeah, I guess.
So, what'd he want?
Nothing, I mean, you know, he just wanted to say, "What's up?
Hi."
Okay.
Hey, hon?
Hey.
You know how you're always taking these girls' weekends?
[sighs]
Uh...
Excuse me.
Do you know where everybody went?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Hey, honey, it's me.
Listen, I think you were right.
This thing is kind of dumb.
So, I was thinking maybe I could take Jill and...
Uh...
Hold...
I'm sorry, babe.
Let me call you right back, okay?
I'll call you right back.
Love you, bye.
[sighs]
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody in here?
[line rings]
- [woman] 911.
What is your emergency?
- No.
No, thank you.
[beeping] [lock clicks]
What?
[music playing over TV]
[man] For the best outcome, we recommend checking into a hotel the night before, away from the distractions of loved ones.
Set your humidifier to 85 percent.
Remove your clothes.
Relax.
Visualize the events of your life leading to this moment.
Breathe.
Set your alarm a few hours before your shuttle's departure time and practice the series of power poses shown earlier in this video.
[Distorted] Breathe.
[chuckles] What?
You are now centering your intentions for the day's journey and are fully prepared.
[Distorted] Breathe.
Hey.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait.
Oh, come on.
I...
I couldn't find you guys.
Thank you.
Hello?
I, uh...
Excuse me.
Oh!
Excuse me.
Ahem.
Hi.
Oh, well.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, are you going to the Rebirth thing?
I found the clues or whatever. [chuckles]
Up in one of the rooms.
It's pretty cool.
Um...
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, wait!
The deeper you look, the more you see.
Come on.
All right.
Did I get it?
I don't think you're ready to get on this bus.
Oh.
Do you always give up this easy?
No, no, no.
But you said no.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I get on the bus, please?
Sir, may I get on the bus?
I'm getting on the bus.
[chuckles]
Hey.
Ahem.
Oh.
Uh...
And what's that for?
What's that...?
All right.
Are we good?
Uh...
Mind if I squeeze in?
Do you know Zack?
Zack West.
Zachary West?
My friend?
He's...
All right.
Hey.
How's it going?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
So, hey, uh, do you mind if I sit there?
It's the only seat.
Is that your bag?
I'll just...
I'll just hold onto it, all right?
I'll just hold onto it.
Thank you.
Well, this is super-creepy.
Why are the windows covered?
Is everyone done with their forms?
Hold them up like this.
Everyone done?
Please relinquish your cell phones.
Over the next two days, you're about to experience actual person-to-person contact.
Some of you will find this highly disturbing.
Do not worry.
You will be safely re-tethered with the hive mind after the weekend.
We will not make you do anything against your morals.
You are free to leave whenever you want.
Would anybody like me to pull over the bus now and call a cab?
Rebirth is not for everyone.
You can return to the zombie world right now.
No one knows you're here.
And no one will think anything less of you.
Would anyone like to leave?
Good.
Now get your war paint on.
[brakes hiss]
[man 1 over PA] Do not speak.
Do not remove your blindfold.
If you speak, you will be asked to leave.
If you remove your blindfold, you will be asked to leave.
Do not speak.
Do not remove your blindfold.
If you speak, you will be asked to leave.
[man 2] Everybody stop!
...you will be asked to leave.
[alarm blaring]
Do not speak.
Do not... [air hissing] ...you will be asked to leave.
If you remove your blindfold, you will be asked to leave.
[man 2] Proceed!
[man 3 yelling]
[man 4] Shut up!
Put that on, you piece of shit.
[man 3] I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll be good!
[metal detector squeaking] [dog barking]
[man 5] Halt.
Remove your hands from the man in front of you.
Do not speak.
You may now remove your blindfolds.
Welcome to your Rebirth.
Oh... [over speakers] ♪ I said Welcome to your rebirth ♪ [woman vocalizes over speakers] [explosive noise] [hip-hop music playing over speakers] [man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Yeah.
[indistinct chatter] [man 3] Hey, hey, hey.
[man 4] There he is.
[all cheering] [all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
That's nice.
I don't really know what to say, though.
- Just tell the truth, brother.
- [man 5] Yeah.
Okay.
Well, if I must, then...
- Welcome home.
- [man 2] Yeah!
[man 3] Yeah!
I said, welcome the fuck home!
[all cheering]
[whooping]
Two days.
We've got two days to do this.
And then we've gotta go back out there.
Back to their bullshit.
[crowd] Yeah.
[man 6] That's right.
Two days and two rules.
The first rule, the most important rule, the golden rule, the alpha and omega rule, is you can leave any time you want.
[man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Exactly.
- [man 3] Yeah!
- What's rule number two, guys?
[all] No leaders!
Yeah, no leaders, okay?
What's rule number three?
[all] No spoilers!
You can't tell your friends what Rebirth is all about.
Just tell them to get their asses down here.
[man 4] Yeah.
[man 5] Yeah.
Now, the last rule, the platinum rule, the rule to end all rules is what?
[all] No spectators!
Fucking no spectators.
I remember the first time I made it through that hotel into Rebirth.
I thought I was a big deal.
- You know, I own three houses.
- [man 1] Yeah.
I got boats in two different oceans.
I haven't flown coach in four years.
I don't need this Rebirth bullshit.
[crowd] Yeah.
And then I realized.
The man you are before you come to Rebirth doesn't mean jack-fucking-shit!
[all cheering] [man 1] Didn't mean shit.
Out there is just an image you create for the zombie world.
- You don't get to be a zombie in here.
- [man 2] No.
You've gotta murder your inner zombie here.
[all] Yeah!
You've gotta wrap it in plastic and stuff a towel in its mouth
- to shut it the fuck up.
- [all] Yeah!
Then you gotta drive it in a car to a goddamn hole in a desert.
[all cheering]
By the way, how many fetuses do we have here today?
[all laugh]
Newbies, how many new people?
Get your hands up, let's see it.
All right, you guys may have heard some scary things about Rebirth.
Who's heard scary things?
You, what scares you about Rebirth?
Nothing.
[all laugh]
Well, I can't argue with that.
Um, all right, how about... you, big man?
Uh...
Uh...
Nothing.
[man 1] What?
[host] Fuck me.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you really just make the same joke that guy made five seconds ago?
What did we say the most important rule was?
Uh...
- Hello?
- You can leave whenever you want.
All right?
Wasn't that...?
No spectators.
- You know why we say that?
Hello?
- Uh...
Oh.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody home?
- Because, um...
- Because spectators judge.
Right?
They just sit back, they don't take risks.
And they just criticize, criticize, criticize... [blathering]
It's like those pussies on the Internet taking shots at the successful people.
Where are you from, by the way?
- Uh, Minnesota originally.
- Minnesota.
Oh, man, Minnesota.
Minnesota.
Minne-Minne-Minne-Minnesota.
Land of the stoics.
Land of good common sense.
I think Mr. Minnesota thinks he's too good for us.
Are you too good for us, Minnesota?
- No.
- They can't hear you.
- What's your name?
- Kyle.
Kyle.
You think you're too good for us, Kyle?
No, all right?
No. [chuckles]
Yes, you do.
You know how I know?
When I saw you walk in here, everybody else was dancing and letting it all hang out, and you're thinking:
"I'm too cool for this.
Self-help is for losers."
And do you know how I know?
Because I was scared my first time too.
I'm gonna let you off the hook now, Kyle.
How about a big Rebirth round of applause for Kyle?
[all cheering] [all] Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.
That's right.
When I realized what Rebirth demands and the doors it opens,
I was scared as shit.
You know who's really scared?
The zombies.
[man 1] Oh!
[man 2] Boo!
[host] They're scared we're a cult.
How about it?
Are we a cult?
[all] No!
Well, then say it.
Not a cult.
[all] Not a cult.
- Repeat it.
- [all] Not a cult.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
[woman] I think you need to leave.
Not a cult.
[host] That's right.
- I said, I think you need to leave.
- [host] A cult doesn't ask questions.
- A cult gives you answers.
- What?
- Are you talking to me?
- [host] I want you to question everything.
A cult doesn't let you leave.
You don't belong in this room.
[host] We only have this building till manana.
You guys have to leave.
Are you serious?
I...
Because of what he said?
I'm pretty sure he was just using me as an example.
- [host] We're asking, keep this secret.
- I'm cool.
It's cool.
[woman] You need to leave.
[host] You're trusting that you're with people...
- You seriously want me to leave?
- Before I bring up our next guest...
- ...
let's say a few words about...
Fuck it.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- You all know who he is.
Please give a big Rebirth welcome to Jesse.
[all] Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.
[Kyle] Did I do something wrong?
My friend, Zack, signed me up for this.
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
Can I just see if he's here maybe?
Or...?
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing what?
Why did you make me leave?
- I didn't make you leave.
- Are you serious?
You said...
You said, "I think you should leave."
What...?
Oh, come on.
Because, like, you didn't force me to leave, so I should...?
Should I go back?
[chuckles]
Why do you think I asked you to leave?
[chuckles] You said I didn't belong.
So, I don't know, was I not cool enough or...?
Who exactly are you, anyway?
Are you, like, in charge or...?
Why do you think not belonging is such a bad thing?
- Isn't that the whole point?
- Whole point of what?
This.
Of this.
The point of what?
Okay. [chuckles]
Okay, okay, so, is this how this works?
Is this how what works?
Uh... [chuckles]
Is this, like, an exercise?
This whole thing?
- What whole thing?
- Heh.
You're not gonna stop, are you?
Okay, so should I...?
I'll go back to the thing now.
- What thing?
- The thing.
The seminar, dance party, whatev...
The whole reason I'm here.
Okay, okay, I'm going.
So, that's the reason you're here?
Well, I don't know.
Is there something else?
Would you like there to be something else?
I don't know.
What else is there to do?
What would you like to do?
[chuckles]
I've never been to one of these things before.
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you ask me the question you really wanna ask?
Okay, well, what is...?
What question is that?
Why did I single you out?
Okay, okay, why did you single me out?
Why do you think I singled you out?
Because I'm the new guy and you guys wanna do something to me?
Do you wanna do something to me?
No, no.
I don't...
I don't...
I wasn't...
I don't...
I mean, what?
I...
Is that okay with you?
Is it okay with you?
Look, no, no, no, I don't... [chuckles]
I mean, that depends on what you wanna do.
What are we talking about?
What's rule number two?
Oh...
- No leaders?
- What do you think that means?
It means we can... do whatever we want.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, man.
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
I...
I'm terrible at this.
Please just tell me.
Why don't you just say it?
Is it because you don't know?
Or you're afraid that I might judge your answer?
[chuckles]
No...
Would you like to go to the Wish Room?
The what?
What's the Wish Room?
What do you think it is?
[chuckles]
I...
I imagine it's a room where you make a wish and it comes true?
Is that the kind of room that you'd like to go to?
I mean, who wouldn't, right?
I don't know.
Who wouldn't?
So, what you're saying is that I ask you, tell you, to take me to the Wish Room and you'd take me there?
Do you think that's the way this works?
Take me to the Wish Room.
[man over speakers] Relax.
[man speaks in French]
[in English] You're floating away.
Breathe.
Breathe.
[sighs] [man speaks in French]
[door opens]
[in English] You are floating away.
Oh, sorry.
[man speaks in French]
[in English] Surrender to the power of the ocean.
Breathe.
[whale calls playing over speakers]
[woman panting]
What the fuck?
Hey!
[in English] Surrender to the power of the ocean.
[man speaks in French]
[in English] Breathe.
Jesus Christ.
[all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Hello?
Where'd everyone go?
[man 1] Be quiet.
[man 1] We're all good, right?
All good?
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
Uh...
No, no, no.
Come on in, please.
Uh...
No, I...
I...
I...
Welcome.
Join us.
Okay, but I'm a fetus, I guess. [chuckles]
I'm just looking for the big room.
Oh, we have plenty of space in here.
Please, have a seat.
Right.
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
What's your name?
Uh, Kyle.
Kyle.
I'm Air.
- Hi.
- I feel like I knew you were coming.
[chuckles] Did you feel it, too?
Um...
Well... [chuckles]
We're really glad to have you join us.
Join our circle.
Thank you.
Great.
Yeah, me too. [chuckles]
Okay, everyone, relax.
Close your eyes.
Relax.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Feel each other's presence.
There's something else in the room, isn't there?
Does everyone else feel it?
It's floating.
Somewhere... over there.
Over Kyle.
Near the ceiling.
Oh.
It's a wave of pure white light.
Breathe it in.
[Air gasps]
Something's not right.
Something's not right.
I feel like it wants to hurt me.
Like it's inside of me, touching me with it's...
Oh, God, who brought this thing in here?
!
[man] You okay?
- It's okay.
It's okay, what's wrong?
- I'm sorry.
I lost the connection.
I'm so sorry.
I'm trying so hard.
Don't be sorry.
Let's explore that.
When did you lose it?
Mmm.
Well, I think I might know the answer.
You mind if I say it?
Was it when this asshole burst in here like a wet fart?
[Kyle] Wait.
Wha...?
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
It's over, okay?
Come on, come on.
There you go, there you go.
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- I am so sorry.
Why don't you go ahead and have a seat, okay?
There you go.
- Hey, I'm sorry.
I...
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're okay, right, Air?
See?
See?
No one got punched in the face.
All right?
Let's reboot.
Not restart.
It's good.
Okay, so...
How about we try it again?
Yup?
[clears throat]
Kyle?
You wanna give it a shot?
- I don't know what you guys are doing.
- Don't worry, no one's gonna bite.
Stand up.
- Come on, stand up.
- Sorry.
There you go.
[exhaling]
There you go.
Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm...
Yeah.
- Okay.
All right.
Okay, come on.
- All right.
- Sorry.
Go ahead.
What do you want me to do?
Just go for it.
Go ahead and lead us.
Okay, I...
Sorry, I'm not supposed to be here now, so...
You're not supposed to be here now?
Yeah, yeah, no.
I was with the...
Or I missed the end of the orientation, so I think I'm...
Uh, I'm supposed to be, you know...
This is, like, an advanced group, right?
Wow.
Mm.
Someone wanna tell me where the advanced group is?
That sounds pretty cool.
What do they teach in the advanced group?
How to walk through walls and shit?
Okay.
- You want me to leave?
- Why are you asking me?
This is like an exercise, right?
This is like an exercise?
No.
No.
This is reality.
Are you supposed to be here or not?
You tell me.
I've never fucking met you.
Okay.
I'm gonna...
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
Relax, come here.
I'm just fucking with you to make a point, okay?
You are supposed to be here, Kyle.
Please, stay with us. [chuckles]
- You're supposed to be here, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, sit down.
Come on.
Come on, sit down.
You're good, come on.
There you go.
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
That's okay, man.
[grunting]
Oh, what happened?
Someone hit you?
The fuck?
!
Or it's just an exercise.
So, what do you do when someone hits you?
You just take it like that?
Fuck, man, you can't just fucking hit people!
Why not?
Anyone else think their ego trumps the death of the universe?
You can leave any time.
What about you, Spielberg?
You getting enough for your spank reel?
Let me out now!
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Everything was just fine till you showed up.
Wasn't it, gang?
- I don't need this.
- You don't need what?
I don't need whatever bullshit test you're teaching, man.
Don't you fucking listen to anything?
There are no teachers here.
- I'm not gonna hit you, man.
- What?
[chuckles] Why would I want you to hit me?
Is that how you get hard?
You make Daddy spank you?
- Oh, no, what's going on?
No one there?
- God.
Maybe they want you here for a reason.
Why don't you sit the fuck down next to Air and she can tell you more about what angel dicks taste like.
Really nice, guys.
You just let this guy bully you?
They're here to admit that consciousness is a mistake.
- Not take over class on day one.
- Oh, whatever.
Jesus Christ!
You got a seriously fucked up life, man.
I almost felt bad for you.
Cute wife.
You think you were her first choice?
Wow, look at those guys.
Nice polo.
- These guys even alive?
- How did you get these?
"Hey, guys, totally got the hookup from National First on my mortgage.
Hashtag "first time homeowner," hashtag "woot," hashtag "YOLO."
Wow.
Really good to see that $80,000 creative writing MFA isn't going to waste.
How did you get these?
- Is that my phone?
- Technically, until the end of the weekend, it's our phone.
- Give me that back.
- This isn't really a phone, is it?
- This is the key to his prison cell.
- Oh, my fucking God.
Wow.
You see that?
You see how worked up he's getting?
- I believe that's what we call a red flag.
- You stole my phone.
You gave this to total strangers willingly!
This has got your entire life on here, man.
Pictures of your daughter, your wife.
- Fuck.
- Layout of your house.
Home addresses of friends and family.
The passwords of your security systems and bank accounts just saved in your e-mail folder, like an idiot.
You don't even have a passcode on this.
Hey, hey, no...
It's okay.
Dude, it is okay.
I'm as bad as you.
We all are, aren't we?
This?
This is not reality.
None of the shit on here is real.
That's reality.
This is just silicon and air.
Let me out.
- Oh, come on.
It's over, let's be friends.
- I wanna leave right now.
Don't you listen to anything?
You can go any time you want.
There's the door.
Namaste.
All right, everybody take off your clothes.
[groans]
Fucking goddamn it.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck!
[sighs]
[grunting]
- Can we help you?
- [Kyle] How do I get out of here?
Are you feeling all right?
You look a little...
Hey, hey.
Hold on one second.
Are you sure you feel all right?
Just show me how to get out of this dungeon.
Oh.
I think it's this way.
I'm Todd, by the way.
You're Kyle, right?
How do you know my name?
You're the one that Ray picked on in his speech, right?
Hey, don't feel bad about that.
He always tries to throw you off-balance your first time.
- It's sort of an honor.
- Just show me how to get out of here.
Cool, cool.
Yeah, right this way.
Can I just say something, Kyle?
Kyle, if I may.
- Breathe.
- I am.
No, no, really take a second.
You know, calm your body and just breathe.
Breathe?
You want me to breathe?
A guy fucking punched me, threw a chair, broke into my phone.
Wow.
Okay, was he trying to make a point or...?
I don't care.
I know where you're coming from, man.
- Yeah, Rebirth, it's intense.
- Fuck.
I washed out my first three tries.
And it took me four years before I came back.
Lost everything in those four years.
My job, my credit, my house.
My two girls wouldn't even talk to me because I couldn't face the things that Rebirth was trying to get me to confront.
- I don't care.
- Can I just say?
The whole point of Rebirth, basically, is to find what you need, not what you want.
And sometimes, what you need, Kyle, not super-pleasant.
I don't need any of this.
Fair enough, but you know if you walk into a room and it's too heavy for you, you just leave.
That's what you're supposed to do.
See, everybody needs something different, so every room is different, but you gotta keep opening those doors.
He broke into my phone.
And it stays in the room.
Everything stays in the room.
Just show me where the exit is.
I think I know where you were.
Yeah.
Can I just say, it's not gonna get worse than that?
Unless you want it to.
Can I say that?
Is the shuttle out there?
You're already here, man.
It's more interesting than, what, a night of TV?
And don't forget about Zack.
You know Zack?
Of course I know Zack.
I love Zack.
So, Zack is here?
Uh... [groans]
I don't think I can actually say that.
You don't?
It's easy.
He's either here or he's not.
Yes or no.
No, but not no as in he's not here.
No as in...
I can't break the spoiler rule, man.
- Fuck.
- Okay, look.
Look, look, look.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not supposed to find him yet.
And if he were here, theoretically... you will.
Maybe.
[groans]
I wish I could say more.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay.
Off the record.
There are no leaders here, man.
Zack is doing his Rebirth just like everybody else.
Just like everybody else.
And when you're supposed to find him...
I'm gonna take you to a room you're gonna love, okay?
Spoiler curtain down.
You are gonna love it.
Man to man, no cameras, no bullshit.
You're gonna love this room.
Hey, guys.
This is Kyle.
He's a good friend of Zack's.
- [woman] Hi, Kyle.
- I love Zack.
[man] Welcome, Kyle.
I'm Gabriel.
Call me Gabe.
Come.
Join us.
This is Kyle's first Rebirth.
He's feeling a little overwhelmed.
He could really use some unconditional love.
Leave the door open.
Whatever makes you comfortable.
If anybody fucks with me again, I will call 911.
[all chuckle]
Deal.
[Gabe] Mm.
[woman] Mm.
- Welcome.
- Hi.
Okay.
That's all right.
Hi.
[Gabe] Kyle.
This circle is about honesty.
It's about saying whatever's on your mind right now, in the moment.
Okay.
Kyle, I feel like you're really nervous right now.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, yeah.
[Gabe] That's okay, that's okay.
Just tell us what you're thinking at this moment.
Now... be honest.
Okay.
Uh...
I think this whole Rebirth thing is pretty fucked up.
[woman 1] Mm.
[woman 2] Hmm.
[Gabe] Hm.
[all] Mm.
I remember feeling the exact same way.
- I totally empathize.
- Okay, thank you.
Is there something you wanna share with the group?
Nope, nope.
Everything's good.
It's all great.
Everything's great.
Thank you, that's fine.
Thank you.
Carry on.
You know, I don't...
I don't feel like you're being honest.
I don't feel like that, either.
Yeah, well, what do you want?
All we want is honesty.
Now, if you have to say something negative just be honest about it.
Okay.
I think this is a fucking joke.
I think you're all a bunch of arrogant assholes who think you're superior to everyone because... [chuckles]
I don't know, you're so open-minded, it'd be okay if someone shot you in the face?
And I'm fucking pissed I wasted a day I could've spent with my kid doing this hippie bullshit my friend, who I don't even really know is my friend, tricked me into.
And I don't know what this is, but I wouldn't be surprised if you dick-sacks are stealing my identity right now.
And I wanna go home.
Is that honest enough for you, Gabe?
I just wanna say that I'm really connecting to what Kyle is feeling right now.
Me too.
[Gabe] What's making you feel connected to Kyle?
I guess, his honesty about feeling like he doesn't belong, because I was feeling that way, too.
And I'm glad that someone just came in here and called everyone on their bullshit.
[Gabe] Mmm.
Kyle.
How do you feel about that?
Uh, good, I guess.
I'm feeling, like, a lot of anger out of you.
But, like, a lot of life, too,
- and I don't know, um... vitality?
- [Gabe] Mm.
- And I'm kind of really drawn to that.
- [woman 3] Me too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm feeling like this tractor beam of male energy... that I haven't felt anywhere else this weekend.
Can I say something weird?
Just stay in the moment.
I feel like, I go to these kinds of things a lot, and I meet a lot of guys who wanna be here.
But I never meet guys who should be here until now.
And this is probably terrible to say about a first-timer, but...
I probably shouldn't say it.
Just... tell the truth.
When I look at Kyle I see this huge, angry erect cock.
[women chuckling] [all chuckle]
Do you feel threatened by the cock?
How does the cock make you feel?
Happy.
Intrigued.
Okay.
Horny.
[Gabe] Kyle.
How do you feel hearing this?
Uh...
I...
It...
Good.
This...
I mean, it's nice.
Thank you.
- [Gabe] Is that all?
- I, uh...
Um...
I don't know.
Do you feel any shame having these women tell you how they feel about you?
No, no.
No, no, no.
I don't know, I don't know.
Oh, good, good.
Stay with that.
How about you, Betty?
What do you feel about Kyle right now?
I'm starting to feel really turned on.
I just wanna say that I'm feeling this amazing spontaneity in the room right now.
[all chuckle]
I feel like we're all on the same wavelength of breaking through our inhibitions and doing something really crazy, don't you, guys?
[all chuckling]
Do you feel like you're waiting for someone to take the first step?
- Kind of.
- [Gabe] Mm.
Kind of.
Man.
[Gabe] All right.
Now I wanna check back in with Kyle.
Kyle.
Kyle.
How are you feeling?
Do you feel safe?
Uh, heh...
Yeah?
[Gabe] Uh, you know that felt more like a question than an answer.
- Do you still wanna go home?
- Uh...
[Gabe] Hmm?
[man] Hello?
!
[Gabe] Kyle.
What would you like to have happen in this room?
- [man] Hello?
!
- I don't know, I don't...
Not sure.
[man] Hello?
[Gabe] Betty?
[man] Hello?
What do you want Kyle to do right now?
I want Kyle to fuck me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
[man] Please, please.
[Gabe] Kyle, do you wanna do that?
[man] Somebody help me!
Please.
I, uh...
What is...?
- [man] Please, somebody help me!
- Who is that?
What is that?
[man] You fucking sick motherfuckers!
All right, does anybody...?
Do you hear...?
Is that a thing?
Is that part of this?
Why do you think that person is your responsibility?
[man] This is so fucked up!
All right, all right, all right.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
- [woman] I know, right?
- Who is that?
Do you think that man's needs trump your own?
What is this?
Is this part of this?
Is this part of the thing?
You can't return to the same place twice.
[man] I'm being held against my will!
[Kyle] Jesus.
[man] Held against my will!
Anybody.
Anybody, please.
Who is that?
- [man] Can anybody fucking hear me?
- Hello?
What the fuck?
- Hello?
- [man] Oh, God, please!
What the hell is going on?
What do you think is going on?
- [man] Is someone out there?
- Who is that?
- Who do you think it is?
- Stop.
Stop.
- Stop with that shit!
- Stop what?
[man] Anybody, please.
Anybody.
Kyle, please stop.
He's fine.
- Open the door!
- [man] Is someone out there?
Okay, it's not what it looks like.
He knows he can quit any time.
[man] Hello?
!
Hello?
Hello?
Goddamn it, is this real?
!
Okay, the man behind this door is at a very delicate phase of his Rebirth.
- Shut up.
I don't wanna hear it!
- Okay, just stop.
I never told you about my life before Rebirth.
I don't care.
I could tell you I was a drug addict.
I could tell you that my kid was taken away from me.
I could tell you anything, but it doesn't matter.
What matters is I'm not the same person I used to be.
- [man] Please.
- I don't even know your name, lady.
Kyle!
Okay, I know this looks crazy, but he actually needs this.
Jesus, Zack.
- Zack?
- Stop talking to him.
- We need help.
- What are they doing to you?
It's okay.
I don't want you to talk to him.
We're getting help...
- Get out of here!
- It's okay, sweetie...
Shut up!
[grunts]
Okay.
I'm gonna get you down, all right?
Jesus.
Fuck.
Okay.
All right, all right, hold still.
Oh, I can feel your belly.
What the fuck happened to your pants, man?
- Ha-ha-ha!
- What the hell are you laughing at?
God.
What the fuck did they do...?
- Oh, fuck.
- Careful.
One of those buckets is my bathroom.
What?
Hey, did I, like, tell you how much it means to me
- that you came this weekend?
- Put this on.
- Okay?
Put this on.
- Is it time?
Is it T-shirt time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's T-shirt time.
Come on, come on.
Jesus Christ.
What are these, man?
Are these branding marks?
Those are my Rebirths, man.
Come on, come on, come on.
Jesse's trying...
Is helping break my attachments to the domination game.
To, like, the status thing.
You know what I'm saying?
- You're gonna put these pants on.
- No, no, no.
Put the pants on.
Put them on.
You were just screaming for help.
Why not?
[laughing]
No, no, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no.
No.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
[woman] Stop hurting him!
Stop hurting him.
Zack, are you okay?
Where's Jesse?
Is Jesse out there?
Naomi, just...
Could you get Jesse?
- Could you get Jesse?
- Who the fuck is Jesse?
[Naomi] Jesse's coming, honey.
Hang in there.
Okay, thank you, Naomi.
All right, I hope you know that I have called the police, and they are on their way.
[Naomi] No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
- Fuck.
Hey, Kyle, Kyle, I...
- Oh, fuck.
[Zack squeals]
Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop.
What's wrong with you?
It's okay.
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's my supplements.
- Are they drugging you?
- No, no.
Not drugs.
They're supplements.
My God.
You're not gonna hurt Jesse, are you?
- You're not gonna hurt Jesse.
- You're drugging him?
How long have you been with these people?
- Uh...
- Huh?
That I don't...
Because we jump around a lot, you know what I mean?
Because Je...
Have you met Jesse?
Who the fuck is Jesse?
- [Naomi] Jesse's almost here.
- It's okay, it's okay.
Because this is my friend.
This is my best friend, Naomi.
Oh, God.
Wait, wait.
You're not...
Hold on.
I hope the money...
- Is the money...?
Are you mad about...?
- What do you mean?
What money?
[slamming on door]
What money?
Jesse says that money is just a construct, too.
- So, it's fine, it's fine.
- No, no, no.
They didn't make you give them your money.
No, no, no, not my money.
Your money. [chuckles]
What do you mean, my money?
What are you talking about?
What does he mean, my money?
[Naomi] You shouldn't be talking to him right now, asshole.
What do you mean, my money?
What have you done?
- What did you freaks do to my money?
- You're doing it!
What did you do?
What have you done to me?
What did I...?
What...?
[man whistles] [man] Zachariah, are you there?
- Jesse!
- Okay, why are...?
Come on.
- Jesse.
- Aah!
[grunting]
- I come in peace.
- Aah!
No, Kyle, no!
- No!
- Zachariah, stop it.
Your friend can't help it.
He's not a Birthling.
What did we talk about?
Your friend is not a Birthling.
You can't be expecting him to have the insight...
Sir, I believe in a peaceful revolution through massage and the...
Stop it!
Stop with your brainwashing bullshit.
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you.
What the fuck is this, huh?
Cupcakes?
What the fuck is going on?
!
Aah!
- [Zack] Jesse!
Jesse!
- No, no, no.
No, we've seen your friend.
Now we're leaving.
No, no, no.
Let him help you.
Tell me what your body's feeling.
Tell me what your body's feeling.
- Please, please.
- Every cell in your body has been trained by millions of years of evolution to fight, to survive.
What you're feeling now is real life.
Don't you feel it?
[Jesse] You're just not used to such a pure dose.
Your mind's reacting.
Shut up.
My friend was shitting in a bucket, screaming for help!
[Zack] No, no, you're hurting Jesse.
- [Naomi] Knock it down, knock it down.
- That was real.
Do it again.
[banging on door]
- No, no, hit me again, please.
- Do it again.
- Stop it.
- No, hit me.
- Shut up.
- Hit me again.
- [Naomi] Just knock it down!
- Stay out!
- Stay out!
- Knock it down!
Hit me again.
- They're coming!
- Back off, I'll do it.
I'll fucking do it.
Come on, Zack, let's go.
It's okay, it's okay, Kyle, okay?
- We still love you.
- [Jesse] Zack?
Kyle's the master now.
Do what he says.
- [Zack] Okay.
- This is it.
- Can you feel it?
- [laughs] Yes, I can feel it.
Shut up!
Back off.
Zack, let's go, move.
All right, everybody back off, or I will kill him!
Do it, man.
Do it.
Shut up, man!
- Go, go.
Get back, get back.
- Okay, okay, no one's gonna get hurt.
- Kill me now, master.
I'm ready to ascend.
- That's enough, Jesse.
Stop it.
[laughing]
I think we got a situation here.
You need to kill that footage now.
Go.
[Kyle] Where do we go?
Do we go down?
Where the fuck do we go?
Zack!
[Naomi] We got a breach!
Breach!
[Naomi] Okay, Zack, I need to know what you've told him.
Don't talk to her, Zack, all right?
He didn't tell me nothing, okay?
We just wanna get on that shuttle and go home.
Where the fuck is the exit?
!
Sir, sir, you know this is not real, right?
- Shut up, shut up.
- Okay, all right, what's your name?
- What's his name?
- Kyle-something.
- This guy is having a psychotic episode.
- Yeah, no shit.
- Can we get a doctor over here, please?
- Yeah.
[Kyle] How do you get out of here?
Hey, honey, the exit is this way, where it's always been.
Found a doctor.
Okay, sir, can we just stop moving for a second?
[Naomi] Okay, everyone.
Just stay calm.
[doctor] Sir, what's your name?
- What's his name?
- Kyle.
- It's Kyle.
- [doctor] Okay, Karl.
I'm a psychiatrist at First Memorial.
I'm here for the seminar, like you.
You just tell him to stop whatever the fuck he's trying to do.
- Just let us go, all right?
- No...
No problem.
Some people's brains have a hard time adjusting to Rebirth.
So, just breathe.
They're trying to lock you back in their cage, master.
- Don't listen to them.
- [Naomi] Shut up, Jesse.
- [man 1] I think he went to the Wish Room.
- Yes, he did.
I took him there.
- [man 1] Jesus Christ.
- That's it.
That's the door.
- That's the door.
- Are you sure?
- Stand back, stand back.
- [man 2] Stay.
- Easy.
- Open the door, Zack.
Get over here and open the fucking door.
- It's locked.
- [doctor] Listen.
If you go back into the real world without decompressing, you're gonna have a serious brain damage...
- [Kyle] Shut up!
- It's not a door.
It's a wall.
It's a window, open it.
Shut up!
Everyone shut up and just let me think!
[panting]
[Kyle grunting] [panting]
No.
Hey, Karl, Karl, don't do it, man.
Karl, don't do it, man.
Don't do something you're gonna regret.
- [man] Come back home.
- It's a stupid thing to do.
It's a stupid thing to do.
- Karl, don't do it...
- Shut up!
Nobody fucking move.
Zack.
Let's go.
Zack, let's go.
All right, move.
[Kyle] Hello?
Hello?
!
Hello?
!
Oh, my God.
I'm so fucking hard right now.
God, fuck.
[gasping]
[Kyle panting] [gasping]
Zack!
[all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Aah!
Zack!
Zack!
[yelling]
[all cheering] [yelling]
[gasps] [speaking indistinctly]
It's okay, really.
- What's going on?
- That's not funny.
What the fuck is going on?
Told you, man.
Zack!
Welcome home, brother. [laughing] [all chanting] Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
No, no, no!
Zack!
Zack!

[all cheering]
Zack?
Zack?
Zack?
Yeah!
[all] Yeah!
Whoo!
[all] Whoo!
Oh, shit, man. [laughing]
Hey, everybody.
Let's show my boy Kyle some Rebirth love.
[all cheering]
- What...?
- What do you think, man?
What do you think?
You think they like you?
[chuckles] [all laugh]
Hey, what some of you may not know...
What some of you may not know is that this man is like a brother to me.
And what you may also not know, is that this guy right here, is one of the main inspirations for all of this.
Huh?
[whooping and cheering]
- Whoo!
- [all] Yeah!
That's the man.
That's it.
Huh?
[man 1] Yeah!
[man 2] Yeah!
And you know what else?
I think this motherfucker just made Phase 2 in record time.
[all laugh]
- Right here, Phase Two.
- What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Yeah.
[man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Right?
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What's that, brother?
What?
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, man.
You just Rebirthed, you know?
You just Rebirthed.
That's a rush.
It's a rush.
It's just adrenaline.
It's just adrenaline.
Here, tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
- Tell the camera.
- No, no.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Don't fucking touch me.
Don't fucking touch me!
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Ease off.
Hey, hey, hey.
Kyle, this is the best part.
Hey, man.
It's over.
It's over, man.
- Don't touch me.
- [man] Kyle.
Kyle.
- Don't touch me.
- This is the best part.
Hey, let's get Kyle back, everybody.
- Kyle!
Kyle!
- [all] Kyle!
Kyle!
[all chanting] Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
[birds chirping]
Hey, man.
Kyle.
Kyle, hey.
Kyle, come on, give me a chance...
Let me expl...
It's over, man.
- Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Okay, all right, okay, no problem.
Take me to my car or I call the police.
[Zack] Kyle.
Nothing was ever gonna happen.
Nobody was gonna get...
Jesse's a stuntman.
He's, like, a black belt.
I did this...
I thought...
I thought you would dig it.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I don't wanna talk to this guy.
Can you shut the door?
- Can you shut the door?
- Are you coming on, sir?
No, he's not.
He's not.
Mary?
[line ringing]
[sighs]
Uh...
I'm done.
I'm done.
It's over.
Hey, where are you guys now?
[Mary] We're coming back from swim practice.
We're almost home.
Right.
Uh...
- Right.
Okay.
- Okay, bye.
[sighs] [cell phone dings]
No.
No.
No.
[line ringing]
Fuck.

Hey, there's my guy.
Got a towel, man?
Jesus, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
[grunts] Man, you know, after one of these weekends, it feels, like, a tour in Kabul, man.
I need me, like, a nice hot soak.
My wife is coming home.
This is my house!
I know.
It's nice, man.
Really digging the Jacuzzi.
No towel?
[whistles]
- Hey, guy, you need any help with that?
- What have you done?
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're not finished.
Fuck you.
This, this is over.
Come on.
There's an after party at Jesse's.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God is right.
I mean, those sheets are amazing.
- What's the thread count on those?
- Mary is gonna be home.
Any second.
What else did you do?
I didn't do anything.
I've been in the bath the whole time.
Hey, man, do you mind if I put some tunes on?
I already guessed the Wi-Fi password was "Mumford." Heh.
[groans]
- Check it out, dude, you made the cover.
- Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Just stop.
Stop it.
Stop!
Why are you trying to destroy my life?
I'm not trying to destroy your life, man.
I'm trying to save your life.
I'm here to help you.
I don't want your help!
Oh, fuck!
What do you people want from me?
We want you to stop living your life like a spectator, okay?
[sobs]
That's it?
You all done?
All out of fight?
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Fuck the man.
Keep it real.
Don't be boring.
- What?
What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you!
I'm talking about your dogma, dude.
The Manifesto?
Your words?
Do they mean anything to you anymore?
Oh, my God.
You mean, do I believe in a thing we wrote as a joke when we were 20 years old on shrooms?
[chuckles]
Yeah.
It wasn't a joke.
And you know it.
Stop.
Stop it, all right?
Just stop.
Just tell me what you want before Mary comes home.
I wanna help.
- You're destroying my life!
- You're destroying your life!
You're destroying it!
You sit all day at a job you fucking hate.
You bilk young kids out of money, so they're so immersed in debt that they're enslaved to the system for the rest of their fucking lives.
You can't get a boner, dude.
And you know what the worst part is?
You're really boring.
You're a child.
I'm not 20 anymore.
Thank you.
I know.
I am a child.
So, that way, I can see the world for what it really is, unlike the way the zombies have conditioned you to see it.
The zombies?
I'm an adult.
I have a family.
It's a fucking job!
Right, and I bet the only way to keep your child from starving is lying for a bank!
You have this juvenile obsession with what?
Am I the guy who created this system you hate...?
I don't give a fuck about the system, okay?
I care about you.
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Yeah.
- I can tell.
- Not this you, okay?
Not this you.
The you you used to be.
- Before the fucking lobotomy.
- I like my life.
Oh, do you like your life?
I like my life.
You should fucking love your life, Kyle.
You should've seen your eyes.
You should've seen your eyes when I described this weekend to you.
It was like I was offering you, like, a drop of water and you were just dying of thirst.
No.
I didn't know what it was.
It was called Rebirth!
What'd you think that meant, huh?
It means being born again.
It means a new life.
And that also, Kyle, means killing the old one, you understand?
This is also why we had to drain your savings account.
No, no, no.
That was not real.
That was a fake site.
Mm.
It was real.
It's all real.
[car horn honking]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Just relax.
Relax.
Relax.
- Oh, my God.
Nothing is gonna happen, Kyle, okay?
I'm gonna set you free.
All right, what do you want?
How do I make this stop, all right?
What do you want from me?
What do I want from you?
What do you want from you?
I want the same thing.
I want you to reach enlightenment.
Yes.
Okay, I'll do anything you want.
Just don't do this to my family.
Okay, in order for it to stop...
Right?
You have to tell me that you felt something at Rebirth.
Yes, yes, yes, I felt something.
- Okay, good.
What'd you feel?
- Uh...
I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?
- No, no, it has to be in your own words.
- Oh, fuck.
Just tell me what you wanna hear.
Okay, close your eyes.
Just close your eyes and tell me the truth, brother.
[panting]
- I felt scared, all right?
- Good, good, good.
- I felt like I was gonna die.
- Great.
I feel like I've been through a fucking war.
Yes. [laughs] [smooches]
That's all I wanted to hear.
That's it. [laughs]
- That's it?
That's it?
That's it?
- Yeah, man.
You've seen the other side.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- You can go back to your desk and tweet, twat, whatever the fuck you've been doing for the rest of your life.
But nobody, nobody's gonna take the moment away from you when you held a knife to a cult leader's throat and busted your way out of a sex dungeon.
[both laughing]
- Huh?
- Right.
Right.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And the sex dungeon part.
- That's over, too, right?
- It's over.
I promise.
- [Mary] Hello.
- Hey, we're in here.
I promise, man.
Okay?
You just gotta make a little donation.
[gasps]
Zack.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.
[Zack] Oh, man.
Is this crazy or what?
- Oh, boy.
[Mary] So crazy.
Wow.
Look at you.
Oh, man, you look amazing.
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha.
- You guys look sweaty.
- Oh, yeah.
We're guys.
- How long's it been?
- I don't know.
I mean, long enough for you two lovebirds to have a little one, right?
- Right.
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, Jill, come meet Mom and Dad's friend.
No, no, no, wait.
No, no, no.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Zack was just about to leave.
- Whoa.
No, no, no, I'm dying to meet her.
- Yay.
Let me get her.
- Great.
Wow, she's looking good, man.
- What do you mean, a donation?
You know, a meaningful donation.
I mean, we are a non-profit.
- Like money?
- Yeah, money's good.
- How much money?
- Some money from your bank would be nice.
I don't have access to my bank's money.
Oh, sure you do.
I write tweets to idiots who follow a bank on Twitter.
- I don't have acc...
- All you gotta do is log on to your bank's server from your computer, okay?
The algorithm will do the rest.
- What algorithm?
- Don't worry about it.
Her Highness is on her way down.
[chuckles]
Hey, so, I watched some of the videos from Rebirth.
What?
Just the ones that you e-mailed me.
What?
E-mailed?
Yeah, with the testimonials or whatever.
It actually looked kind of intriguing.
- You're not supposed to do that.
- Oh, no.
No, no, it's okay.
Hey, hey, look, as long as we're breaking the rules here,
- I have some video of your boy.
- Oh!
- No, no, no.
- Wait, I wanna see it.
It's...
It's embarrassing, really.
Right, and you can't share the weekend with outsiders.
Oh, wow.
- It already sounds like a cult.
- No, it's not a cult.
[both laugh]
I hear Kyle says that you guys go to a church.
[Mary] Yeah, we do.
- Yeah?
Oh, I mean, you guys should like...
I mean, you should come.
You know, they like people from, like, all different kinds
- of, you know, spiritual paths.
- She's not interested.
Actually, I don't know.
If you guys both really liked it,
- I'd be open-minded about it.
- She's not interested.
She's not gonna do it, okay?
Just leave us alone.
Kyle.
I think it's time you should leave.
Are you sure?
[Jill] Hey.
[Kyle] Hey.
Hey.
Hey, sweetie!
Jill, this is Zack.
Hi, Jill, it's so nice to meet you.
You are as beautiful as your mother. [laughs]
Hey.
Does anybody want any Kool-Aid?
There's still plenty left over from the seminar.
Huh?
- Sure, that'd be good.
- Yeah.
I know when I was a kid, I loved Kool-Aid.
Kids still like Kool-Aid, don't they, Jill?
- Okay.
- Yummy.
- Hey, she's not thirsty.
- Kyle, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'll do it, okay?
- I'll do it.
- Okay.
[Mary] Kyle, what's going on here?
No, this is...
This is over, all right?
All right, I'll do it.
Um...
I think Kyle had kind of an intense day, and I think he just needs a little decompression time.
Oh.
Uh...
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I was...
- No, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's not a big deal, okay?
Just stop talking.
All right.
Well, how about us guys take a little retreat to the man cave?
If that's okay with you young ladies?
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?
Okay.
Well, fantastic, let's do it, bud.
[Kyle] It's all right.
[Jill] Bye.
So nice to meet you.
[Kyle exhales]
[Zack] Hey.
So, Naomi's gonna shoot a little testimonial video, if that's okay with you.
So, I wanna be clear.
I'm not going to get in trouble, right?
Of course not.
You're my friend.
Are you sure?
We will never take enough to get detected, okay?
I promise.
This is a good thing, Kyle.
You have an insane amount of potential.
You're gonna be an integral part of this community.
You're gonna run our new Media and Communications Department.
You're gonna help us reach a whole new group of people.
Help us make this something really big.
Help me, Kyle.
Help us.
Help yourself. [chuckles]
Have some fun for once in your life.
I mean, the worst case scenario is you make a ton of money.
Dude, I guarantee you, in five years, you're gonna think this is the greatest thing that ever happened to you.
And... if you don't you can leave any time you want.
[Kyle] You know, before I found Rebirth, I was lost.
I really was.
And the worst thing was I didn't know I was lost.
I was bottled up, and it would come out in the dumbest ways.
Just basic stuff, like getting impatient with my wife, or spending all day long looking at my phone, and then getting mad in traffic.
[Mary] Kyle was a great husband, a great father, a great provider.
Um, but he just...
He wasn't happy.
And it affected all of us.
I was living this default life that everyone around me assumed was the best life possible.
But it just wasn't making me happy.
And then I found Rebirth.
Hi, my name is Kyle Madison, and I wanna tell you my Rebirth story.
Oh, yeah.
I remember Kyle's first time at Rebirth.
He was like...
You know, he was like, "What the hell did I just get myself involved in?"
[Jesse] It was almost like watching a game show where you already know that the contestant's won a million dollars, but they don't know yet.
Kyle.
His first time, you know, he was so sweet.
He was so open and fragile.
I just wanted to give him a massive Rebirth hug and be his mommy.
Everyone who was there was like, "Yup, scared that one off." [laughing]
I mean, I honestly never thought I was gonna see this guy ever again.
[sighs]
Hi, my name's Kyle Madison, and I just finished my first Rebirth.
Is that all right?
[man] The next weekend, he comes back.
So, I'm like, "Okay."
Weekend after that, we were in Cincinnati and Kyle flies in.
And, you know, that was it, that's when I knew that this guy was totally hooked.
I mean, his Z.W. potentials just exploded.
Kyle had been on my team for, like, five years, I think.
But he was one of those guys who's always in the back.
A nice guy, but never really initiated, you know?
Uh, but then, one Monday morning, he came in, and it was like bam!
You know?
[laughs]
Who is this guy?
Suddenly, I had Mark Zuckerberg working for me, you know?
- Kyle's the man.
- The man's a god.
It just brings clarity.
That's all.
There's the world before Rebirth and the world after.
Everything unimportant just falls away.
You look at the world and you just see reality.
Just like that.
He's killing everyone with his perspectives.
Just murdering them.
And finally, I was like, "Hey, what's the secret?" You know?
And he looks at me, and he says, "What are you doing this weekend?"
Give it up for Chad!
[all cheering] [laughing]
Right?
I knew he'd love it.
Pretty soon, the whole team loved it.
Then the whole company loved it.
[chuckles]
We're basically the Rebirth branch of Wall Street now.
What Rebirth did for me was...
It didn't just show me how to escape the cage I'd built around myself it actually showed me that the cage existed in the first place.
[Kyle] The first time my wife did her own Rebirth,
I was a little nervous, I'll admit.
[chuckles] But that's because I was clutching on to these zombie ideas of control, mastery and conditioned attachments.
And what you learn is your marriage only hits the stratosphere when you're both free to fly.
What people don't realize is Rebirth is not just something you do one weekend a month.
It's a lifestyle.
Right, Jill?
We want our friends to do it.
We want our parents to do it.
Our nanny, our neighbors.
We definitely want our pastor to do it.
[Mary] I want my brother to do it.
- I want my mailman to do it.
- [Kyle] Ha-ha-ha.
I couldn't wait to get our kids to do it.
Sometimes you're there to help a couple fetuses burst out of the womb and find the warrior within.
Sometimes, you think you're there to deliver the fetus, only to find out you're the fetus and they're there for you.
It's like every time you go to Rebirth, you're a different person.
So every Rebirth's different.
You never know what you're gonna find behind a new open door.
It's not just the workshops.
It's not just the Phase Two Life Activation Experience.
It's also the products.
[Mary] We don't even use the word "sell" in Rebirth.
Because once you realize how much better Rebirth's products are than what you get in the store, it just...
It sells itself.
[Kyle] It's healthy.
It's natural.
It's good.
None of this processed crap.
[Mary] Jill is at an age where she's so picky about what she eats and she loves the stuff.
I don't know what they put in it.
- Tell them your first Rebirth, babe.
- Oh, yeah.
[Kyle] Heh.
You weren't breathing properly.
You can breathe with your nose, you can breathe with your mouth.
But there are other ways to breathe.
Everybody knows there are no leaders at Rebirth, because only you can change your life.
But... [chuckling]
But we all know who that spark was.
[crowd cheering]
Zack 110 percent changed Kyle's life.
And mine too.
In the old days, people were afraid something horrible would happen to them.
Now they're afraid nothing will happen to them.
If Zack hadn't come into my life when he did...
I really don't like to think about it.
I really don't.
[Mary] Zack is just one of those magical beings who can walk up to a stranger, look her in the eye and just immediately knows her deepest, most intimate needs.
Zack was like a brother to me and now that we share Rebirth, he's like a big brother. [chuckles]
- He's the big brother to us all.
- Yeah.
[cheering]
You know, when I started Rebirth in my garage, you know, building it out one weekend at a time to the global force for good that it is today that was the easy part.
You know?
Why I get out of bed every morning is knowing that there's other Kyles out there.
You know what I mean?
You see him at the grocery store.
See him at the gas station.
The drugstore.
[grunting]
Right?
See him on the highway. [whistles]
Going to work.
Going home.
Going to work.
Going home, you know?
Doing the Z.B. Zombie Boogie.
But if you look him them the eye, man, you'll see that they're dying, dying for something better.
They know it's out there.
They just don't know what it is, you know?
So, let's bring him up here.
Kyle Madison, everybody.
Come on, man.
[Zack] Sometimes, uh, I feel like a hunter. [chuckles] [laughing]
I got my gun, I got my bush hat on, and I'm stalking through the suburban savannah, searching for my prey and it's my job never to sleep, okay?
It's my job never to take a break, never to stop, man, until I share this with each and every Kyle.
It's an obligation.
It's a duty.
Whew. [chuckles]
Oh, man.
That's what gets me going.
Hmm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That's what Rebirth means to me.
[crowd cheering and whistling]
[all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
The losses on the value of your 401s or IRAs in the last few years.
Uh-oh.
Looks like the interns are slacking off again.
Hey, Kyle.
What's up?
The gunman was described as a loner...
I'm right behind you.
Jill, let's go.
It's time for school.
Hi, stranger.
Bye.
Have fun.
Come on.
Bye.
So, any big plans this weekend?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Oh, man.
Fuck you, man.
- Oh, fuck.
- Chad?
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
That's so fucked up.
- Are you Kyle?
- Yeah.
Hi.
The front desk says your wife is here.
Some kind of emergency.
Oh, uh, thank you.
Hi.
Hey, excuse me.
Did my...?
Is my wife here?
My name's Kyle Madison.
Her name's Mary.
She said there might be some...
- I'm right here.
It's okay.
- Jesus!
Wait.
What the fuck, ma...?
Oh, my God.
What?
Zack?
- Kyle?
- What?
Come here, brother.
- What are you doing?
How are you?
- Oh, Jesus.
- Look at that.
Fresh-faced.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Wow.
This is crazy timing.
Apparently my wife is here
- with some kind of emergency...
- Emergency.
- Okay.
Wow.
- Okay.
- Right?
Come on, I got you out of school.
- Okay.
- Let's go play.
- Oh, Jesus.
No, man, I...
Can you hang out in my office for like ten, 20, 30 minutes?
- I can do ten, 20.
- Okay, come on.
So, how have you been?
What happened to you?
Uh, you know, I've...
I've been.
I mean, you, like, disappeared, man.
Yeah.
Well, you know, me and college didn't really... you know?
But, hey, worked out for you, right?
So, what the heck are you doing here, man?
Oh, I'm here to save your soul.
Amazing.
Save it from what?
The zombies.
I mean, like, what is this place?
Uh, it's an office.
Maybe you've heard of them.
Yeah, I've heard of them, but I mean, like, what does this office in particular, like, you know, make?
It's a bank.
Oh, it's a bank?
You're a banker?
Uh, no.
No, I'm not.
I'm the...
I'm a social media coordinator.
- Oh, okay.
- It's actually...
It's...
It's actually kind of pretty creative.
Uh...
I get to write on social media using different personas.
Like, different characters almost for different...
Okay, for example.
Right now, we're doing this, um, big Twitter campaign
- for our mortgage division.
- Uh-huh.
Turns out, research says that it's, you know, it's super-hard for millennials to get interested in mortgages because of the economy and stuff.
And so it's my job to, you know, appeal to different demographics.
And, you know...
Hey, you still have the Manifesto?
The what?
The Manifesto, man.
Don't tell me you threw it away.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you remember that.
Remember?
Dude, I am never gonna forget the Manifesto as long as...
Hey, what are you doing Saturday?
Uh, jeez.
Um...
Saturday, I actually think I have to come back in.
My boss...
- No, you're not.
You're coming with me.
- Oh, I wish, man.
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing?
Okay, what are we doing?
Okay.
What does that mean?
Okay.
It means, I got into town this morning, right?
To do this...
I mean, I don't know how to...
I mean, to do this really cool thing.
You know?
And then suddenly, I was like, holy shit.
Kyle.
Kyle!
Kyle lives here.
I miss Kyle.
I need Kyle.
And, you know, I think I can get you in.
And it's gonna be amazing, and we're gonna do it.
We're gonna do what?
We're gonna have, you know, an experience.
Oh, no.
Okay.
Okay.
What kind of experience?
What kind of experience do you want?
Wow.
- Okay.
Um...
- Right?
And when does...?
Or how long does this experience take?
It takes as long you want it to take.
You know what I mean?
No, no, not really.
Well, can you be any less specific?
I cannot.
And I will not say another word until you agree to come.
Oh, man, Zack.
- I missed you, man.
- I missed you, man.
Why couldn't you have given me, like, any notice?
Kyle, I really want you to do this with me.
What if I said it was like a workshop?
Like a motivational workshop?
Wha...?
Okay.
Social Media, this is Kyle.
Hey, Chad.
- Yeah.
- Okay, you're coming with me, all right?
It's 100 bucks.
I can front you the money...
I mean, I don't have a credit card.
I don't care about the money.
It's...
- Yo, Kyle, my man.
- Oh, my...
What about drinks?
Sunday night.
What's your number?
- I don't have a number.
- You don't have a number.
What?
- What do you mean?
You don't...?
- I don't have a number.
- Kyle?
- Um...
Okay.
Sit down.
Sit down, all right?
- And I will be right back.
- Okay.
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey, Chad.
Did you...?
- One sec, bud.
You're fucking me.
Oh, you are fucking me.
- Chad?
- Ha-ha!
- You're so fucking me right now, man.
- All right, I got a friend, but...
Stop it.
Fuck you.
Fuck you, man.
You're fucking killing me.
What'd she say?
What is Rebirth?
Uh, let me tell you about Rebirth.
I think Rebirth, it's about getting out of your rut.
It's about getting in touch with yourself.
With your body.
We live in a "one life fits all" culture.
And Rebirth dares you to find the life for you.
It's fun.
It's fast.
It's furious.
It's crazy.
It's a blast.
People talk about the high that they get when they climb Everest.
I don't need Everest.
I have Rebirth.
I'm the last person to do something like this.
But Rebirth opened me up to men, to sensuality.
To experimentation.
My first Rebirth, I didn't go with anyone.
I was all by myself.
And so I was really nervous and kind of shy and in my shell.
And by the end, I just felt so much more confident in myself.
And I had had some of the most intense sensual experiences of my life.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- You coming to bed?
- Yeah, in a minute.
- What are you doing?
- Oh.
Uh...
Just looking through this old stuff.
Hey, guess who came to work today out of nowhere.
Zack.
Zack who?
You know, Zack.
From college.
Oh.
That guy?
Was he a student there?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Huh.
- He was wild.
- Yeah, I guess.
So, what'd he want?
Nothing, I mean, you know, he just wanted to say, "What's up?
Hi."
Okay.
Hey, hon?
Hey.
You know how you're always taking these girls' weekends?
Uh...
Excuse me.
Do you know where everybody went?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Hey, honey, it's me.
Listen, I think you were right.
This thing is kind of dumb.
So, I was thinking maybe I could take Jill and...
Uh...
Hold...
I'm sorry, babe.
Let me call you right back, okay?
I'll call you right back.
Love you, bye.
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody in here?
- 911.
What is your emergency?
- No.
No, thank you.
What?
For the best outcome, we recommend checking into a hotel the night before, away from the distractions of loved ones.
Set your humidifier to 85 percent.
Remove your clothes.
Relax.
Visualize the events of your life leading to this moment.
Breathe.
Set your alarm a few hours before your shuttle's departure time and practice the series of power poses shown earlier in this video.
Breathe.
What?
You are now centering your intentions for the day's journey and are fully prepared.
Breathe.
Hey.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait.
Oh, come on.
I...
I couldn't find you guys.
Thank you.
Hello?
I, uh...
Excuse me.
Oh!
Excuse me.
Ahem.
Hi.
Oh, well.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, are you going to the Rebirth thing?
I found the clues or whatever.
Up in one of the rooms.
It's pretty cool.
Um...
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, wait!
The deeper you look, the more you see.
Come on.
All right.
Did I get it?
I don't think you're ready to get on this bus.
Oh.
Do you always give up this easy?
No, no, no.
But you said no.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I get on the bus, please?
Sir, may I get on the bus?
I'm getting on the bus.
Hey.
Ahem.
Oh.
Uh...
And what's that for?
What's that...?
All right.
Are we good?
Uh...
Mind if I squeeze in?
Do you know Zack?
Zack West.
Zachary West?
My friend?
He's...
All right.
Hey.
How's it going?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
So, hey, uh, do you mind if I sit there?
It's the only seat.
Is that your bag?
I'll just...
I'll just hold onto it, all right?
I'll just hold onto it.
Thank you.
Well, this is super-creepy.
Why are the windows covered?
Is everyone done with their forms?
Hold them up like this.
Everyone done?
Please relinquish your cell phones.
Over the next two days, you're about to experience actual person-to-person contact.
Some of you will find this highly disturbing.
Do not worry.
You will be safely re-tethered with the hive mind after the weekend.
We will not make you do anything against your morals.
You are free to leave whenever you want.
Would anybody like me to pull over the bus now and call a cab?
Rebirth is not for everyone.
You can return to the zombie world right now.
No one knows you're here.
And no one will think anything less of you.
Would anyone like to leave?
Good.
Now get your war paint on.
Do not speak.
Do not remove your blindfold.
If you speak, you will be asked to leave.
If you remove your blindfold, you will be asked to leave.
Do not speak.
Do not remove your blindfold.
If you speak, you will be asked to leave.
Everybody stop!
...you will be asked to leave.
Do not speak.
Do not you will be asked to leave.
If you remove your blindfold, you will be asked to leave.
Proceed!
Shut up!
Put that on, you piece of shit.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll be good!
Halt.
Remove your hands from the man in front of you.
Do not speak.
You may now remove your blindfolds.
Welcome to your Rebirth.
Oh... ♪ I said Welcome to your rebirth ♪
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
There he is.
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
That's nice.
I don't really know what to say, though.
- Just tell the truth, brother.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, if I must, then...
- Welcome home.
- Yeah!
Yeah!
I said, welcome the fuck home!
Two days.
We've got two days to do this.
And then we've gotta go back out there.
Back to their bullshit.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
Two days and two rules.
The first rule, the most important rule, the golden rule, the alpha and omega rule, is you can leave any time you want.
- Yeah.
- Exactly.
- Yeah!
- What's rule number two, guys?
No leaders!
Yeah, no leaders, okay?
What's rule number three?
No spoilers!
You can't tell your friends what Rebirth is all about.
Just tell them to get their asses down here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Now, the last rule, the platinum rule, the rule to end all rules is what?
No spectators!
Fucking no spectators.
I remember the first time I made it through that hotel into Rebirth.
I thought I was a big deal.
- You know, I own three houses.
- Yeah.
I got boats in two different oceans.
I haven't flown coach in four years.
I don't need this Rebirth bullshit.
Yeah.
And then I realized.
The man you are before you come to Rebirth doesn't mean jack-fucking-shit!
Didn't mean shit.
Out there is just an image you create for the zombie world.
- You don't get to be a zombie in here.
- No.
You've gotta murder your inner zombie here.
Yeah!
You've gotta wrap it in plastic and stuff a towel in its mouth
- to shut it the fuck up.
- Yeah!
Then you gotta drive it in a car to a goddamn hole in a desert.
By the way, how many fetuses do we have here today?
Newbies, how many new people?
Get your hands up, let's see it.
All right, you guys may have heard some scary things about Rebirth.
Who's heard scary things?
You, what scares you about Rebirth?
Nothing.
Well, I can't argue with that.
Um, all right, how about... you, big man?
Uh...
Uh...
Nothing.
What?
Fuck me.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you really just make the same joke that guy made five seconds ago?
What did we say the most important rule was?
Uh...
- Hello?
- You can leave whenever you want.
All right?
Wasn't that...?
No spectators.
- You know why we say that?
Hello?
- Uh...
Oh.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody home?
- Because, um...
- Because spectators judge.
Right?
They just sit back, they don't take risks.
And they just criticize, criticize, criticize...
It's like those pussies on the Internet taking shots at the successful people.
Where are you from, by the way?
- Uh, Minnesota originally.
- Minnesota.
Oh, man, Minnesota.
Minnesota.
Minne-Minne-Minne-Minnesota.
Land of the stoics.
Land of good common sense.
I think Mr. Minnesota thinks he's too good for us.
Are you too good for us, Minnesota?
- No.
- They can't hear you.
- What's your name?
- Kyle.
Kyle.
You think you're too good for us, Kyle?
No, all right?
No.
Yes, you do.
You know how I know?
When I saw you walk in here, everybody else was dancing and letting it all hang out, and you're thinking:
"I'm too cool for this.
Self-help is for losers."
And do you know how I know?
Because I was scared my first time too.
I'm gonna let you off the hook now, Kyle.
How about a big Rebirth round of applause for Kyle?
Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.
That's right.
When I realized what Rebirth demands and the doors it opens,
I was scared as shit.
You know who's really scared?
The zombies.
- Oh!
- Boo!
They're scared we're a cult.
How about it?
Are we a cult?
No!
Well, then say it.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
- Repeat it.
- Not a cult.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
I think you need to leave.
Not a cult.
That's right.
- I said, I think you need to leave.
- A cult doesn't ask questions.
- A cult gives you answers.
- What?
- Are you talking to me?
- I want you to question everything.
A cult doesn't let you leave.
You don't belong in this room.
We only have this building till manana.
You guys have to leave.
Are you serious?
I...
Because of what he said?
I'm pretty sure he was just using me as an example.
- We're asking, keep this secret.
- I'm cool.
It's cool.
You need to leave.
You're trusting that you're with people...
- You seriously want me to leave?
- Before I bring up our next guest...
- ...
let's say a few words about...
Fuck it.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- You all know who he is.
Please give a big Rebirth welcome to Jesse.
Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.
Did I do something wrong?
My friend, Zack, signed me up for this.
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
Can I just see if he's here maybe?
Or...?
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing what?
Why did you make me leave?
- I didn't make you leave.
- Are you serious?
You said...
You said, "I think you should leave."
What...?
Oh, come on.
Because, like, you didn't force me to leave, so I should...?
Should I go back?
Why do you think I asked you to leave?
You said I didn't belong.
So, I don't know, was I not cool enough or...?
Who exactly are you, anyway?
Are you, like, in charge or...?
Why do you think not belonging is such a bad thing?
- Isn't that the whole point?
- Whole point of what?
This.
Of this.
The point of what?
Okay.
Okay, okay, so, is this how this works?
Is this how what works?
Uh...
Is this, like, an exercise?
This whole thing?
- What whole thing?
- Heh.
You're not gonna stop, are you?
Okay, so should I...?
I'll go back to the thing now.
- What thing?
- The thing.
The seminar, dance party, whatev...
The whole reason I'm here.
Okay, okay, I'm going.
So, that's the reason you're here?
Well, I don't know.
Is there something else?
Would you like there to be something else?
I don't know.
What else is there to do?
What would you like to do?
I've never been to one of these things before.
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you ask me the question you really wanna ask?
Okay, well, what is...?
What question is that?
Why did I single you out?
Okay, okay, why did you single me out?
Why do you think I singled you out?
Because I'm the new guy and you guys wanna do something to me?
Do you wanna do something to me?
No, no.
I don't...
I don't...
I wasn't...
I don't...
I mean, what?
I...
Is that okay with you?
Is it okay with you?
Look, no, no, no, I don't...
I mean, that depends on what you wanna do.
What are we talking about?
What's rule number two?
Oh...
- No leaders?
- What do you think that means?
It means we can... do whatever we want.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, man.
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
I...
I'm terrible at this.
Please just tell me.
Why don't you just say it?
Is it because you don't know?
Or you're afraid that I might judge your answer?
No...
Would you like to go to the Wish Room?
The what?
What's the Wish Room?
What do you think it is?
I...
I imagine it's a room where you make a wish and it comes true?
Is that the kind of room that you'd like to go to?
I mean, who wouldn't, right?
I don't know.
Who wouldn't?
So, what you're saying is that I ask you, tell you, to take me to the Wish Room and you'd take me there?
Do you think that's the way this works?
Take me to the Wish Room.
Relax.
You're floating away.
Breathe.
Breathe.
You are floating away.
Oh, sorry.
Surrender to the power of the ocean.
Breathe.
What the fuck?
Hey!
Surrender to the power of the ocean.
Breathe.
Jesus Christ.
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Hello?
Where'd everyone go?
Be quiet.
We're all good, right?
All good?
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
Uh...
No, no, no.
Come on in, please.
Uh...
No, I...
I...
I...
Welcome.
Join us.
Okay, but I'm a fetus, I guess.
I'm just looking for the big room.
Oh, we have plenty of space in here.
Please, have a seat.
Right.
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
What's your name?
Uh, Kyle.
Kyle.
I'm Air.
- Hi.
- I feel like I knew you were coming.
Did you feel it, too?
Um...
Well...
We're really glad to have you join us.
Join our circle.
Thank you.
Great.
Yeah, me too.
Okay, everyone, relax.
Close your eyes.
Relax.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Feel each other's presence.
There's something else in the room, isn't there?
Does everyone else feel it?
It's floating.
Somewhere... over there.
Over Kyle.
Near the ceiling.
Oh.
It's a wave of pure white light.
Breathe it in.
Something's not right.
Something's not right.
I feel like it wants to hurt me.
Like it's inside of me, touching me with it's...
Oh, God, who brought this thing in here?
!
You okay?
- It's okay.
It's okay, what's wrong?
- I'm sorry.
I lost the connection.
I'm so sorry.
I'm trying so hard.
Don't be sorry.
Let's explore that.
When did you lose it?
Mmm.
Well, I think I might know the answer.
You mind if I say it?
Was it when this asshole burst in here like a wet fart?
Wait.
Wha...?
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
It's over, okay?
Come on, come on.
There you go, there you go.
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- I am so sorry.
Why don't you go ahead and have a seat, okay?
There you go.
- Hey, I'm sorry.
I...
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're okay, right, Air?
See?
See?
No one got punched in the face.
All right?
Let's reboot.
Not restart.
It's good.
Okay, so...
How about we try it again?
Yup?
Kyle?
You wanna give it a shot?
- I don't know what you guys are doing.
- Don't worry, no one's gonna bite.
Stand up.
- Come on, stand up.
- Sorry.
There you go.
There you go.
Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm...
Yeah.
- Okay.
All right.
Okay, come on.
- All right.
- Sorry.
Go ahead.
What do you want me to do?
Just go for it.
Go ahead and lead us.
Okay, I...
Sorry, I'm not supposed to be here now, so...
You're not supposed to be here now?
Yeah, yeah, no.
I was with the...
Or I missed the end of the orientation, so I think I'm...
Uh, I'm supposed to be, you know...
This is, like, an advanced group, right?
Wow.
Mm.
Someone wanna tell me where the advanced group is?
That sounds pretty cool.
What do they teach in the advanced group?
How to walk through walls and shit?
Okay.
- You want me to leave?
- Why are you asking me?
This is like an exercise, right?
This is like an exercise?
No.
No.
This is reality.
Are you supposed to be here or not?
You tell me.
I've never fucking met you.
Okay.
I'm gonna...
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
Relax, come here.
I'm just fucking with you to make a point, okay?
You are supposed to be here, Kyle.
Please, stay with us.
- You're supposed to be here, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, sit down.
Come on.
Come on, sit down.
You're good, come on.
There you go.
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
That's okay, man.
Oh, what happened?
Someone hit you?
The fuck?
!
Or it's just an exercise.
So, what do you do when someone hits you?
You just take it like that?
Fuck, man, you can't just fucking hit people!
Why not?
Anyone else think their ego trumps the death of the universe?
You can leave any time.
What about you, Spielberg?
You getting enough for your spank reel?
Let me out now!
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Everything was just fine till you showed up.
Wasn't it, gang?
- I don't need this.
- You don't need what?
I don't need whatever bullshit test you're teaching, man.
Don't you fucking listen to anything?
There are no teachers here.
- I'm not gonna hit you, man.
- What?
Why would I want you to hit me?
Is that how you get hard?
You make Daddy spank you?
- Oh, no, what's going on?
No one there?
- God.
Maybe they want you here for a reason.
Why don't you sit the fuck down next to Air and she can tell you more about what angel dicks taste like.
Really nice, guys.
You just let this guy bully you?
They're here to admit that consciousness is a mistake.
- Not take over class on day one.
- Oh, whatever.
Jesus Christ!
You got a seriously fucked up life, man.
I almost felt bad for you.
Cute wife.
You think you were her first choice?
Wow, look at those guys.
Nice polo.
- These guys even alive?
- How did you get these?
"Hey, guys, totally got the hookup from National First on my mortgage.
Hashtag "first time homeowner," hashtag "woot," hashtag "YOLO."
Wow.
Really good to see that $80,000 creative writing MFA isn't going to waste.
How did you get these?
- Is that my phone?
- Technically, until the end of the weekend, it's our phone.
- Give me that back.
- This isn't really a phone, is it?
- This is the key to his prison cell.
- Oh, my fucking God.
Wow.
You see that?
You see how worked up he's getting?
- I believe that's what we call a red flag.
- You stole my phone.
You gave this to total strangers willingly!
This has got your entire life on here, man.
Pictures of your daughter, your wife.
- Fuck.
- Layout of your house.
Home addresses of friends and family.
The passwords of your security systems and bank accounts just saved in your e-mail folder, like an idiot.
You don't even have a passcode on this.
Hey, hey, no...
It's okay.
Dude, it is okay.
I'm as bad as you.
We all are, aren't we?
This?
This is not reality.
None of the shit on here is real.
That's reality.
This is just silicon and air.
Let me out.
- Oh, come on.
It's over, let's be friends.
- I wanna leave right now.
Don't you listen to anything?
You can go any time you want.
There's the door.
Namaste.
All right, everybody take off your clothes.
Fucking goddamn it.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck!
- Can we help you?
- How do I get out of here?
Are you feeling all right?
You look a little...
Hey, hey.
Hold on one second.
Are you sure you feel all right?
Just show me how to get out of this dungeon.
Oh.
I think it's this way.
I'm Todd, by the way.
You're Kyle, right?
How do you know my name?
You're the one that Ray picked on in his speech, right?
Hey, don't feel bad about that.
He always tries to throw you off-balance your first time.
- It's sort of an honor.
- Just show me how to get out of here.
Cool, cool.
Yeah, right this way.
Can I just say something, Kyle?
Kyle, if I may.
- Breathe.
- I am.
No, no, really take a second.
You know, calm your body and just breathe.
Breathe?
You want me to breathe?
A guy fucking punched me, threw a chair, broke into my phone.
Wow.
Okay, was he trying to make a point or...?
I don't care.
I know where you're coming from, man.
- Yeah, Rebirth, it's intense.
- Fuck.
I washed out my first three tries.
And it took me four years before I came back.
Lost everything in those four years.
My job, my credit, my house.
My two girls wouldn't even talk to me because I couldn't face the things that Rebirth was trying to get me to confront.
- I don't care.
- Can I just say?
The whole point of Rebirth, basically, is to find what you need, not what you want.
And sometimes, what you need, Kyle, not super-pleasant.
I don't need any of this.
Fair enough, but you know if you walk into a room and it's too heavy for you, you just leave.
That's what you're supposed to do.
See, everybody needs something different, so every room is different, but you gotta keep opening those doors.
He broke into my phone.
And it stays in the room.
Everything stays in the room.
Just show me where the exit is.
I think I know where you were.
Yeah.
Can I just say, it's not gonna get worse than that?
Unless you want it to.
Can I say that?
Is the shuttle out there?
You're already here, man.
It's more interesting than, what, a night of TV?
And don't forget about Zack.
You know Zack?
Of course I know Zack.
I love Zack.
So, Zack is here?
Uh...
I don't think I can actually say that.
You don't?
It's easy.
He's either here or he's not.
Yes or no.
No, but not no as in he's not here.
No as in...
I can't break the spoiler rule, man.
- Fuck.
- Okay, look.
Look, look, look.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not supposed to find him yet.
And if he were here, theoretically... you will.
Maybe.
I wish I could say more.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay.
Off the record.
There are no leaders here, man.
Zack is doing his Rebirth just like everybody else.
Just like everybody else.
And when you're supposed to find him...
I'm gonna take you to a room you're gonna love, okay?
Spoiler curtain down.
You are gonna love it.
Man to man, no cameras, no bullshit.
You're gonna love this room.
Hey, guys.
This is Kyle.
He's a good friend of Zack's.
- Hi, Kyle.
- I love Zack.
Welcome, Kyle.
I'm Gabriel.
Call me Gabe.
Come.
Join us.
This is Kyle's first Rebirth.
He's feeling a little overwhelmed.
He could really use some unconditional love.
Leave the door open.
Whatever makes you comfortable.
If anybody fucks with me again, I will call 911.
Deal.
- Mm.
- Mm.
- Welcome.
- Hi.
Okay.
That's all right.
Hi.
Kyle.
This circle is about honesty.
It's about saying whatever's on your mind right now, in the moment.
Okay.
Kyle, I feel like you're really nervous right now.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, yeah.
That's okay, that's okay.
Just tell us what you're thinking at this moment.
Now... be honest.
Okay.
Uh...
I think this whole Rebirth thing is pretty fucked up.
- Mm.
- Hmm.
Hm.
Mm.
I remember feeling the exact same way.
- I totally empathize.
- Okay, thank you.
Is there something you wanna share with the group?
Nope, nope.
Everything's good.
It's all great.
Everything's great.
Thank you, that's fine.
Thank you.
Carry on.
You know, I don't...
I don't feel like you're being honest.
I don't feel like that, either.
Yeah, well, what do you want?
All we want is honesty.
Now, if you have to say something negative just be honest about it.
Okay.
I think this is a fucking joke.
I think you're all a bunch of arrogant assholes who think you're superior to everyone because...
I don't know, you're so open-minded, it'd be okay if someone shot you in the face?
And I'm fucking pissed I wasted a day I could've spent with my kid doing this hippie bullshit my friend, who I don't even really know is my friend, tricked me into.
And I don't know what this is, but I wouldn't be surprised if you dick-sacks are stealing my identity right now.
And I wanna go home.
Is that honest enough for you, Gabe?
I just wanna say that I'm really connecting to what Kyle is feeling right now.
Me too.
What's making you feel connected to Kyle?
I guess, his honesty about feeling like he doesn't belong, because I was feeling that way, too.
And I'm glad that someone just came in here and called everyone on their bullshit.
Mmm.
Kyle.
How do you feel about that?
Uh, good, I guess.
I'm feeling, like, a lot of anger out of you.
But, like, a lot of life, too,
- and I don't know, um... vitality?
- Mm.
- And I'm kind of really drawn to that.
- Me too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm feeling like this tractor beam of male energy... that I haven't felt anywhere else this weekend.
Can I say something weird?
Just stay in the moment.
I feel like, I go to these kinds of things a lot, and I meet a lot of guys who wanna be here.
But I never meet guys who should be here until now.
And this is probably terrible to say about a first-timer, but...
I probably shouldn't say it.
Just... tell the truth.
When I look at Kyle I see this huge, angry erect cock.
Do you feel threatened by the cock?
How does the cock make you feel?
Happy.
Intrigued.
Okay.
Horny.
Kyle.
How do you feel hearing this?
Uh...
I...
It...
Good.
This...
I mean, it's nice.
Thank you.
- Is that all?
- I, uh...
Um...
I don't know.
Do you feel any shame having these women tell you how they feel about you?
No, no.
No, no, no.
I don't know, I don't know.
Oh, good, good.
Stay with that.
How about you, Betty?
What do you feel about Kyle right now?
I'm starting to feel really turned on.
I just wanna say that I'm feeling this amazing spontaneity in the room right now.
I feel like we're all on the same wavelength of breaking through our inhibitions and doing something really crazy, don't you, guys?
Do you feel like you're waiting for someone to take the first step?
- Kind of.
- Mm.
Kind of.
Man.
All right.
Now I wanna check back in with Kyle.
Kyle.
Kyle.
How are you feeling?
Do you feel safe?
Uh, heh...
Yeah?
Uh, you know that felt more like a question than an answer.
- Do you still wanna go home?
- Uh...
Hmm?
Hello?
!
Kyle.
What would you like to have happen in this room?
- Hello?
!
- I don't know, I don't...
Not sure.
Hello?
- Betty?
- Hello?
What do you want Kyle to do right now?
I want Kyle to fuck me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Please, please.
- Kyle, do you wanna do that?
Somebody help me!
Please.
I, uh...
What is...?
- Please, somebody help me!
- Who is that?
What is that?
You fucking sick motherfuckers!
All right, does anybody...?
Do you hear...?
Is that a thing?
Is that part of this?
Why do you think that person is your responsibility?
This is so fucked up!
All right, all right, all right.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
- I know, right?
- Who is that?
Do you think that man's needs trump your own?
What is this?
Is this part of this?
Is this part of the thing?
You can't return to the same place twice.
I'm being held against my will!
Jesus.
Held against my will!
Anybody.
Anybody, please.
Who is that?
- Can anybody fucking hear me?
- Hello?
What the fuck?
- Hello?
- Oh, God, please!
What the hell is going on?
What do you think is going on?
- Is someone out there?
- Who is that?
- Who do you think it is?
- Stop.
Stop.
- Stop with that shit!
- Stop what?
Anybody, please.
Anybody.
Kyle, please stop.
He's fine.
- Open the door!
- Is someone out there?
Okay, it's not what it looks like.
He knows he can quit any time.
Hello?
!
Hello?
Hello?
Goddamn it, is this real?
!
Okay, the man behind this door is at a very delicate phase of his Rebirth.
- Shut up.
I don't wanna hear it!
- Okay, just stop.
I never told you about my life before Rebirth.
I don't care.
I could tell you I was a drug addict.
I could tell you that my kid was taken away from me.
I could tell you anything, but it doesn't matter.
What matters is I'm not the same person I used to be.
- Please.
- I don't even know your name, lady.
Kyle!
Okay, I know this looks crazy, but he actually needs this.
Jesus, Zack.
- Zack?
- Stop talking to him.
- We need help.
- What are they doing to you?
It's okay.
I don't want you to talk to him.
We're getting help...
- Get out of here!
- It's okay, sweetie...
Shut up!
Okay.
I'm gonna get you down, all right?
Jesus.
Fuck.
Okay.
All right, all right, hold still.
Oh, I can feel your belly.
What the fuck happened to your pants, man?
- Ha-ha-ha!
- What the hell are you laughing at?
God.
What the fuck did they do...?
- Oh, fuck.
- Careful.
One of those buckets is my bathroom.
What?
Hey, did I, like, tell you how much it means to me
- that you came this weekend?
- Put this on.
- Okay?
Put this on.
- Is it time?
Is it T-shirt time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's T-shirt time.
Come on, come on.
Jesus Christ.
What are these, man?
Are these branding marks?
Those are my Rebirths, man.
Come on, come on, come on.
Jesse's trying...
Is helping break my attachments to the domination game.
To, like, the status thing.
You know what I'm saying?
- You're gonna put these pants on.
- No, no, no.
Put the pants on.
Put them on.
You were just screaming for help.
Why not?
No, no, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no.
No.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Stop hurting him!
Stop hurting him.
Zack, are you okay?
Where's Jesse?
Is Jesse out there?
Naomi, just...
Could you get Jesse?
- Could you get Jesse?
- Who the fuck is Jesse?
Jesse's coming, honey.
Hang in there.
Okay, thank you, Naomi.
All right, I hope you know that I have called the police, and they are on their way.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
- Fuck.
Hey, Kyle, Kyle, I...
- Oh, fuck.
Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop.
What's wrong with you?
It's okay.
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's my supplements.
- Are they drugging you?
- No, no.
Not drugs.
They're supplements.
My God.
You're not gonna hurt Jesse, are you?
- You're not gonna hurt Jesse.
- You're drugging him?
How long have you been with these people?
- Uh...
- Huh?
That I don't...
Because we jump around a lot, you know what I mean?
Because Je...
Have you met Jesse?
Who the fuck is Jesse?
- Jesse's almost here.
- It's okay, it's okay.
Because this is my friend.
This is my best friend, Naomi.
Oh, God.
Wait, wait.
You're not...
Hold on.
I hope the money...
- Is the money...?
Are you mad about...?
- What do you mean?
What money?
What money?
Jesse says that money is just a construct, too.
- So, it's fine, it's fine.
- No, no, no.
They didn't make you give them your money.
No, no, no, not my money.
Your money.
What do you mean, my money?
What are you talking about?
What does he mean, my money?
You shouldn't be talking to him right now, asshole.
What do you mean, my money?
What have you done?
- What did you freaks do to my money?
- You're doing it!
What did you do?
What have you done to me?
What did I...?
What...?
Zachariah, are you there?
- Jesse!
- Okay, why are...?
Come on.
- Jesse.
- Aah!
- I come in peace.
- Aah!
No, Kyle, no!
- No!
- Zachariah, stop it.
Your friend can't help it.
He's not a Birthling.
What did we talk about?
Your friend is not a Birthling.
You can't be expecting him to have the insight...
Sir, I believe in a peaceful revolution through massage and the...
Stop it!
Stop with your brainwashing bullshit.
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you.
What the fuck is this, huh?
Cupcakes?
What the fuck is going on?
!
Aah!
- Jesse!
Jesse!
- No, no, no.
No, we've seen your friend.
Now we're leaving.
No, no, no.
Let him help you.
Tell me what your body's feeling.
Tell me what your body's feeling.
- Please, please.
- Every cell in your body has been trained by millions of years of evolution to fight, to survive.
What you're feeling now is real life.
Don't you feel it?
You're just not used to such a pure dose.
Your mind's reacting.
Shut up.
My friend was shitting in a bucket, screaming for help!
No, no, you're hurting Jesse.
- Knock it down, knock it down.
- That was real.
Do it again.
- No, no, hit me again, please.
- Do it again.
- Stop it.
- No, hit me.
- Shut up.
- Hit me again.
- Just knock it down!
- Stay out!
- Stay out!
- Knock it down!
Hit me again.
- They're coming!
- Back off, I'll do it.
I'll fucking do it.
Come on, Zack, let's go.
It's okay, it's okay, Kyle, okay?
- We still love you.
- Zack?
Kyle's the master now.
Do what he says.
- Okay.
- This is it.
- Can you feel it?
- Yes, I can feel it.
Shut up!
Back off.
Zack, let's go, move.
All right, everybody back off, or I will kill him!
Do it, man.
Do it.
Shut up, man!
- Go, go.
Get back, get back.
- Okay, okay, no one's gonna get hurt.
- Kill me now, master.
I'm ready to ascend.
- That's enough, Jesse.
Stop it.
I think we got a situation here.
You need to kill that footage now.
Go.
Where do we go?
Do we go down?
Where the fuck do we go?
Zack!
We got a breach!
Breach!
Okay, Zack, I need to know what you've told him.
Don't talk to her, Zack, all right?
He didn't tell me nothing, okay?
We just wanna get on that shuttle and go home.
Where the fuck is the exit?
!
Sir, sir, you know this is not real, right?
- Shut up, shut up.
- Okay, all right, what's your name?
- What's his name?
- Kyle-something.
- This guy is having a psychotic episode.
- Yeah, no shit.
- Can we get a doctor over here, please?
- Yeah.
How do you get out of here?
Hey, honey, the exit is this way, where it's always been.
Found a doctor.
Okay, sir, can we just stop moving for a second?
Okay, everyone.
Just stay calm.
Sir, what's your name?
- What's his name?
- Kyle.
- It's Kyle.
- Okay, Karl.
I'm a psychiatrist at First Memorial.
I'm here for the seminar, like you.
You just tell him to stop whatever the fuck he's trying to do.
- Just let us go, all right?
- No...
No problem.
Some people's brains have a hard time adjusting to Rebirth.
So, just breathe.
They're trying to lock you back in their cage, master.
- Don't listen to them.
- Shut up, Jesse.
- I think he went to the Wish Room.
- Yes, he did.
I took him there.
- Jesus Christ.
- That's it.
That's the door.
- That's the door.
- Are you sure?
- Stand back, stand back.
- Stay.
- Easy.
- Open the door, Zack.
Get over here and open the fucking door.
- It's locked.
- Listen.
If you go back into the real world without decompressing, you're gonna have a serious brain damage...
- Shut up!
- It's not a door.
It's a wall.
It's a window, open it.
Shut up!
Everyone shut up and just let me think!
No.
Hey, Karl, Karl, don't do it, man.
Karl, don't do it, man.
Don't do something you're gonna regret.
- Come back home.
- It's a stupid thing to do.
It's a stupid thing to do.
- Karl, don't do it...
- Shut up!
Nobody fucking move.
Zack.
Let's go.
Zack, let's go.
All right, move.
Hello?
Hello?
!
Oh, my God.
I'm so fucking hard right now.
God, fuck.
Zack!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Aah!
Zack!
Zack!
It's okay, really.
- What's going on?
- That's not funny.
What the fuck is going on?
Told you, man.
Zack!
Welcome home, brother.
Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
No, no, no!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Zack?
Zack?
Zack?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Oh, shit, man.
Hey, everybody.
Let's show my boy Kyle some Rebirth love.
- What...?
- What do you think, man?
What do you think?
You think they like you?
Hey, what some of you may not know...
What some of you may not know is that this man is like a brother to me.
And what you may also not know, is that this guy right here, is one of the main inspirations for all of this.
Huh?
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
That's the man.
That's it.
Huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
And you know what else?
I think this motherfucker just made Phase 2 in record time.
- Right here, Phase Two.
- What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Right?
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What's that, brother?
What?
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, man.
You just Rebirthed, you know?
You just Rebirthed.
That's a rush.
It's a rush.
It's just adrenaline.
It's just adrenaline.
Here, tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
- Tell the camera.
- No, no.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Don't fucking touch me.
Don't fucking touch me!
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Ease off.
Hey, hey, hey.
Kyle, this is the best part.
Hey, man.
It's over.
It's over, man.
- Don't touch me.
- Kyle.
Kyle.
- Don't touch me.
- This is the best part.
Hey, let's get Kyle back, everybody.
- Kyle!
Kyle!
- Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
Hey, man.
Kyle.
Kyle, hey.
Kyle, come on, give me a chance...
Let me expl...
It's over, man.
- Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Okay, all right, okay, no problem.
Take me to my car or I call the police.
Kyle.
Nothing was ever gonna happen.
Nobody was gonna get...
Jesse's a stuntman.
He's, like, a black belt.
I did this...
I thought...
I thought you would dig it.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I don't wanna talk to this guy.
Can you shut the door?
- Can you shut the door?
- Are you coming on, sir?
No, he's not.
He's not.
Mary?
Uh...
I'm done.
I'm done.
It's over.
Hey, where are you guys now?
We're coming back from swim practice.
We're almost home.
Right.
Uh...
- Right.
Okay.
- Okay, bye.
No.
No.
No.
Fuck.

Got a towel, man?
Jesus, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
Man, you know, after one of these weekends, it feels, like, a tour in Kabul, man.
I need me, like, a nice hot soak.
My wife is coming home.
This is my house!
I know.
It's nice, man.
Really digging the Jacuzzi.
No towel?
- Hey, guy, you need any help with that?
- What have you done?
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're not finished.
Fuck you.
This, this is over.
Come on.
There's an after party at Jesse's.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God is right.
I mean, those sheets are amazing.
- What's the thread count on those?
- Mary is gonna be home.
Any second.
What else did you do?
I didn't do anything.
I've been in the bath the whole time.
Hey, man, do you mind if I put some tunes on?
I already guessed the Wi-Fi password was "Mumford." Heh.
- Check it out, dude, you made the cover.
- Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Just stop.
Stop it.
Stop!
Why are you trying to destroy my life?
I'm not trying to destroy your life, man.
I'm trying to save your life.
I'm here to help you.
I don't want your help!
Oh, fuck!
What do you people want from me?
We want you to stop living your life like a spectator, okay?
That's it?
You all done?
All out of fight?
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Fuck the man.
Keep it real.
Don't be boring.
- What?
What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you!
I'm talking about your dogma, dude.
The Manifesto?
Your words?
Do they mean anything to you anymore?
Oh, my God.
You mean, do I believe in a thing we wrote as a joke when we were 20 years old on shrooms?
Yeah.
It wasn't a joke.
And you know it.
Stop.
Stop it, all right?
Just stop.
Just tell me what you want before Mary comes home.
I wanna help.
- You're destroying my life!
- You're destroying your life!
You're destroying it!
You sit all day at a job you fucking hate.
You bilk young kids out of money, so they're so immersed in debt that they're enslaved to the system for the rest of their fucking lives.
You can't get a boner, dude.
And you know what the worst part is?
You're really boring.
You're a child.
I'm not 20 anymore.
Thank you.
I know.
I am a child.
So, that way, I can see the world for what it really is, unlike the way the zombies have conditioned you to see it.
The zombies?
I'm an adult.
I have a family.
It's a fucking job!
Right, and I bet the only way to keep your child from starving is lying for a bank!
You have this juvenile obsession with what?
Am I the guy who created this system you hate...?
I don't give a fuck about the system, okay?
I care about you.
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Yeah.
- I can tell.
- Not this you, okay?
Not this you.
The you you used to be.
- Before the fucking lobotomy.
- I like my life.
Oh, do you like your life?
I like my life.
You should fucking love your life, Kyle.
You should've seen your eyes.
You should've seen your eyes when I described this weekend to you.
It was like I was offering you, like, a drop of water and you were just dying of thirst.
No.
I didn't know what it was.
It was called Rebirth!
What'd you think that meant, huh?
It means being born again.
It means a new life.
And that also, Kyle, means killing the old one, you understand?
This is also why we had to drain your savings account.
No, no, no.
That was not real.
That was a fake site.
Mm.
It was real.
It's all real.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Just relax.
Relax.
Relax.
- Oh, my God.
Nothing is gonna happen, Kyle, okay?
I'm gonna set you free.
All right, what do you want?
How do I make this stop, all right?
What do you want from me?
What do I want from you?
What do you want from you?
I want the same thing.
I want you to reach enlightenment.
Yes.
Okay, I'll do anything you want.
Just don't do this to my family.
Okay, in order for it to stop...
Right?
You have to tell me that you felt something at Rebirth.
Yes, yes, yes, I felt something.
- Okay, good.
What'd you feel?
- Uh...
I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?
- No, no, it has to be in your own words.
- Oh, fuck.
Just tell me what you wanna hear.
Okay, close your eyes.
Just close your eyes and tell me the truth, brother.
- I felt scared, all right?
- Good, good, good.
- I felt like I was gonna die.
- Great.
I feel like I've been through a fucking war.
Yes.
That's all I wanted to hear.
That's it.
- That's it?
That's it?
That's it?
- Yeah, man.
You've seen the other side.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- You can go back to your desk and tweet, twat, whatever the fuck you've been doing for the rest of your life.
But nobody, nobody's gonna take the moment away from you when you held a knife to a cult leader's throat and busted your way out of a sex dungeon.
- Huh?
- Right.
Right.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And the sex dungeon part.
- That's over, too, right?
- It's over.
I promise.
- Hello.
- Hey, we're in here.
I promise, man.
Okay?
You just gotta make a little donation.
Zack.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.
Oh, man.
Is this crazy or what?
- Oh, boy.
- So crazy.
Wow.
Look at you.
Oh, man, you look amazing.
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha.
- You guys look sweaty.
- Oh, yeah.
We're guys.
- How long's it been?
- I don't know.
I mean, long enough for you two lovebirds to have a little one, right?
- Right.
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, Jill, come meet Mom and Dad's friend.
No, no, no, wait.
No, no, no.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Zack was just about to leave.
- Whoa.
No, no, no, I'm dying to meet her.
- Yay.
Let me get her.
- Great.
Wow, she's looking good, man.
- What do you mean, a donation?
You know, a meaningful donation.
I mean, we are a non-profit.
- Like money?
- Yeah, money's good.
- How much money?
- Some money from your bank would be nice.
I don't have access to my bank's money.
Oh, sure you do.
I write tweets to idiots who follow a bank on Twitter.
- I don't have acc...
- All you gotta do is log on to your bank's server from your computer, okay?
The algorithm will do the rest.
- What algorithm?
- Don't worry about it.
Her Highness is on her way down.
Hey, so, I watched some of the videos from Rebirth.
What?
Just the ones that you e-mailed me.
What?
E-mailed?
Yeah, with the testimonials or whatever.
It actually looked kind of intriguing.
- You're not supposed to do that.
- Oh, no.
No, no, it's okay.
Hey, hey, look, as long as we're breaking the rules here,
- I have some video of your boy.
- Oh!
- No, no, no.
- Wait, I wanna see it.
It's...
It's embarrassing, really.
Right, and you can't share the weekend with outsiders.
Oh, wow.
- It already sounds like a cult.
- No, it's not a cult.
I hear Kyle says that you guys go to a church.
Yeah, we do.
- Yeah?
Oh, I mean, you guys should like...
I mean, you should come.
You know, they like people from, like, all different kinds
- of, you know, spiritual paths.
- She's not interested.
Actually, I don't know.
If you guys both really liked it,
- I'd be open-minded about it.
- She's not interested.
She's not gonna do it, okay?
Just leave us alone.
Kyle.
I think it's time you should leave.
Are you sure?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey, sweetie!
Jill, this is Zack.
Hi, Jill, it's so nice to meet you.
You are as beautiful as your mother.
Hey.
Does anybody want any Kool-Aid?
There's still plenty left over from the seminar.
Huh?
- Sure, that'd be good.
- Yeah.
I know when I was a kid, I loved Kool-Aid.
Kids still like Kool-Aid, don't they, Jill?
- Okay.
- Yummy.
- Hey, she's not thirsty.
- Kyle, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'll do it, okay?
- I'll do it.
- Okay.
Kyle, what's going on here?
No, this is...
This is over, all right?
All right, I'll do it.
Um...
I think Kyle had kind of an intense day, and I think he just needs a little decompression time.
Oh.
Uh...
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I was...
- No, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's not a big deal, okay?
Just stop talking.
All right.
Well, how about us guys take a little retreat to the man cave?
If that's okay with you young ladies?
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?
Okay.
Well, fantastic, let's do it, bud.
- It's all right.
- Bye.
So nice to meet you.
Hey.
So, Naomi's gonna shoot a little testimonial video, if that's okay with you.
So, I wanna be clear.
I'm not going to get in trouble, right?
Of course not.
You're my friend.
Are you sure?
We will never take enough to get detected, okay?
I promise.
This is a good thing, Kyle.
You have an insane amount of potential.
You're gonna be an integral part of this community.
You're gonna run our new Media and Communications Department.
You're gonna help us reach a whole new group of people.
Help us make this something really big.
Help me, Kyle.
Help us.
Help yourself.
Have some fun for once in your life.
I mean, the worst case scenario is you make a ton of money.
Dude, I guarantee you, in five years, you're gonna think this is the greatest thing that ever happened to you.
And... if you don't you can leave any time you want.
You know, before I found Rebirth, I was lost.
I really was.
And the worst thing was I didn't know I was lost.
I was bottled up, and it would come out in the dumbest ways.
Just basic stuff, like getting impatient with my wife, or spending all day long looking at my phone, and then getting mad in traffic.
Kyle was a great husband, a great father, a great provider.
Um, but he just...
He wasn't happy.
And it affected all of us.
I was living this default life that everyone around me assumed was the best life possible.
But it just wasn't making me happy.
And then I found Rebirth.
Hi, my name is Kyle Madison, and I wanna tell you my Rebirth story.
Oh, yeah.
I remember Kyle's first time at Rebirth.
He was like...
You know, he was like, "What the hell did I just get myself involved in?"
It was almost like watching a game show where you already know that the contestant's won a million dollars, but they don't know yet.
Kyle.
His first time, you know, he was so sweet.
He was so open and fragile.
I just wanted to give him a massive Rebirth hug and be his mommy.
Everyone who was there was like, "Yup, scared that one off."
I mean, I honestly never thought I was gonna see this guy ever again.
Hi, my name's Kyle Madison, and I just finished my first Rebirth.
Is that all right?
The next weekend, he comes back.
So, I'm like, "Okay."
Weekend after that, we were in Cincinnati and Kyle flies in.
And, you know, that was it, that's when I knew that this guy was totally hooked.
I mean, his Z.W. potentials just exploded.
Kyle had been on my team for, like, five years, I think.
But he was one of those guys who's always in the back.
A nice guy, but never really initiated, you know?
Uh, but then, one Monday morning, he came in, and it was like bam!
You know?
Who is this guy?
Suddenly, I had Mark Zuckerberg working for me, you know?
- Kyle's the man.
- The man's a god.
It just brings clarity.
That's all.
There's the world before Rebirth and the world after.
Everything unimportant just falls away.
You look at the world and you just see reality.
Just like that.
He's killing everyone with his perspectives.
Just murdering them.
And finally, I was like, "Hey, what's the secret?" You know?
And he looks at me, and he says, "What are you doing this weekend?"
Give it up for Chad!
Right?
I knew he'd love it.
Pretty soon, the whole team loved it.
Then the whole company loved it.
We're basically the Rebirth branch of Wall Street now.
What Rebirth did for me was...
It didn't just show me how to escape the cage I'd built around myself it actually showed me that the cage existed in the first place.
The first time my wife did her own Rebirth,
I was a little nervous, I'll admit.
But that's because I was clutching on to these zombie ideas of control, mastery and conditioned attachments.
And what you learn is your marriage only hits the stratosphere when you're both free to fly.
What people don't realize is Rebirth is not just something you do one weekend a month.
It's a lifestyle.
Right, Jill?
We want our friends to do it.
We want our parents to do it.
Our nanny, our neighbors.
We definitely want our pastor to do it.
I want my brother to do it.
- I want my mailman to do it.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I couldn't wait to get our kids to do it.
Sometimes you're there to help a couple fetuses burst out of the womb and find the warrior within.
Sometimes, you think you're there to deliver the fetus, only to find out you're the fetus and they're there for you.
It's like every time you go to Rebirth, you're a different person.
So every Rebirth's different.
You never know what you're gonna find behind a new open door.
It's not just the workshops.
It's not just the Phase Two Life Activation Experience.
It's also the products.
We don't even use the word "sell" in Rebirth.
Because once you realize how much better Rebirth's products are than what you get in the store, it just...
It sells itself.
It's healthy.
It's natural.
It's good.
None of this processed crap.
Jill is at an age where she's so picky about what she eats and she loves the stuff.
I don't know what they put in it.
- Tell them your first Rebirth, babe.
- Oh, yeah.
Heh.
You weren't breathing properly.
You can breathe with your nose, you can breathe with your mouth.
But there are other ways to breathe.
Everybody knows there are no leaders at Rebirth, because only you can change your life.
But...
But we all know who that spark was.
Zack 110 percent changed Kyle's life.
And mine too.
In the old days, people were afraid something horrible would happen to them.
Now they're afraid nothing will happen to them.
If Zack hadn't come into my life when he did...
I really don't like to think about it.
I really don't.
Zack is just one of those magical beings who can walk up to a stranger, look her in the eye and just immediately knows her deepest, most intimate needs.
Zack was like a brother to me and now that we share Rebirth, he's like a big brother.
- He's the big brother to us all.
- Yeah.
You know, when I started Rebirth in my garage, you know, building it out one weekend at a time to the global force for good that it is today that was the easy part.
You know?
Why I get out of bed every morning is knowing that there's other Kyles out there.
You know what I mean?
You see him at the grocery store.
See him at the gas station.
The drugstore.
Right?
See him on the highway.
Going to work.
Going home.
Going to work.
Going home, you know?
Doing the Z.B. Zombie Boogie.
But if you look him them the eye, man, you'll see that they're dying, dying for something better.
They know it's out there.
They just don't know what it is, you know?
So, let's bring him up here.
Kyle Madison, everybody.
Come on, man.
Sometimes, uh, I feel like a hunter.
I got my gun, I got my bush hat on, and I'm stalking through the suburban savannah, searching for my prey and it's my job never to sleep, okay?
It's my job never to take a break, never to stop, man, until I share this with each and every Kyle.
It's an obligation.
It's a duty.
Whew.
Oh, man.
That's what gets me going.
Hmm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That's what Rebirth means to me.
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
[man over radio] The losses on the value of your 401[k]s or IRAs in the last few years.
Uh-oh.
Looks like the interns are slacking off again.
Hey, Kyle.
What's up?
[woman] The gunman was described as a loner...
I'm right behind you.
[woman] Jill, let's go.
It's time for school.
Hi, stranger. [chuckles]
Bye.
Have fun.
[elevator beeps] [smooches] Come on.
Bye.
So, any big plans this weekend?
[man] Fuck you.
Fuck you.
[chuckles] Fuck you.
Oh, man.
Fuck you, man.
[man laughing]
-Oh, fuck.
-Chad?
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
That's so fucked up.
-Are you Kyle?
-Yeah.
Hi.
The front desk says your wife is here.
Some kind of emergency.
Oh, uh, thank you.
[laughing]
Hi.
Hey, excuse me.
Did my--?
Is my wife here?
My name's Kyle Madison.
Her name's Mary.
She said there might be some--
-I'm right here.
It's okay.
-Jesus!
Wait.
What the fuck, ma--?
Oh, my God.
What?
Zack?
-Kyle?
-What?
Come here, brother.
-What are you doing?
How are you?
-Oh, Jesus.
-Look at that.
Fresh-faced.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Wow.
This is crazy timing.
Apparently my wife is here
-with some kind of emergency--
-Emergency.
-Okay.
Wow.
-Okay. [laughs]
-Right?
Come on, I got you out of school.
-Okay.
-Let's go play.
-Oh, Jesus.
No, man, I... [chuckles] Can you hang out in my office for like ten, 20, 30 minutes?
-I can do ten, 20.
-Okay, come on.
[Kyle] So, how have you been?
What happened to you?
Uh, you know, I've...
I've been. [chuckles]
I mean, you, like, disappeared, man.
Yeah.
Well, you know, me and college didn't really... you know?
But, hey, worked out for you, right?
So, what the heck are you doing here, man?
Oh, I'm here to save your soul.
Amazing.
Save it from what?
The zombies.
I mean, like, what is this place?
Uh, it's an office.
Maybe you've heard of them.
Yeah, I've heard of them, but I mean, like, what does this office in particular, like, you know, make?
It's a bank.
Oh, it's a bank?
You're a banker?
Uh, no.
No, I'm not.
I'm the--
I'm a social media coordinator.
-Oh, okay.
-It's actually-
- It's...
It's actually kind of pretty creative.
Uh...
I get to write on social media using different personas.
Like, different characters almost for different...
Okay, for example.
Right now, we're doing this, um, big Twitter campaign
-for our mortgage division.
-Uh-huh.
Turns out, research says that it's, you know, it's super-hard for millennials to get interested in mortgages because of the economy and stuff.
And so it's my job to, you know, appeal to different demographics.
And, you know--
Hey, you still have the Manifesto?
The what?
The Manifesto, man.
Don't tell me you threw it away.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you remember that.
Remember?
Dude, I am never gonna forget the Manifesto as long as...
Hey, what are you doing Saturday?
Uh, jeez.
Um...
Saturday, I actually think I have to come back in.
My boss--
-No, you're not.
You're coming with me.
-Oh, I wish, man.
-What are you doing?
-What are we doing?
[chuckles] Okay, what are we doing?
[makes muffled noise] [laughs]
Okay.
What does that mean?
Okay.
It means, I got into town this morning, right?
To do this--
I mean, I don't know how to-- I mean, to do this really cool thing.
You know?
And then suddenly, I was like, holy shit.
Kyle.
Kyle!
Kyle lives here.
I miss Kyle.
I need Kyle.
And, you know, I think I can get you in.
And it's gonna be amazing, and we're gonna do it.
[chuckles] We're gonna do what?
We're gonna have, you know, an experience.
[both chuckling]
Oh, no.
[both laughing]
Okay.
Okay.
What kind of experience?
What kind of experience do you want?
Wow.
-Okay.
Um...
-Right?
And when does--?
Or how long does this experience take?
It takes as long you want it to take.
You know what I mean?
No, no, not really.
Well, can you be any less specific?
I cannot.
And I will not say another word until you agree to come.
Oh, man, Zack.
-I missed you, man. [chuckles]
-I missed you, man.
Why couldn't you have given me, like, any notice?
Kyle, I really want you to do this with me.
What if I said it was like a workshop?
Like a motivational workshop?
Wha--?
Okay.
[phone rings]
Social Media, this is Kyle.
Hey, Chad.
-Yeah.
-Okay, you're coming with me, all right?
It's 100 bucks.
I can front you the money--
I mean, I don't have a credit card.
I don't care about the money.
It's- [Chad] Yo, Kyle, my man.
-Oh, my...
What about drinks?
Sunday night.
What's your number?
-I don't have a number.
-You don't have a number.
What?
-What do you mean?
You don't--?
-I don't have a number.
-[Chad] Kyle?
-Um...
Okay.
Sit down.
Sit down, all right?
-And I will be right back.
-Okay.
-Don't go anywhere, okay?
-Okay.
-Hey, Chad.
Did you--?
-One sec, bud.
You're fucking me.
Oh, you are fucking me.
-Chad?
-Ha-ha!
-You're so fucking me right now, man.
-All right, I got a friend, but...
Stop it.
Fuck you.
[Chad laughing]
[Chad] Fuck you, man.
You're fucking killing me.
What'd she say?
[treadmill beeps] [panting]
What is Rebirth?
[chuckles]
Uh, let me tell you about Rebirth.
I think Rebirth, it's about getting out of your rut.
It's about getting in touch with yourself.
With your body.
[man] We live in a "one life fits all" culture.
And Rebirth dares you to find the life for you.
It's fun.
It's fast.
It's furious.
It's crazy.
It's a blast.
[woman 1] People talk about the high that they get when they climb Everest.
I don't need Everest.
I have Rebirth.
[woman 2] I'm the last person to do something like this.
But Rebirth opened me up to men, to sensuality.
To experimentation.
[woman 3] My first Rebirth, I didn't go with anyone.
I was all by myself.
And so I was really nervous and kind of shy and in my shell.
And by the end, I just felt so much more confident in myself.
And I had had some of the most intense sensual experiences of my life.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
-You coming to bed?
-Yeah, in a minute.
-What are you doing?
-Oh.
Uh...
Just looking through this old stuff.
Hey, guess who came to work today out of nowhere.
Zack.
Zack who?
You know, Zack.
From college.
[chuckles] Oh.
That guy?
Was he a student there?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Huh.
-He was wild.
-Yeah, I guess.
So, what'd he want?
Nothing, I mean, you know, he just wanted to say, "What's up?
Hi."
Okay.
Hey, hon?
Hey.
You know how you're always taking these girls' weekends?
[sighs]
Uh...
Excuse me.
Do you know where everybody went?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Hey, honey, it's me.
Listen, I think you were right.
This thing is kind of dumb.
So, I was thinking maybe I could take Jill and...
Uh...
Hold-
- I'm sorry, babe.
Let me call you right back, okay?
I'll call you right back.
Love you, bye.
[sighs]
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody in here?
[line rings]
-[woman] 911.
What is your emergency?
-No.
No, thank you.
[beeping] [lock clicks]
What?
[music playing over TV]
[man] For the best outcome, we recommend checking into a hotel the night before, away from the distractions of loved ones.
Set your humidifier to 85 percent.
Remove your clothes.
Relax.
Visualize the events of your life leading to this moment.
Breathe.
Set your alarm a few hours before your shuttle's departure time and practice the series of power poses shown earlier in this video.
[Distorted] Breathe.
[chuckles] What?
You are now centering your intentions for the day's journey and are fully prepared.
[Distorted] Breathe.
Hey.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait.
Oh, come on.
I...
I couldn't find you guys.
Thank you.
Hello?
I, uh...
Excuse me.
Oh!
Excuse me.
Ahem.
Hi.
Oh, well.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, are you going to the Rebirth thing?
I found the clues or whatever. [chuckles]
Up in one of the rooms.
It's pretty cool.
Um...
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, wait!
The deeper you look, the more you see.
Come on.
All right.
Did I get it?
I don't think you're ready to get on this bus.
Oh.
Do you always give up this easy?
No, no, no.
But you said no.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I get on the bus, please?
Sir, may I get on the bus?
I'm getting on the bus.
[chuckles]
Hey.
Ahem.
Oh.
Uh--
And what's that for?
What's that...?
All right.
Are we good?
Uh...
Mind if I squeeze in?
Do you know Zack?
Zack West.
Zachary West?
My friend?
He's...
All right.
Hey.
How's it going?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
So, hey, uh, do you mind if I sit there?
It's the only seat.
Is that your bag?
I'll just...
I'll just hold onto it, all right?
I'll just hold onto it.
Thank you.
Well, this is super-creepy.
Why are the windows covered?
Is everyone done with their forms?
Hold them up like this.
Everyone done?
Please relinquish your cell phones.
Over the next two days, you're about to experience actual person-to-person contact.
Some of you will find this highly disturbing.
Do not worry.
You will be safely re-tethered with the hive mind after the weekend.
We will not make you do anything against your morals.
You are free to leave whenever you want.
Would anybody like me to pull over the bus now and call a cab?
Rebirth is not for everyone.
You can return to the zombie world right now.
No one knows you're here.
And no one will think anything less of you.
Would anyone like to leave?
Good.
Now get your war paint on.
[brakes hiss]
[man 1 over PA] Do not speak.
Do not remove your blindfold.
If you speak, you will be asked to leave.
If you remove your blindfold, you will be asked to leave.
Do not speak.
Do not remove your blindfold.
If you speak, you will be asked to leave.
[man 2] Everybody stop!
--you will be asked to leave.
[alarm blaring]
Do not speak.
Do not... [air hissing]
--you will be asked to leave.
If you remove your blindfold, you will be asked to leave.
[man 2] Proceed!
[man 3 yelling]
[man 4] Shut up!
Put that on, you piece of shit.
[man 3] I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll be good!
[metal detector squeaking] [dog barking]
[man 5] Halt.
Remove your hands from the man in front of you.
Do not speak.
You may now remove your blindfolds.
Welcome to your Rebirth.
Oh... [over speakers] ♪ I said Welcome to your rebirth ♪ [woman vocalizes over speakers] [explosive noise] [hip-hop music playing over speakers] [man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Yeah.
[indistinct chatter] [man 3] Hey, hey, hey.
[man 4] There he is.
[all cheering] [all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
That's nice.
I don't really know what to say, though.
-Just tell the truth, brother.
-[man 5] Yeah.
Okay.
Well, if I must, then...
-Welcome home.
-[man 2] Yeah!
[man 3] Yeah!
I said, welcome the fuck home!
[all cheering]
[whooping]
Two days.
We've got two days to do this.
And then we've gotta go back out there.
Back to their bullshit.
[crowd] Yeah.
[man 6] That's right.
Two days and two rules.
The first rule, the most important rule, the golden rule, the alpha and omega rule, is you can leave any time you want.
[man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Exactly.
-[man 3] Yeah!
-What's rule number two, guys?
[all] No leaders!
Yeah, no leaders, okay?
What's rule number three?
[all] No spoilers!
You can't tell your friends what Rebirth is all about.
Just tell them to get their asses down here.
[man 4] Yeah.
[man 5] Yeah.
Now, the last rule, the platinum rule, the rule to end all rules is what?
[all] No spectators!
Fucking no spectators.
I remember the first time I made it through that hotel into Rebirth.
I thought I was a big deal.
-You know, I own three houses.
-[man 1] Yeah.
I got boats in two different oceans.
I haven't flown coach in four years.
I don't need this Rebirth bullshit.
[crowd] Yeah.
And then I realized.
The man you are before you come to Rebirth doesn't mean jack-fucking-shit!
[all cheering] [man 1] Didn't mean shit.
Out there is just an image you create for the zombie world.
-You don't get to be a zombie in here.
-[man 2] No.
You've gotta murder your inner zombie here.
[all] Yeah!
You've gotta wrap it in plastic and stuff a towel in its mouth
-to shut it the fuck up.
-[all] Yeah!
Then you gotta drive it in a car to a goddamn hole in a desert.
[all cheering]
By the way, how many fetuses do we have here today?
[all laugh]
Newbies, how many new people?
Get your hands up, let's see it.
All right, you guys may have heard some scary things about Rebirth.
Who's heard scary things?
You, what scares you about Rebirth?
Nothing.
[all laugh]
Well, I can't argue with that.
Um, all right, how about... you, big man?
Uh...
Uh...
Nothing.
[man 1] What?
[host] Fuck me.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you really just make the same joke that guy made five seconds ago?
What did we say the most important rule was?
Uh...
-Hello?
-You can leave whenever you want.
All right?
Wasn't that...?
No spectators.
-You know why we say that?
Hello?
-Uh-- Oh.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody home?
-Because, um--
-Because spectators judge.
Right?
They just sit back, they don't take risks.
And they just criticize, criticize, criticize... [blathering]
It's like those pussies on the Internet taking shots at the successful people.
Where are you from, by the way?
-Uh, Minnesota originally.
-Minnesota.
Oh, man, Minnesota.
Minnesota.
Minne-Minne-Minne-Minnesota.
Land of the stoics.
Land of good common sense.
I think Mr. Minnesota thinks he's too good for us.
Are you too good for us, Minnesota?
-No.
-They can't hear you.
-What's your name?
-Kyle.
Kyle.
You think you're too good for us, Kyle?
No, all right?
No. [chuckles]
Yes, you do.
You know how I know?
When I saw you walk in here, everybody else was dancing and letting it all hang out, and you're thinking:
"I'm too cool for this.
Self-help is for losers."
And do you know how I know?
Because I was scared my first time too.
I'm gonna let you off the hook now, Kyle.
How about a big Rebirth round of applause for Kyle?
[all cheering] [all] Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.
That's right.
When I realized what Rebirth demands and the doors it opens,
I was scared as shit.
You know who's really scared?
The zombies.
[man 1] Oh!
[man 2] Boo!
[host] They're scared we're a cult.
How about it?
Are we a cult?
[all] No!
Well, then say it.
Not a cult.
[all] Not a cult.
-Repeat it.
-[all] Not a cult.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
Not a cult.
[woman] I think you need to leave.
Not a cult.
[host] That's right.
-I said, I think you need to leave.
-[host] A cult doesn't ask questions.
-A cult gives you answers.
-What?
-Are you talking to me?
-[host] I want you to question everything.
A cult doesn't let you leave.
You don't belong in this room.
[host] We only have this building till manana.
You guys have to leave.
Are you serious?
I...
Because of what he said?
I'm pretty sure he was just using me as an example.
-[host] We're asking, keep this secret.
-I'm cool.
It's cool.
[woman] You need to leave.
[host] You're trusting that you're with people...
-You seriously want me to leave?
-Before I bring up our next guest...
-...
let's say a few words about-
- Fuck it.
-Fine.
-Fine.
-You all know who he is.
Please give a big Rebirth welcome to Jesse.
[all] Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.
[Kyle] Did I do something wrong?
My friend, Zack, signed me up for this.
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
Can I just see if he's here maybe?
Or--?
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing what?
Why did you make me leave?
-I didn't make you leave.
-Are you serious?
You said--
You said, "I think you should leave."
What--?
Oh, come on.
Because, like, you didn't force me to leave, so I should...?
Should I go back?
[chuckles]
Why do you think I asked you to leave?
[chuckles] You said I didn't belong.
So, I don't know, was I not cool enough or...?
Who exactly are you, anyway?
Are you, like, in charge or...?
Why do you think not belonging is such a bad thing?
-Isn't that the whole point?
-Whole point of what?
This.
Of this.
The point of what?
Okay. [chuckles]
Okay, okay, so, is this how this works?
Is this how what works?
Uh... [chuckles]
Is this, like, an exercise?
This whole thing?
-What whole thing?
-Heh.
You're not gonna stop, are you?
Okay, so should I...?
I'll go back to the thing now.
-What thing?
-The thing.
The seminar, dance party, whatev--
The whole reason I'm here.
Okay, okay, I'm going.
So, that's the reason you're here?
Well, I don't know.
Is there something else?
Would you like there to be something else?
I don't know.
What else is there to do?
What would you like to do?
[chuckles]
I've never been to one of these things before.
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you ask me the question you really wanna ask?
Okay, well, what is--?
What question is that?
Why did I single you out?
Okay, okay, why did you single me out?
Why do you think I singled you out?
Because I'm the new guy and you guys wanna do something to me?
Do you wanna do something to me?
No, no.
I don't-
- I don't-
- I wasn't...
I don't-
- I mean, what?
I...
Is that okay with you?
Is it okay with you?
Look, no, no, no, I don't... [chuckles]
I mean, that depends on what you wanna do.
What are we talking about?
What's rule number two?
Oh...
-No leaders?
-What do you think that means?
It means we can... do whatever we want.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, man.
-So, what do you wanna do?
-I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
I...
I'm terrible at this.
Please just tell me.
Why don't you just say it?
Is it because you don't know?
Or you're afraid that I might judge your answer?
[chuckles]
No...
Would you like to go to the Wish Room?
The what?
What's the Wish Room?
What do you think it is?
[chuckles]
I-
- I imagine it's a room where you make a wish and it comes true?
Is that the kind of room that you'd like to go to?
I mean, who wouldn't, right?
I don't know.
Who wouldn't?
So, what you're saying is that I ask you, tell you, to take me to the Wish Room and you'd take me there?
Do you think that's the way this works?
Take me to the Wish Room.
[man over speakers] Relax.
[man speaks in French]
[in English] You're floating away.
Breathe.
Breathe.
[sighs] [man speaks in French]
[door opens]
[in English] You are floating away.
Oh, sorry.
[man speaks in French]
[in English] Surrender to the power of the ocean.
Breathe.
[whale calls playing over speakers]
[woman panting]
What the fuck?
Hey!
[in English] Surrender to the power of the ocean.
[man speaks in French]
[in English] Breathe.
Jesus Christ.
[all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Hello?
Where'd everyone go?
[man 1] Be quiet.
[man 1] We're all good, right?
All good?
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
Uh...
No, no, no.
Come on in, please.
Uh...
No, I-
- I-
- I...
Welcome.
Join us.
Okay, but I'm a fetus, I guess. [chuckles]
I'm just looking for the big room.
Oh, we have plenty of space in here.
Please, have a seat.
Right.
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
What's your name?
Uh, Kyle.
Kyle.
I'm Air.
-Hi.
-I feel like I knew you were coming.
[chuckles] Did you feel it, too?
Um...
Well... [chuckles]
We're really glad to have you join us.
Join our circle.
Thank you.
Great.
Yeah, me too. [chuckles]
Okay, everyone, relax.
Close your eyes.
Relax.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Feel each other's presence.
There's something else in the room, isn't there?
Does everyone else feel it?
It's floating.
Somewhere... over there.
Over Kyle.
Near the ceiling.
Oh.
It's a wave of pure white light.
Breathe it in.
[Air gasps]
Something's not right.
Something's not right.
I feel like it wants to hurt me.
Like it's inside of me, touching me with it's--
Oh, God, who brought this thing in here?
!
[man] You okay?
-It's okay.
It's okay, what's wrong?
-I'm sorry.
I lost the connection.
I'm so sorry.
I'm trying so hard.
Don't be sorry.
Let's explore that.
When did you lose it?
Mmm.
Well, I think I might know the answer.
You mind if I say it?
Was it when this asshole burst in here like a wet fart?
[Kyle] Wait.
Wha...?
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
It's over, okay?
Come on, come on.
There you go, there you go.
-It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
-I am so sorry.
Why don't you go ahead and have a seat, okay?
There you go.
-Hey, I'm sorry.
I--
-Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're okay, right, Air?
See?
See?
No one got punched in the face.
All right?
Let's reboot.
Not restart.
It's good.
Okay, so...
How about we try it again?
Yup?
[clears throat]
Kyle?
You wanna give it a shot?
-I don't know what you guys are doing.
-Don't worry, no one's gonna bite.
Stand up.
-Come on, stand up.
-Sorry.
There you go.
[exhaling]
There you go.
Are you good?
-Yeah, I'm-
- Yeah.
-Okay.
All right.
Okay, come on.
-All right.
-Sorry.
Go ahead.
What do you want me to do?
Just go for it.
Go ahead and lead us.
Okay, I...
Sorry, I'm not supposed to be here now, so--
You're not supposed to be here now?
Yeah, yeah, no.
I was with the...
Or I missed the end of the orientation, so I think I'm...
Uh, I'm supposed to be, you know...
This is, like, an advanced group, right?
Wow.
Mm.
Someone wanna tell me where the advanced group is?
That sounds pretty cool.
What do they teach in the advanced group?
How to walk through walls and shit?
Okay.
-You want me to leave?
-Why are you asking me?
This is like an exercise, right?
This is like an exercise?
No.
No.
This is reality.
Are you supposed to be here or not?
You tell me.
I've never fucking met you.
Okay.
I'm gonna-
- Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
Relax, come here.
I'm just fucking with you to make a point, okay?
You are supposed to be here, Kyle.
Please, stay with us. [chuckles]
-You're supposed to be here, okay?
-Okay.
Okay, sit down.
Come on.
Come on, sit down.
You're good, come on.
There you go.
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
That's okay, man.
[grunting]
Oh, what happened?
Someone hit you?
The fuck?
!
Or it's just an exercise.
So, what do you do when someone hits you?
You just take it like that?
Fuck, man, you can't just fucking hit people!
Why not?
Anyone else think their ego trumps the death of the universe?
You can leave any time.
What about you, Spielberg?
You getting enough for your spank reel?
Let me out now!
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Everything was just fine till you showed up.
Wasn't it, gang?
-I don't need this.
-You don't need what?
I don't need whatever bullshit test you're teaching, man.
Don't you fucking listen to anything?
There are no teachers here.
-I'm not gonna hit you, man.
-What?
[chuckles] Why would I want you to hit me?
Is that how you get hard?
You make Daddy spank you?
-Oh, no, what's going on?
No one there?
-God.
Maybe they want you here for a reason.
Why don't you sit the fuck down next to Air and she can tell you more about what angel dicks taste like.
Really nice, guys.
You just let this guy bully you?
They're here to admit that consciousness is a mistake.
-Not take over class on day one.
-Oh, whatever.
Jesus Christ!
You got a seriously fucked up life, man.
I almost felt bad for you.
Cute wife.
You think you were her first choice?
Wow, look at those guys.
Nice polo.
-These guys even alive?
-How did you get these?
"Hey, guys, totally got the hookup from National First on my mortgage.
Hashtag "first time homeowner," hashtag "woot," hashtag "YOLO."
Wow.
Really good to see that $80,000 creative writing MFA isn't going to waste.
How did you get these?
-Is that my phone?
-Technically, until the end of the weekend, it's our phone.
-Give me that back.
-This isn't really a phone, is it?
-This is the key to his prison cell.
-Oh, my fucking God.
Wow.
You see that?
You see how worked up he's getting?
-I believe that's what we call a red flag.
-You stole my phone.
You gave this to total strangers willingly!
This has got your entire life on here, man.
Pictures of your daughter, your wife.
-Fuck.
-Layout of your house.
Home addresses of friends and family.
The passwords of your security systems and bank accounts just saved in your e-mail folder, like an idiot.
You don't even have a passcode on this.
Hey, hey, no--
It's okay.
Dude, it is okay.
I'm as bad as you.
We all are, aren't we?
This?
This is not reality.
None of the shit on here is real.
That's reality.
This is just silicon and air.
Let me out.
-Oh, come on.
It's over, let's be friends.
-I wanna leave right now.
Don't you listen to anything?
You can go any time you want.
There's the door.
Namaste.
All right, everybody take off your clothes.
[groans]
Fucking goddamn it.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck!
[sighs]
[grunting]
-Can we help you?
-[Kyle] How do I get out of here?
Are you feeling all right?
You look a little--
Hey, hey.
Hold on one second.
Are you sure you feel all right?
Just show me how to get out of this dungeon.
Oh.
I think it's this way.
I'm Todd, by the way.
You're Kyle, right?
How do you know my name?
You're the one that Ray picked on in his speech, right?
Hey, don't feel bad about that.
He always tries to throw you off-balance your first time.
-It's sort of an honor.
-Just show me how to get out of here.
Cool, cool.
Yeah, right this way.
Can I just say something, Kyle?
Kyle, if I may.
-Breathe.
-I am.
No, no, really take a second.
You know, calm your body and just breathe.
Breathe?
You want me to breathe?
A guy fucking punched me, threw a chair, broke into my phone.
Wow.
Okay, was he trying to make a point or--?
I don't care.
I know where you're coming from, man.
-Yeah, Rebirth, it's intense.
-Fuck.
I washed out my first three tries.
And it took me four years before I came back.
Lost everything in those four years.
My job, my credit, my house.
My two girls wouldn't even talk to me because I couldn't face the things that Rebirth was trying to get me to confront.
-I don't care.
-Can I just say?
The whole point of Rebirth, basically, is to find what you need, not what you want.
And sometimes, what you need, Kyle, not super-pleasant.
I don't need any of this.
Fair enough, but you know if you walk into a room and it's too heavy for you, you just leave.
That's what you're supposed to do.
See, everybody needs something different, so every room is different, but you gotta keep opening those doors.
He broke into my phone.
And it stays in the room.
Everything stays in the room.
Just show me where the exit is.
I think I know where you were.
Yeah.
Can I just say, it's not gonna get worse than that?
Unless you want it to.
Can I say that?
Is the shuttle out there?
You're already here, man.
It's more interesting than, what, a night of TV?
And don't forget about Zack.
You know Zack?
Of course I know Zack.
I love Zack.
So, Zack is here?
Uh... [groans]
I don't think I can actually say that.
You don't?
It's easy.
He's either here or he's not.
Yes or no.
No, but not no as in he's not here.
No as in...
I can't break the spoiler rule, man.
-Fuck.
-Okay, look.
Look, look, look.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not supposed to find him yet.
And if he were here, theoretically... you will.
Maybe.
[groans]
I wish I could say more.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay.
Off the record.
There are no leaders here, man.
Zack is doing his Rebirth just like everybody else.
Just like everybody else.
And when you're supposed to find him...
I'm gonna take you to a room you're gonna love, okay?
Spoiler curtain down.
You are gonna love it.
Man to man, no cameras, no bullshit.
You're gonna love this room.
Hey, guys.
This is Kyle.
He's a good friend of Zack's.
-[woman] Hi, Kyle.
-I love Zack.
[man] Welcome, Kyle.
I'm Gabriel.
Call me Gabe.
Come.
Join us.
This is Kyle's first Rebirth.
He's feeling a little overwhelmed.
He could really use some unconditional love.
Leave the door open.
Whatever makes you comfortable.
If anybody fucks with me again, I will call 911.
[all chuckle]
Deal.
[Gabe] Mm.
[woman] Mm.
-Welcome.
-Hi.
Okay.
That's all right.
Hi.
[Gabe] Kyle.
This circle is about honesty.
It's about saying whatever's on your mind right now, in the moment.
Okay.
Kyle, I feel like you're really nervous right now.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, yeah.
[Gabe] That's okay, that's okay.
Just tell us what you're thinking at this moment.
Now... be honest.
Okay.
Uh...
I think this whole Rebirth thing is pretty fucked up.
[woman 1] Mm.
[woman 2] Hmm.
[Gabe] Hm.
[all] Mm.
I remember feeling the exact same way.
-I totally empathize.
-Okay, thank you.
Is there something you wanna share with the group?
Nope, nope.
Everything's good.
It's all great.
Everything's great.
Thank you, that's fine.
Thank you.
Carry on.
You know, I don't--
I don't feel like you're being honest.
I don't feel like that, either.
Yeah, well, what do you want?
All we want is honesty.
Now, if you have to say something negative just be honest about it.
Okay.
I think this is a fucking joke.
I think you're all a bunch of arrogant assholes who think you're superior to everyone because... [chuckles]
I don't know, you're so open-minded, it'd be okay if someone shot you in the face?
And I'm fucking pissed I wasted a day I could've spent with my kid doing this hippie bullshit my friend, who I don't even really know is my friend, tricked me into.
And I don't know what this is, but I wouldn't be surprised if you dick-sacks are stealing my identity right now.
And I wanna go home.
Is that honest enough for you, Gabe?
I just wanna say that I'm really connecting to what Kyle is feeling right now.
Me too.
[Gabe] What's making you feel connected to Kyle?
I guess, his honesty about feeling like he doesn't belong, because I was feeling that way, too.
And I'm glad that someone just came in here and called everyone on their bullshit.
[Gabe] Mmm.
Kyle.
How do you feel about that?
Uh, good, I guess.
I'm feeling, like, a lot of anger out of you.
But, like, a lot of life, too,
-and I don't know, um... vitality?
-[Gabe] Mm.
-And I'm kind of really drawn to that.
-[woman 3] Me too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm feeling like this tractor beam of male energy... that I haven't felt anywhere else this weekend.
Can I say something weird?
Just stay in the moment.
I feel like, I go to these kinds of things a lot, and I meet a lot of guys who wanna be here.
But I never meet guys who should be here until now.
And this is probably terrible to say about a first-timer, but...
I probably shouldn't say it.
Just... tell the truth.
When I look at Kyle I see this huge, angry erect cock.
[women chuckling] [all chuckle]
Do you feel threatened by the cock?
How does the cock make you feel?
Happy.
Intrigued.
Okay.
Horny.
[Gabe] Kyle.
How do you feel hearing this?
Uh...
I-
- It...
Good.
This-
- I mean, it's nice.
Thank you.
-[Gabe] Is that all?
-I, uh...
Um...
I don't know.
Do you feel any shame having these women tell you how they feel about you?
No, no.
No, no, no.
I don't know, I don't know.
Oh, good, good.
Stay with that.
How about you, Betty?
What do you feel about Kyle right now?
I'm starting to feel really turned on.
I just wanna say that I'm feeling this amazing spontaneity in the room right now.
[all chuckle]
I feel like we're all on the same wavelength of breaking through our inhibitions and doing something really crazy, don't you, guys?
[all chuckling]
Do you feel like you're waiting for someone to take the first step?
-Kind of.
-[Gabe] Mm.
Kind of.
Man.
[Gabe] All right.
Now I wanna check back in with Kyle.
Kyle.
Kyle.
How are you feeling?
Do you feel safe?
Uh, heh...
Yeah?
[Gabe] Uh, you know that felt more like a question than an answer.
-Do you still wanna go home?
-Uh...
[Gabe] Hmm?
[man] Hello?
!
[Gabe] Kyle.
What would you like to have happen in this room?
-[man] Hello?
!
-I don't know, I don't--
Not sure.
[man] Hello?
[Gabe] Betty?
[man] Hello?
What do you want Kyle to do right now?
I want Kyle to fuck me.
-Really?
-Yeah.
[man] Please, please.
[Gabe] Kyle, do you wanna do that?
[man] Somebody help me!
Please.
I, uh...
What is--?
-[man] Please, somebody help me!
-Who is that?
What is that?
[man] You fucking sick motherfuckers!
All right, does anybody--?
Do you hear--?
Is that a thing?
Is that part of this?
Why do you think that person is your responsibility?
[man] This is so fucked up!
All right, all right, all right.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
-[woman] I know, right?
-Who is that?
Do you think that man's needs trump your own?
What is this?
Is this part of this?
Is this part of the thing?
You can't return to the same place twice.
[man] I'm being held against my will!
[Kyle] Jesus.
[man] Held against my will!
Anybody.
Anybody, please.
Who is that?
-[man] Can anybody fucking hear me?
-Hello?
What the fuck?
-Hello?
-[man] Oh, God, please!
What the hell is going on?
What do you think is going on?
-[man] Is someone out there?
-Who is that?
-Who do you think it is?
-Stop.
Stop.
-Stop with that shit!
-Stop what?
[man] Anybody, please.
Anybody.
Kyle, please stop.
He's fine.
-Open the door!
-[man] Is someone out there?
Okay, it's not what it looks like.
He knows he can quit any time.
[man] Hello?
!
Hello?
Hello?
Goddamn it, is this real?
!
Okay, the man behind this door is at a very delicate phase of his Rebirth.
-Shut up.
I don't wanna hear it!
-Okay, just stop.
I never told you about my life before Rebirth.
I don't care.
I could tell you I was a drug addict.
I could tell you that my kid was taken away from me.
I could tell you anything, but it doesn't matter.
What matters is I'm not the same person I used to be.
-[man] Please.
-I don't even know your name, lady.
Kyle!
Okay, I know this looks crazy, but he actually needs this.
Jesus, Zack.
-Zack?
-Stop talking to him.
-We need help.
-What are they doing to you?
It's okay.
I don't want you to talk to him.
We're getting help--
-Get out of here!
-It's okay, sweetie--
Shut up!
[grunts]
Okay.
I'm gonna get you down, all right?
Jesus.
Fuck.
Okay.
All right, all right, hold still.
Oh, I can feel your belly.
What the fuck happened to your pants, man?
-Ha-ha-ha!
-What the hell are you laughing at?
God.
What the fuck did they do--?
-Oh, fuck.
-Careful.
One of those buckets is my bathroom.
What?
Hey, did I, like, tell you how much it means to me
-that you came this weekend?
-Put this on.
-Okay?
Put this on.
-Is it time?
Is it T-shirt time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's T-shirt time.
Come on, come on.
Jesus Christ.
What are these, man?
Are these branding marks?
Those are my Rebirths, man.
Come on, come on, come on.
Jesse's trying--
Is helping break my attachments to the domination game.
To, like, the status thing.
You know what I'm saying?
-You're gonna put these pants on.
-No, no, no.
Put the pants on.
Put them on.
You were just screaming for help.
Why not?
[laughing]
No, no, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no.
No.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
[woman] Stop hurting him!
Stop hurting him.
Zack, are you okay?
Where's Jesse?
Is Jesse out there?
Naomi, just-
- Could you get Jesse?
-Could you get Jesse?
-Who the fuck is Jesse?
[Naomi] Jesse's coming, honey.
Hang in there.
Okay, thank you, Naomi.
All right, I hope you know that I have called the police, and they are on their way.
[Naomi] No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
-Fuck.
Hey, Kyle, Kyle, I...
-Oh, fuck.
[Zack squeals]
Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop.
What's wrong with you?
It's okay.
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's my supplements.
-Are they drugging you?
-No, no.
Not drugs.
They're supplements.
My God.
You're not gonna hurt Jesse, are you?
-You're not gonna hurt Jesse.
-You're drugging him?
How long have you been with these people?
-Uh...
-Huh?
That I don't-
- Because we jump around a lot, you know what I mean?
Because Je-
- Have you met Jesse?
Who the fuck is Jesse?
-[Naomi] Jesse's almost here.
-It's okay, it's okay.
Because this is my friend.
This is my best friend, Naomi.
Oh, God.
Wait, wait.
You're not-
- Hold on.
I hope the money--
-Is the money--?
Are you mad about--?
-What do you mean?
What money?
[slamming on door]
What money?
Jesse says that money is just a construct, too.
-So, it's fine, it's fine.
-No, no, no.
They didn't make you give them your money.
No, no, no, not my money.
Your money. [chuckles]
What do you mean, my money?
What are you talking about?
What does he mean, my money?
[Naomi] You shouldn't be talking to him right now, asshole.
What do you mean, my money?
What have you done?
-What did you freaks do to my money?
-You're doing it!
What did you do?
What have you done to me?
What did I--?
What...?
[man whistles] [man] Zachariah, are you there?
-Jesse!
-Okay, why are--?
Come on.
-Jesse.
-Aah!
[grunting]
-I come in peace.
-Aah!
No, Kyle, no!
-No!
-Zachariah, stop it.
Your friend can't help it.
He's not a Birthling.
What did we talk about?
Your friend is not a Birthling.
You can't be expecting him to have the insight--
Sir, I believe in a peaceful revolution through massage and the--
Stop it!
Stop with your brainwashing bullshit.
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you.
What the fuck is this, huh?
Cupcakes?
What the fuck is going on?
!
Aah!
-[Zack] Jesse!
Jesse!
-No, no, no.
No, we've seen your friend.
Now we're leaving.
No, no, no.
Let him help you.
Tell me what your body's feeling.
Tell me what your body's feeling.
-Please, please.
-Every cell in your body has been trained by millions of years of evolution to fight, to survive.
What you're feeling now is real life.
Don't you feel it?
[Jesse] You're just not used to such a pure dose.
Your mind's reacting.
Shut up.
My friend was shitting in a bucket, screaming for help!
[Zack] No, no, you're hurting Jesse.
-[Naomi] Knock it down, knock it down.
-That was real.
Do it again.
[banging on door]
-No, no, hit me again, please.
-Do it again.
-Stop it.
-No, hit me.
-Shut up.
-Hit me again.
-[Naomi] Just knock it down!
-Stay out!
-Stay out!
-Knock it down!
Hit me again.
-They're coming!
-Back off, I'll do it.
I'll fucking do it.
Come on, Zack, let's go.
It's okay, it's okay, Kyle, okay?
-We still love you.
-[Jesse] Zack?
Kyle's the master now.
Do what he says.
-[Zack] Okay.
-This is it.
-Can you feel it?
-[laughs] Yes, I can feel it.
Shut up!
Back off.
Zack, let's go, move.
All right, everybody back off, or I will kill him!
Do it, man.
Do it.
Shut up, man!
-Go, go.
Get back, get back.
-Okay, okay, no one's gonna get hurt.
-Kill me now, master.
I'm ready to ascend.
-That's enough, Jesse.
Stop it.
[laughing]
I think we got a situation here.
You need to kill that footage now.
Go.
[Kyle] Where do we go?
Do we go down?
Where the fuck do we go?
Zack!
[Naomi] We got a breach!
Breach!
[Naomi] Okay, Zack, I need to know what you've told him.
Don't talk to her, Zack, all right?
He didn't tell me nothing, okay?
We just wanna get on that shuttle and go home.
Where the fuck is the exit?
!
Sir, sir, you know this is not real, right?
-Shut up, shut up.
-Okay, all right, what's your name?
-What's his name?
-Kyle-something.
-This guy is having a psychotic episode.
-Yeah, no shit.
-Can we get a doctor over here, please?
-Yeah.
[Kyle] How do you get out of here?
Hey, honey, the exit is this way, where it's always been.
Found a doctor.
Okay, sir, can we just stop moving for a second?
[Naomi] Okay, everyone.
Just stay calm.
[doctor] Sir, what's your name?
-What's his name?
-Kyle.
-It's Kyle.
-[doctor] Okay, Karl.
I'm a psychiatrist at First Memorial.
I'm here for the seminar, like you.
You just tell him to stop whatever the fuck he's trying to do.
-Just let us go, all right?
-No-- No problem.
Some people's brains have a hard time adjusting to Rebirth.
So, just breathe.
They're trying to lock you back in their cage, master.
-Don't listen to them.
-[Naomi] Shut up, Jesse.
-[man 1] I think he went to the Wish Room.
-Yes, he did.
I took him there.
-[man 1] Jesus Christ.
-That's it.
That's the door.
-That's the door.
-Are you sure?
-Stand back, stand back.
-[man 2] Stay.
-Easy.
-Open the door, Zack.
Get over here and open the fucking door.
-It's locked.
-[doctor] Listen.
If you go back into the real world without decompressing, you're gonna have a serious brain damage- [Kyle] Shut up!
-It's not a door.
It's a wall.
It's a window, open it.
Shut up!
Everyone shut up and just let me think!
[panting]
[Kyle grunting] [panting]
No.
Hey, Karl, Karl, don't do it, man.
Karl, don't do it, man.
Don't do something you're gonna regret.
-[man] Come back home.
-It's a stupid thing to do.
It's a stupid thing to do.
-Karl, don't do it--
-Shut up!
Nobody fucking move.
Zack.
Let's go.
Zack, let's go.
All right, move.
[Kyle] Hello?
Hello?
!
Hello?
!
Oh, my God.
I'm so fucking hard right now.
God, fuck.
[gasping]
[Kyle panting] [gasping]
Zack!
[all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Aah!
Zack!
Zack!
[yelling]
[all cheering] [yelling]
[gasps] [speaking indistinctly]
It's okay, really.
-What's going on?
-That's not funny.
What the fuck is going on?
Told you, man.
Zack!
Welcome home, brother. [laughing] [all chanting] Kyle!
Kyle!

No, no, no!

[all] Yeah!
Whoo!
[all] Whoo!
Oh, shit, man. [laughing]
Hey, everybody.
Let's show my boy Kyle some Rebirth love.
[all cheering]
-What--?
-What do you think, man?
What do you think?
You think they like you?
[chuckles] [all laugh]
Hey, what some of you may not know--
What some of you may not know is that this man is like a brother to me.
And what you may also not know, is that this guy right here, is one of the main inspirations for all of this.
Huh?
[whooping and cheering]
-Whoo!
-[all] Yeah!
That's the man.
That's it.
Huh?
[man 1] Yeah!
[man 2] Yeah!
And you know what else?
I think this motherfucker just made Phase 2 in record time.
[all laugh]
-Right here, Phase Two.
-What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Yeah.
[man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Right?
-What the fuck are you doing?
-What's that, brother?
What?
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, man.
You just Rebirthed, you know?
You just Rebirthed.
That's a rush.
It's a rush.
It's just adrenaline.
It's just adrenaline.
Here, tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
-Tell the camera.
-No, no.
Tell the camera.
Tell the camera.
-No, no, no.
-Hey, hey, hey.
Don't fucking touch me.
Don't fucking touch me!
-Don't fucking touch me!
-Ease off.
Hey, hey, hey.
Kyle, this is the best part.
Hey, man.
It's over.
It's over, man.
-Don't touch me.
-[man] Kyle.
Kyle.
-Don't touch me.
-This is the best part.
Hey, let's get Kyle back, everybody.
-Kyle!
Kyle!
-[all] Kyle!
Kyle!
[all chanting] Kyle!
Kyle!
Kyle!
[birds chirping]
Hey, man.
Kyle.
Kyle, hey.
Kyle, come on, give me a chance--
Let me expl-
- It's over, man.
-Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go.
-Okay, all right, okay, no problem.
Take me to my car or I call the police.
[Zack] Kyle.
Nothing was ever gonna happen.
Nobody was gonna get--
Jesse's a stuntman.
He's, like, a black belt.
I did this...
I thought...
I thought you would dig it.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I don't wanna talk to this guy.
Can you shut the door?
-Can you shut the door?
-Are you coming on, sir?
No, he's not.
He's not.
Mary?
[line ringing]
[sighs]
Uh...
I'm done.
I'm done.
It's over.
Hey, where are you guys now?
[Mary] We're coming back from swim practice.
We're almost home.
Right.
Uh...
-Right.
Okay.
-Okay, bye.
[sighs] [cell phone dings]
No.
No.
No.

[panting] [water splashes]
Hey, there's my guy.
Got a towel, man?
Jesus, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
[grunts] Man, you know, after one of these weekends, it feels, like, a tour in Kabul, man.
I need me, like, a nice hot soak.
My wife is coming home.
This is my house!
I know.
It's nice, man.
Really digging the Jacuzzi.
No towel?
[whistles]
-Hey, guy, you need any help with that?
-What have you done?
-Why are you doing this?
-Because you're not finished.
Fuck you.
This, this is over.
Come on.
There's an after party at Jesse's.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God is right.
I mean, those sheets are amazing.
-What's the thread count on those?
-Mary is gonna be home.
Any second.
What else did you do?
I didn't do anything.
I've been in the bath the whole time.
Hey, man, do you mind if I put some tunes on?
I already guessed the Wi-Fi password was "Mumford." Heh.
[groans]
-Check it out, dude, you made the cover.
-Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Just stop.
Stop it.
Stop!
Why are you trying to destroy my life?
I'm not trying to destroy your life, man.
I'm trying to save your life.
I'm here to help you.
I don't want your help!
Oh, fuck!
What do you people want from me?
We want you to stop living your life like a spectator, okay?
[sobs]
That's it?
You all done?
All out of fight?
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Fuck the man.
Keep it real.
Don't be boring.
-What?
What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about you!
I'm talking about your dogma, dude.
The Manifesto?
Your words?
Do they mean anything to you anymore?
Oh, my God.
You mean, do I believe in a thing we wrote as a joke when we were 20 years old on shrooms?
[chuckles]
Yeah.
It wasn't a joke.
And you know it.
Stop.
Stop it, all right?
Just stop.
Just tell me what you want before Mary comes home.
I wanna help.
-You're destroying my life!
-You're destroying your life!
You're destroying it!
You sit all day at a job you fucking hate.
You bilk young kids out of money, so they're so immersed in debt that they're enslaved to the system for the rest of their fucking lives.
You can't get a boner, dude.
And you know what the worst part is?
You're really boring.
You're a child.
I'm not 20 anymore.
Thank you.
I know.
I am a child.
So, that way, I can see the world for what it really is, unlike the way the zombies have conditioned you to see it.
The zombies?
I'm an adult.
I have a family.
It's a fucking job!
Right, and I bet the only way to keep your child from starving is lying for a bank!
You have this juvenile obsession with what?
Am I the guy who created this system you hate--?
I don't give a fuck about the system, okay?
I care about you.
-Oh, my God, yes.
-Yeah.
-I can tell.
-Not this you, okay?
Not this you.
The you you used to be.
-Before the fucking lobotomy.
-I like my life.
Oh, do you like your life?
I like my life.
You should fucking love your life, Kyle.
You should've seen your eyes.
You should've seen your eyes when I described this weekend to you.
It was like I was offering you, like, a drop of water and you were just dying of thirst.
No.
I didn't know what it was.
It was called Rebirth!
What'd you think that meant, huh?
It means being born again.
It means a new life.
And that also, Kyle, means killing the old one, you understand?
This is also why we had to drain your savings account.
No, no, no.
That was not real.
That was a fake site.
Mm.
It was real.
It's all real.
[car horn honking]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
-Just relax.
Relax.
Relax.
-Oh, my God.
Nothing is gonna happen, Kyle, okay?
I'm gonna set you free.
All right, what do you want?
How do I make this stop, all right?
What do you want from me?
What do I want from you?
What do you want from you?
I want the same thing.
I want you to reach enlightenment.
Yes.
Okay, I'll do anything you want.
Just don't do this to my family.
Okay, in order for it to stop--
Right?
You have to tell me that you felt something at Rebirth.
Yes, yes, yes, I felt something.
-Okay, good.
What'd you feel?
-Uh...
I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?
-No, no, it has to be in your own words.
-Oh, fuck.
Just tell me what you wanna hear.
Okay, close your eyes.
Just close your eyes and tell me the truth, brother.
[panting]
-I felt scared, all right?
-Good, good, good.
-I felt like I was gonna die.
-Great.
I feel like I've been through a fucking war.
Yes. [laughs] [smooches]
That's all I wanted to hear.
That's it. [laughs]
-That's it?
That's it?
That's it?
-Yeah, man.
You've seen the other side.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-You can go back to your desk and tweet, twat, whatever the fuck you've been doing for the rest of your life.
But nobody, nobody's gonna take the moment away from you when you held a knife to a cult leader's throat and busted your way out of a sex dungeon.
[both laughing]
-Huh?
-Right.
Right.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
And the sex dungeon part.
-That's over, too, right?
-It's over.
I promise.
-[Mary] Hello.
-Hey, we're in here.
I promise, man.
Okay?
You just gotta make a little donation.
[gasps]
Zack.
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.
[Zack] Oh, man.
Is this crazy or what?
-Oh, boy.
[Mary] So crazy.
Wow.
Look at you.
Oh, man, you look amazing.
-Thank you.
-Ha-ha.
-You guys look sweaty.
-Oh, yeah.
We're guys.
-How long's it been?
-I don't know.
I mean, long enough for you two lovebirds to have a little one, right?
-Right.
Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.
Hey, Jill, come meet Mom and Dad's friend.
No, no, no, wait.
No, no, no.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Zack was just about to leave.
-Whoa.
No, no, no, I'm dying to meet her.
-Yay.
Let me get her.
-Great.
Wow, she's looking good, man.
-What do you mean, a donation?
You know, a meaningful donation.
I mean, we are a non-profit.
-Like money?
-Yeah, money's good.
-How much money?
-Some money from your bank would be nice.
I don't have access to my bank's money.
Oh, sure you do.
I write tweets to idiots who follow a bank on Twitter.
-I don't have acc--
-All you gotta do is log on to your bank's server from your computer, okay?
The algorithm will do the rest.
-What algorithm?
-Don't worry about it.
Her Highness is on her way down.
[chuckles]
Hey, so, I watched some of the videos from Rebirth.
What?
Just the ones that you e-mailed me.
What?
E-mailed?
Yeah, with the testimonials or whatever.
It actually looked kind of intriguing.
-You're not supposed to do that.
-Oh, no.
No, no, it's okay.
Hey, hey, look, as long as we're breaking the rules here,
-I have some video of your boy.
-Oh!
-No, no, no.
-Wait, I wanna see it.
It's-
- It's embarrassing, really.
Right, and you can't share the weekend with outsiders.
Oh, wow.
-It already sounds like a cult.
-No, it's not a cult.
[both laugh]
I hear Kyle says that you guys go to a church.
[Mary] Yeah, we do.
-Yeah?
Oh, I mean, you guys should like-- I mean, you should come.
You know, they like people from, like, all different kinds
-of, you know, spiritual paths.
-She's not interested.
Actually, I don't know.
If you guys both really liked it,
-I'd be open-minded about it.
-She's not interested.
She's not gonna do it, okay?
Just leave us alone.
Kyle.
I think it's time you should leave.
Are you sure?
[Jill] Hey.
[Kyle] Hey.
Hey.
Hey, sweetie!
Jill, this is Zack.
Hi, Jill, it's so nice to meet you.
You are as beautiful as your mother. [laughs]
Hey.
Does anybody want any Kool-Aid?
There's still plenty left over from the seminar.
Huh?
-Sure, that'd be good.
-Yeah.
I know when I was a kid, I loved Kool-Aid.
Kids still like Kool-Aid, don't they, Jill?
-Okay.
-Yummy.
-Hey, she's not thirsty.
-Kyle, what are you doing?
-What are you doing?
-I'll do it, okay?
-I'll do it.
-Okay.
[Mary] Kyle, what's going on here?
No, this is...
This is over, all right?
All right, I'll do it.
Um...
I think Kyle had kind of an intense day, and I think he just needs a little decompression time.
Oh.
Uh...
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I was--
-No, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's not a big deal, okay?
Just stop talking.
All right.
Well, how about us guys take a little retreat to the man cave?
If that's okay with you young ladies?
-Sure, yeah.
-Yeah?
Okay.
Well, fantastic, let's do it, bud.
[Kyle] It's all right.
[Jill] Bye.
So nice to meet you.
[Kyle exhales]
[Zack] Hey.
So, Naomi's gonna shoot a little testimonial video, if that's okay with you.
So, I wanna be clear.
I'm not going to get in trouble, right?
Of course not.
You're my friend.
Are you sure?
We will never take enough to get detected, okay?
I promise.
This is a good thing, Kyle.
You have an insane amount of potential.
You're gonna be an integral part of this community.
You're gonna run our new Media and Communications Department.
You're gonna help us reach a whole new group of people.
Help us make this something really big.
Help me, Kyle.
Help us.
Help yourself. [chuckles]
Have some fun for once in your life.
I mean, the worst case scenario is you make a ton of money.
Dude, I guarantee you, in five years, you're gonna think this is the greatest thing that ever happened to you.
And... if you don't you can leave any time you want.
[Kyle] You know, before I found Rebirth, I was lost.
I really was.
And the worst thing was I didn't know I was lost.
I was bottled up, and it would come out in the dumbest ways.
Just basic stuff, like getting impatient with my wife, or spending all day long looking at my phone, and then getting mad in traffic.
[Mary] Kyle was a great husband, a great father, a great provider.
Um, but he just-
- He wasn't happy.
And it affected all of us.
I was living this default life that everyone around me assumed was the best life possible.
But it just wasn't making me happy.
And then I found Rebirth.
Hi, my name is Kyle Madison, and I wanna tell you my Rebirth story.
Oh, yeah.
I remember Kyle's first time at Rebirth.
He was like...
You know, he was like, "What the hell did I just get myself involved in?"
[Jesse] It was almost like watching a game show where you already know that the contestant's won a million dollars, but they don't know yet.
Kyle.
His first time, you know, he was so sweet.
He was so open and fragile.
I just wanted to give him a massive Rebirth hug and be his mommy.
Everyone who was there was like, "Yup, scared that one off." [laughing]
I mean, I honestly never thought I was gonna see this guy ever again.
[sighs]
Hi, my name's Kyle Madison, and I just finished my first Rebirth.
Is that all right?
[man] The next weekend, he comes back.
So, I'm like, "Okay."
Weekend after that, we were in Cincinnati and Kyle flies in.
And, you know, that was it, that's when I knew that this guy was totally hooked.
I mean, his Z.W. potentials just exploded.
Kyle had been on my team for, like, five years, I think.
But he was one of those guys who's always in the back.
A nice guy, but never really initiated, you know?
Uh, but then, one Monday morning, he came in, and it was like bam!
You know?
[laughs]
Who is this guy?
Suddenly, I had Mark Zuckerberg working for me, you know?
-Kyle's the man.
-The man's a god.
It just brings clarity.
That's all.
There's the world before Rebirth and the world after.
Everything unimportant just falls away.
You look at the world and you just see reality.
Just like that.
He's killing everyone with his perspectives.
Just murdering them.
And finally, I was like, "Hey, what's the secret?" You know?
And he looks at me, and he says, "What are you doing this weekend?"
Give it up for Chad!
[all cheering] [laughing]
Right?
I knew he'd love it.
Pretty soon, the whole team loved it.
Then the whole company loved it.
[chuckles]
We're basically the Rebirth branch of Wall Street now.
What Rebirth did for me was...
It didn't just show me how to escape the cage I'd built around myself it actually showed me that the cage existed in the first place.
[Kyle] The first time my wife did her own Rebirth,
I was a little nervous, I'll admit.
[chuckles] But that's because I was clutching on to these zombie ideas of control, mastery and conditioned attachments.
And what you learn is your marriage only hits the stratosphere when you're both free to fly.
What people don't realize is Rebirth is not just something you do one weekend a month.
It's a lifestyle.
Right, Jill?
We want our friends to do it.
We want our parents to do it.
Our nanny, our neighbors.
We definitely want our pastor to do it.
[Mary] I want my brother to do it.
-I want my mailman to do it.
-[Kyle] Ha-ha-ha.
I couldn't wait to get our kids to do it.
Sometimes you're there to help a couple fetuses burst out of the womb and find the warrior within.
Sometimes, you think you're there to deliver the fetus, only to find out you're the fetus and they're there for you.
It's like every time you go to Rebirth, you're a different person.
So every Rebirth's different.
You never know what you're gonna find behind a new open door.
It's not just the workshops.
It's not just the Phase Two Life Activation Experience.
It's also the products.
[Mary] We don't even use the word "sell" in Rebirth.
Because once you realize how much better Rebirth's products are than what you get in the store, it just-
- It sells itself.
[Kyle] It's healthy.
It's natural.
It's good.
None of this processed crap.
[Mary] Jill is at an age where she's so picky about what she eats and she loves the stuff.
I don't know what they put in it.
-Tell them your first Rebirth, babe.
-Oh, yeah.
[Kyle] Heh.
You weren't breathing properly.
You can breathe with your nose, you can breathe with your mouth.
But there are other ways to breathe.
Everybody knows there are no leaders at Rebirth, because only you can change your life.
But... [chuckling]
But we all know who that spark was.
[crowd cheering]
Zack 110 percent changed Kyle's life.
And mine too.
In the old days, people were afraid something horrible would happen to them.
Now they're afraid nothing will happen to them.
If Zack hadn't come into my life when he did...
I really don't like to think about it.
I really don't.
[Mary] Zack is just one of those magical beings who can walk up to a stranger, look her in the eye and just immediately knows her deepest, most intimate needs.
Zack was like a brother to me and now that we share Rebirth, he's like a big brother. [chuckles]
-He's the big brother to us all.
-Yeah.
[cheering]
You know, when I started Rebirth in my garage, you know, building it out one weekend at a time to the global force for good that it is today that was the easy part.
You know?
Why I get out of bed every morning is knowing that there's other Kyles out there.
You know what I mean?
You see him at the grocery store.
See him at the gas station.
The drugstore.
[grunting]
Right?
See him on the highway. [whistles]
Going to work.
Going home.
Going to work.
Going home, you know?
Doing the Z.B. Zombie Boogie.
But if you look him them the eye, man, you'll see that they're dying, dying for something better.
They know it's out there.
They just don't know what it is, you know?
So, let's bring him up here.
Kyle Madison, everybody.
Come on, man.
[Zack] Sometimes, uh, I feel like a hunter. [chuckles] [laughing]
I got my gun, I got my bush hat on, and I'm stalking through the suburban savannah, searching for my prey and it's my job never to sleep, okay?
It's my job never to take a break, never to stop, man, until I share this with each and every Kyle.
It's an obligation.
It's a duty.
Whew. [chuckles]
Oh, man.
That's what gets me going.
Hmm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That's what Rebirth means to me.
[crowd cheering and whistling]
[all chanting] Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Rebirth!
Ooh!
You got an interview, church or a funeral?
I'm trying to catch Abby before she goes to work, ask her on our first official date.
Mmm.
I'm gonna file that under "funeral."
I'm even wearing the Dockers that make my butt look good.
Either that or my butt makes these Dockers look good.
- Kind of a chicken or egg thing.
- Mmm-hmm.
If the chicken has a hot ass.
Plus, I'm wearing my lucky shirt.
Why is that your lucky shirt?
Wearing this the day I made the Buffalo Bills practice squad.
You were cut the next day.
I wasn't wearing the shirt the next day.
Also, I wore it during my public intoxication hearing.
You were found guilty.
I got probation.
It's just a fancy word for innocent.
What are you doing?
Checking out a website for bull semen.
Shouldn't you be doing something work-related?
Dad's looking to improve the genetics of the herd, so I figured I'd check out other options.
Check it out, man.
It's like Tinder for bulls.
Ooh!
Boy, look at that cowboy, Troy.
Yeah, but you got to check out Big Dennis, huh?
We should be calling him "Very Big Dennis."
Yeah, but look at the scrotum on Troy.
Dude, the scrotum on Dennis is massive, man.
Think about the amount of semen that thing's gonna churn out.
This why my computer has so many pop-ups?
Hey, Dad, you gotta check this out.
Yeah, nothing like checking out scrotums with my sons.
We're looking at a new supplier for bull semen.
I'll take care of that.
Right, you'll do it, because if we do it, we'll just screw it up, right?
When he dies, he's gonna come back from the dead to haunt us.
Just to tell us what a half-ass job we did burying him.
"You call that a grave?"
That stuff costs over $200 a shot, from the bulls with the best genes.
I'm not gonna trust you two with my semen.
Come on, man.
I wasn't gonna laugh, but then you started laughing!
I wasn't gonna laugh...
Nah, you started smiling.
No, you had a little crinkle
- in the corner.
- No.
No.
That's what I'm talking about.
You can't even talk about it, let alone do it.
- Hey, Mom.
- Mom?
Hey, boys.
You, uh, spend the night?
Yep.
Uh... you moving back in?
No.
We're getting a divorce.
I'm starting to think this ain't my lucky shirt.
Colt, what are you doing here?
I couldn't sleep last night.
I was...
I just kept thinking about what we talked about.
Okay.
I told you I was gonna prove to you how much you mean to me.
At 6:30 in the morning?
6:30, noon, 3:00.
Whatever it takes.
We couldn't have started at 3:00?
Nope, this couldn't wait.
You're looking at the new Colt.
The Colt that's gonna win you over.
Got you... your favorite flowers.
Oh, my God, those are lilies.
I'm allergic to lilies.
I knew I remembered lilies for a reason.
Just...
You know what?
Okay.
There we go.
All right, that new Colt starts now.
That was a very sweet gesture.
Thank you.
Abby... you're the best thing in my life.
And I know I'm not gonna win you over in a day, but I'm gonna try... every day until I do.
Means a lot that you said that.
- Being the case...
- Wait.
Colt, hold on.
Whoa, relax, if I was proposing, we'd be in a luxury suite at Talladega.
Abby Gail Phillips... will you go out with me?
Wait.
Do you think my middle name is "Gail"?
Yeah, that's what your Mom called you when she was mad at you.
"Abby Gail, get in here."
My name's Abigail.
That's what I said.
Abby Gail.
No.
It's one word.
Abigail.
Huh!
That's...
Well, the new Colt starts now.
I would love to go on a date with you.
Fuck yeah!
But I gotta get going.
I'm gonna be late for school.
All right.
All right, you get going.
Get yourself ready for something classy.
I hope you like lobster.
Red Lobster.
Allergic to shellfish.
The new Colt starts at the Outback Steakhouse.
So, how you boys doing?
Dad won't let us buy semen.
Wow.
Where to begin?
Bull semen, Ma.
We wanna be in charge of inseminating the herd this year, and Dad's being an asshole about it.
It ain't just inseminating the cows.
We... we run into Ed Bishop the other day... and we were talking about doing a deal with Neumann Hill.
Dad won't even listen to our opinion.
It's the same thing he was doing when we brought up solar panels.
Same thing when we talked about expanding the herd.
- Same thing.
- Same thing when we talked about
- doing a kegerator on the porch.
- Same thing.
Well, hang in there.
It took me 40 years to figure out how to get along with him.
You're getting a divorce.
Yeah.
That's how you get along with him.
How you getting along with that, anyway?
All right.
It's tough to close that door, but I'm sure another one will open.
Knock, knock.
Ah, shit.
It's Kenny.
Boy, that's too bad.
Boy, that's too bad.
The hell are you doing?
Practicing for when he tells us about Abby.
Hey, Rooster.
Colt.
Hey.
Kenny, how you doing?
Ah, I'm all right.
Hey, uh, I don't know if you heard, but Abby and I broke up.
Boy, that's too bad.
Thanks.
Yeah, you know, whoever, uh, Abby ends up with next, man, that's gonna be a huge downgrade.
Yeah.
I don't know if he's gonna be a huge downgrade.
Oh, no, no.
He'll be a fucking idiot.
You guys wanna grab a table?
Uh, actually, you know, we gotta... we gotta get going.
Oh.
No, we don't.
Come on, man.
Our friend's hurtin'.
Why you gotta be such an asshole?
Oh, I don't "gotta be," I just enjoy it.
All right, Ken-Dog.
Give us the scoop.
It just... happened out of nowhere.
I mean, we were planning the wedding, we just sent out the save-the-date cards and... and what am I supposed to do now?
Send out "do whatever you want that date 'cause I'm not getting married" cards?
I mean, the worst part is, I don't even know why she did it.
Yeah, I find it's better to not know.
But the headline is "Move on."
I wish I could, but she's everywhere I look.
Last night, I come home from work, turn on the TV.
What's on?
A re-run of Downton Abbey.
Last week, I was Lady Mary, now I'm Lady Edith.
That's...
What the fuck channels you watch?
Hey.
You know what you need?
ESPN.
A guys' night.
Oh, that'd be cool.
I'm not gonna have a bachelor party now.
Yeah, man.
Bachelor parties are overrated anyway.
I mean, once all the fun is done, you still gotta take that stripper to the Walgreens, wait for her to pee on a stick.
All right.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
How about this weekend?
Hell yeah, man.
We're gonna get fucking weird.
Yeah, we are.
You know, I...
You guys... you guys have fun.
It sounds awesome.
I got plans, so...
- What, you got a date?
- Yeah, Colt.
You got a date?
Do I?
Did I get a date?
No.
I mean, well, I got a, uh, date with a cow that needs inseminating.
I mean, not by me.
I mean, sure, I'm gonna put my arm up in there and...
Do the...
I got plans.
So...
Oh, come on, man.
A night of drinking without Colt Bennett?
That's like A Prairie Home Companion without Garrison Keillor.
What the fuck channels do you watch?
Oh, well, Jerry's here.
I can't believe this.
I didn't think I'd ever get a divorce.
I didn't think I'd ever let a lawyer on my property.
Hey, Maggie.
Good to see you.
Don't shoot, Beau.
Don't give me a reason to, Jerry.
- How are you?
- Good to see you.
Good.
- Whoa, huh?
- Yeah.
Any luck, my nuts will thaw by April.
I can't believe that it's been so long since I've seen you both.
Yeah.
God, remember how our boys loved playing together?
- Yeah.
- How are yours doing?
Yeah, well, um, Kevin is an orthopedic surgeon.
Thank you.
And, um, Brett, he is, uh, working in one of those, uh, start-up jobs in Silicon Valley.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
How about Colt and Rooster?
- The same.
- Oh.
Well, great.
Yeah, this shouldn't really take long, should be pretty darn easy.
I generally do wills.
But this is sort of like, you know, the death of a marriage, so...
If you don't like that, you're not gonna like any of my other jokes, either.
- I got one for you.
- Okay.
What do they call a lawyer at the gun range?
A target.
What do they call a lawyer that ruins your damn joke?
Well, you're...
How about a rancher that tells you the same damn joke every time he sees you?
All right, huh?
Okay.
Let's get down to some business here.
Um...
My understanding is that the bar will remain in Maggie's name.
And then, as... as far as the, uh, ownership of the ranch.
Maggie, you're just gonna sign your half over to Beau.
Actually, I've thought about it, and I want to give my half to Colt and Rooster.
You're gonna do what?
It's my half, and I want to give it to the boys.
I'd rather you gave it to the cows, they earned it.
You know, actually, you can leave money to an animal.
There is a cat in Grand Junction, that is worth almost half a million dollars.
I thought this was gonna be easy.
Well...
nothing with you is easy.
Nothing with me is easy?
I'll be lucky if you don't skip town in the middle of this conversation.
You know what?
I consider both of you to be friends, but you guys are not on the same page.
So I'm just gonna tell you this straight away.
If you can't settle this, you're gonna have to sell the ranch and split the money.
We're on the same page.
Just tell Maggie she can't give her half to the boys.
Except, actually, she can.
Oh, shut the fuck up, Jerry.
All right, I'm just gonna bill this as a half hour, and I will talk to you later.
No, no, Jerry, stay.
We have to get through this.
If he's not gonna leave, then I am.
I'll see you.
Yeah.
So, uh...
Which one is the doctor?
Uh, Colt or Rooster?
Rooster.
Dr. Rooster.
You know the best thing about these Dockers?
Stain guard.
You can spill pretty much anything on 'em, it just wicks right off.
Whoosh.
- No shit.
- Yeah.
Dude!
Now, you got beer nuts.
- Hey, guys.
- Oh-ho!
There he is.
Hey, and Colt's here.
And he's drinking again, and he's pissed his pants.
This is awesome.
What's going on?
Guys' night.
- Tonight?
- Oh!
Did I forget to mention that when I asked you if you had anything to do tonight and you said no?
- Definitely did not.
- Huh!
Guys' night!
Let's get weird.
- Oh, let's get weird.
- Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah.
Let's get weird.
Joke's on you.
Taught my dick how to drink beer.
All right, boys.
We're gonna play a little game called "Eraser."
Uh, how does it work?
Take a shot.
Okay.
- All right, now, who dumped you?
- Ugh!
Abby.
Take another shot.
- All right.
- Now, who dumped you?
- Abby.
- Drink.
Oh, guys.
I don't know if this is the healthiest way to process this, but I'm having a lot of fun.
Look, man, this is what you gotta do when you get dumped.
Or so I assume, you know, the Rooster's actually never been dumped.
Bullshit.
You've been dumped by a lot of girls.
None that I remember.
Thank you, Eraser.
All right, what about Suzy Gardner?
Oh!
Who's Suzy Gardner?
Oh.
Suzy Gardner, man.
She's a chick who broke up with me at the county fair.
Tell you one thing, if you're gonna cheat on your girlfriend, don't do it in a fun house.
She saw it in, like, 72 different mirrors.
I got dumped by a girl once,
I went to the bar, got so drunk the bartender had to take me home.
She stayed the night.
That's awesome.
I want to do that tonight.
Yeah, okay.
Maybe not here.
The bartender's our mom.
- Yeah.
- So, what do you want to do, Kenny?
Strip club?
Indian casino?
Gun range?
Oh, Indian stripper in a gun range?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Fine.
A "Native American" stripper in a gun range?
No, I know what I want to do.
It's crazy.
Illegal.
And something we'll remember forever.
I like the way this sounds.
- I wanna go to the high school.
- Yeah?
Break into Abby's classroom... and steal back my grandmother's Precious Moments collectible figurine.
Maybe we should just let him fuck Mom.
Chilly night.
Yeah.
Let's conserve our body heat by not talking.
I don't wanna fight.
No, you just want to take my ranch away from me.
That's not true.
I just think it's time that Colt and Rooster... play a bigger role around here.
You know, the other day, Colt was sleeping in late.
I went up to wake him up.
He was wearing a cucumber facial mask.
Said his skin dries out in the harsh winter air.
That's what I'm dealing with here.
I'm not saying they're John Wayne.
But they work hard... and they love this ranch every bit as much as we do.
And, by the way,
John Wayne wore makeup every day of his professional life.
The only way John Wayne had cucumber on his face is if he was punching a salad.
The boys act like children.
Well, if they do, it's because you made them that way.
No, no, no, don't lay that pile of shit at my boots.
Nobody forces them to stay out all night drinking, and then spend all day talking about it.
"Remember how much we drank last night?
It was badass.
Ha-ha-ha."
You know, you hardly let them do anything.
And when you do, you just tell them they did it wrong.
That's because they do it wrong.
How else are they gonna learn?
Kids grow up when they have to.
Like you did when your dad died.
Damn right.
And when he died, I had no idea what to do.
I just figured it out.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
You don't have to die and make them struggle like that.
Teach them.
Yeah...
I think I'll just die.
You know, you talk so much about tradition and how badly you want this ranch to stay in the family.
And yet, you're not willing to do the one thing that will make that happen.
Oh, believe me, Maggie, when I'm gone...
I'd love nothing more than to look down and see them running this place the right way, but I'm not gonna hold my breath.
How sweet, Beau... that you think you'll be looking down.
Yeah.
This one's Abby's.
Come on.
Well, this is different.
Sneaking into a school.
Wait, hang on.
We forgot about Jack.
Leave no man behind.
It's so weird being drunk in a high school classroom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Totally.
It's...
Look, they're studying the War of 1812.
Yeah, most people don't know how closely that's tied to the Napoleonic War.
What?
I know things.
Look at this.
Classic Abby.
All the pens lined up, ready to go.
So organized here, yet at home, none of our chip bags have chip clips.
None of 'em!
Let it out, Kenny.
Let it out.
You know, before we grab that figurine, let's, uh... let's break some stuff!
Yeah, Kenny's a badass.
Or... or we could go to other classrooms and break stuff in there, and then she's gotta deal with her angry co-workers.
She ain't gonna like sitting in the teachers' lounge on that day.
All right, all right, um...
Well, come on, guys.
We gotta do something.
Like...
- Uh, what are you thinking?
- Uh...
Ooh, let's rearrange the order of the presidents!
All right.
Yeah.
Hey, put that Johnson in between those two Bushes.
Guess what, Millard Fillmore?
You are no longer the 13th president, you are now the 32nd.
Let's see you electrify America's rural homes.
Yeah!
Yeah, man.
That's real fun.
Hey, you know what else you can do?
Take a shit in her desk.
- Yes.
- Dude.
Hey, all right, all right...
Nobody's shitting on anything.
Come on.
Oh, man.
Look at this.
It's a picture of when we stayed at the Disneyland Resort.
She told me she always wanted to go, so I saved up for six months to take her.
It was our four-year anniversary.
Why would she do this?
We were so good together.
We never fought.
She was my best friend.
Let's just grab this figurine and get on out of here, huh?
When Meemaw gave this to me, she said...
"Give this to the woman who holds the key to your heart."
Well, I did it, Meemaw.
And she broke that heart in half.
You know who'd like that story?
Native American stripper with an Uzi.
Meemaw had an expression.
She'd say, "When you find something you love... nothing can keep you from it."
I mean, she was referring to her cigarettes, but it still applies here.
Maybe... maybe Abby was just freaked out about the wedding.
But we don't have to get married, we just...
We need to go back to the way things were before.
Kenny... it's time to move on.
No.
No, Abby's my soulmate.
Hey, hang on there, Ken-Dog.
You know, here's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking we grab this... this figurine, and we go buy some beers, and maybe some chip clips.
And we can eat as few chips as you want.
You know what I mean?
It'll be awesome.
I appreciate this, you guys are really good friends.
But, uh...
I'm going over there.
I'm gonna get her back.
Kenny.
She broke up with you to be with me.
What?
Yeah, what?
We are both reacting to this news right now.
You and Abby...
- Oh, my God.
- Kenny.
Kenny.
We... we didn't... plan on it, it just... kind of happened.
Just kind of happened?
What the hell are you talking about?
That doesn't just happen!
I'm really sorry, Kenny.
No...
You're not sorry.
This is who you are.
Everybody told me, "Don't let Colt Bennett near your girlfriend."
And I was like, "No, no, you don't know him.
He's a good guy.
He's my friend."
Fuck you, Colt.
I'm really sorry.
You know what makes this even worse?
Is that you're just gonna blow it.
Just like every other relationship you've had and when that happens... you'll have ruined my life and Abby's life for nothing.
I hope you're happy.
How could you tell him?
I had to.
He was on his way over here to beg to get you back and, uh, I...
I felt guilty.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, are you gonna put a chip clip on that bag?
'Cause them chips are gonna go stale.
Damn it, Colt.
Do you know what this means?
Everyone in town is gonna think I was hooking up with you while I was engaged to him.
I might as well have a huge red "A" on my chest.
"A..."
for Abby?
No, The Scarlet Letter.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that is.
Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic novel about shame and degradation?
Don't anybody in this town have cable?
Abby, Abby.
Abby.
A year from now, no one's even gonna remember any of this happened.
They're gonna see us walking down the street and they're gonna be like,
"Oh, my God, there's Colt and Abby.
Boy, they're gonna have beautiful kids.
And look there.
There's Kenny and his accountant wife.
It's so great that she does Colt and Abby's taxes.
'Cause they're just such good friends.
Boy, everyone sure is happier this way."
Oh, my God, and my parents.
I mean, they already hate you so much.
Your parents love me.
No, they don't.
They're just polite.
And what are they gonna think when they hear that I broke up with Kenny, who they love, to be with Colt Bennett, who they hate?
Okay.
I get it, your parents aren't fans.
That's...
Are... are you having doubts about us?
No.
No.
Of course not.
- Just...
- Hey.
Hey...
We're the only people in this town that matter.
It's just you and me.
We're on an island.
- But we're on it together.
- And...
If you gotta wear a giant letter "A," then I'll wear one, too.
It'll stand for "Awesome."
It's gonna be okay.
You sure about that?
It's gonna be okay.
Promise.
Thank you.
Hey.
I just realized something.
What?
You better get to work early on Monday.
Why?
There's a bottle of Jack Daniel's under one of your kid's desks.
How was the rest of your night?
Hey, Pa.
You ever have that dream where you wake up naked in a classroom?
Yeah, I got it.
Dad, you cannot believe how much we drank last night.
It was badass.
I ever tell you about the day your grandfather died?
Oh, well, maybe not the best time for a drinking story.
That morning, an irrigation pipe burst.
I was on my way down to shut off the water and I heard a bull screaming.
He smelled a cow in heat and tried to jump the fence.
Got all tangled up in the barbed wire.
I had a pipe spraying water and a bull spraying blood.
'Bout that time, my old man showed up.
Started yelling'.
Telling me everything I was doing wrong.
He do that a lot?
Just about all the time.
But that day, it was the last thing I needed to hear.
So I said, "If you don't like the job I'm doing, fuckin' do it yourself."
And I jumped in my truck... drove to the bar and started drinking.
Couple of hours later, I come home... find my mother... sittin' on this porch.
Crying.
She said, "Your dad died."
He had a heart attack out in that field, finishing the job that I wouldn't.
Shit, Dad.
After that, I had no choice.
I had to become a good rancher.
You boys haven't had that chance.
You'd be better ranchers today if I had died 20 years ago.
Ain't true.
Yeah, it is.
It's about time I gave you boys more responsibility around here.
I'm putting you in charge of inseminating the herd.
- Yeah?
- Yep.
I think you'll do a great job.
Or you'll screw it up so bad, I'll have a heart attack and die.
Either way... not my fucking problem.
Ooh!
You got an interview, church or a funeral?
I'm trying to catch Abby before she goes to work, ask her on our first official date.
Mmm.
I'm gonna file that under "funeral."
I'm even wearing the Dockers that make my butt look good.
Either that or my butt makes these Dockers look good.
- Kind of a chicken or egg thing.
- Mmm-hmm.
If the chicken has a hot ass.
Plus, I'm wearing my lucky shirt.
Why is that your lucky shirt?
Wearing this the day I made the Buffalo Bills practice squad.
You were cut the next day.
I wasn't wearing the shirt the next day.
Also, I wore it during my public intoxication hearing.
You were found guilty.
I got probation.
It's just a fancy word for innocent. [Chuckles]
What are you doing?
[Sighs]
Checking out a website for bull semen.
Shouldn't you be doing something work-related?
[both chuckle]
Dad's looking to improve the genetics of the herd, so I figured I'd check out other options.
Check it out, man.
It's like Tinder for bulls.
Ooh!
Boy, look at that cowboy, Troy.
Yeah, but you got to check out Big Dennis, huh?
We should be calling him "Very Big Dennis."
Yeah, but look at the scrotum on Troy.
Dude, the scrotum on Dennis is massive, man.
Think about the amount of semen that thing's gonna churn out.
This why my computer has so many pop-ups?
Hey, Dad, you gotta check this out.
Yeah, nothing like checking out scrotums with my sons.
We're looking at a new supplier for bull semen.
I'll take care of that.
Right, you'll do it, because if we do it, we'll just screw it up, right?
When he dies, he's gonna come back from the dead to haunt us.
Just to tell us what a half-ass job we did burying him.
[imitating Beau] "You call that a grave?"
That stuff costs over $200 a shot, from the bulls with the best genes.
I'm not gonna trust you two with my semen.
- [both laughing]
- Come on, man.
I wasn't gonna laugh, but then you started laughing!
I wasn't gonna laugh...
Nah, you started smiling.
No, you had a little crinkle
- in the corner.
- No.
No.
That's what I'm talking about.
You can't even talk about it, let alone do it.
- Hey, Mom.
- Mom?
Hey, boys.
You, uh, spend the night?
Yep.
Uh... you moving back in?
No.
We're getting a divorce.
I'm starting to think this ain't my lucky shirt.
[theme song playing]
[doorbell ringing]
Colt, what are you doing here?
I couldn't sleep last night.
I was...
I just kept thinking about what we talked about.
Okay.
I told you I was gonna prove to you how much you mean to me.
At 6:30 in the morning?
[stammers] 6:30, noon, 3:00.
Whatever it takes.
We couldn't have started at 3:00?
[chuckles]
Nope, this couldn't wait.
You're looking at the new Colt.
The Colt that's gonna win you over.
Got you... your favorite flowers.
Oh, my God, those are lilies.
I'm allergic to lilies.
I knew I remembered lilies for a reason.
[chuckles]
Just...
You know what?
Okay.
There we go. [Chuckles]
All right, that new Colt starts now. [Chuckles]
That was a very sweet gesture.
Thank you.
Abby... you're the best thing in my life.
And I know I'm not gonna win you over in a day, but I'm gonna try... every day until I do.
Means a lot that you said that.
- Being the case... [grunts]
- Wait.
Colt, hold on.
Whoa, relax, if I was proposing, we'd be in a luxury suite at Talladega.
Abby Gail Phillips... will you go out with me?
Wait.
Do you think my middle name is "Gail"?
Yeah, that's what your Mom called you when she was mad at you.
"Abby Gail, get in here."
My name's Abigail.
That's what I said.
Abby Gail.
No.
It's one word.
Abigail.
- Huh!
- [giggles]
That's...
Well, the new Colt starts now.
I would love to go on a date with you.
Fuck yeah!
[Chuckles]
But I gotta get going.
I'm gonna be late for school.
All right.
All right, you get going.
[stammers] Get yourself ready for something classy.
I hope you like lobster.
Red Lobster.
Allergic to shellfish.
The new Colt starts at the Outback Steakhouse.
So, how you boys doing?
Dad won't let us buy semen.
Wow. [Sighs] Where to begin?
Bull semen, Ma.
We wanna be in charge of inseminating the herd this year, and Dad's being an asshole about it.
[stammers] It ain't just inseminating the cows.
We... we run into Ed Bishop the other day... and we were talking about doing a deal with Neumann Hill.
Dad won't even listen to our opinion.
It's the same thing he was doing when we brought up solar panels.
Same thing when we talked about expanding the herd.
- Same thing.
- Same thing when we talked about
- doing a kegerator on the porch.
- Same thing.
Well, hang in there.
It took me 40 years to figure out how to get along with him.
You're getting a divorce.
Yeah.
That's how you get along with him.
How you getting along with that, anyway?
All right.
It's tough to close that door, but I'm sure another one will open.
Knock, knock.
[Colt] Ah, shit.
It's Kenny.
Boy, that's too bad.
Boy, that's too bad.
The hell are you doing?
Practicing for when he tells us about Abby.
Hey, Rooster.
Colt.
Hey.
Kenny, how you doing?
Ah, I'm all right.
Hey, uh, I don't know if you heard, but Abby and I broke up.
Boy, that's too bad.
Thanks.
Yeah, you know, whoever, uh, Abby ends up with next, man, that's gonna be a huge downgrade.
Yeah.
I don't know if he's gonna be a huge downgrade.
Oh, no, no.
He'll be a fucking idiot.
You guys wanna grab a table?
Uh, actually, you know, we gotta... we gotta get going.
Oh.
No, we don't.
Come on, man.
Our friend's hurtin'.
Why you gotta be such an asshole?
Oh, I don't "gotta be," I just enjoy it.
All right, Ken-Dog.
Give us the scoop.
It just... happened out of nowhere.
I mean, we were planning the wedding, we just sent out the save-the-date cards and... and what am I supposed to do now?
Send out "do whatever you want that date 'cause I'm not getting married" cards?
I mean, the worst part is, I don't even know why she did it.
Yeah, I find it's better to not know.
But the headline is "Move on."
I wish I could, but she's everywhere I look.
Last night, I come home from work, turn on the TV.
What's on?
A re-run of Downton Abbey.
Last week, I was Lady Mary, now I'm Lady Edith.
That's...
What the fuck channels you watch?
Hey.
You know what you need?
ESPN.
A guys' night.
Oh, that'd be cool.
I'm not gonna have a bachelor party now.
Yeah, man.
Bachelor parties are overrated anyway.
I mean, once all the fun is done, you still gotta take that stripper to the Walgreens, wait for her to pee on a stick.
All right.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
How about this weekend?
Hell yeah, man.
We're gonna get fucking weird.
Yeah, we are.
You know, I...
You guys... you guys have fun.
It sounds awesome.
I got plans, so...
- What, you got a date?
- Yeah, Colt.
You got a date?
Do I?
Did I get a date?
[Stammers] No.
I mean, well, I got a, uh, date with a cow that needs inseminating.
I mean, not by me.
[stammering] I mean, sure, I'm gonna put my arm up in there and...
Do the...
I got plans.
So...
Oh, come on, man.
A night of drinking without Colt Bennett?
That's like A Prairie Home Companion without Garrison Keillor.
What the fuck channels do you watch?
[vehicle approaching]
Oh, well, Jerry's here.
[sighs]
I can't believe this.
I didn't think I'd ever get a divorce.
I didn't think I'd ever let a lawyer on my property.
Hey, Maggie.
Good to see you.
Don't shoot, Beau.
Don't give me a reason to, Jerry.
- [laughing] How are you?
- Good to see you.
Good.
- Whoa, huh?
- Yeah.
Any luck, my nuts will thaw by April.
[Jerry exclaims]
I can't believe that it's been so long since I've seen you both.
Yeah.
God, remember how our boys loved playing together?
- Yeah.
- How are yours doing?
Yeah, well, um, Kevin is an orthopedic surgeon.
Thank you.
And, um, Brett, he is, uh, working in one of those, uh, start-up jobs in Silicon Valley.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
How about Colt and Rooster?
- The same.
- Oh.
Well, great.
Yeah, this shouldn't really take long, should be pretty darn easy.
I generally do wills.
But this is sort of like, you know, the death of a marriage, so... [laughing]
If you don't like that, you're not gonna like any of my other jokes, either.
- I got one for you.
- Okay.
What do they call a lawyer at the gun range?
A target.
What do they call a lawyer that ruins your damn joke?
[chuckles]
Well, you're...
How about a rancher that tells you the same damn joke every time he sees you?
All right, huh?
[Chuckles]
Okay.
Let's get down to some business here. [Clears throat]
Um...
My understanding is that the bar will remain in Maggie's name.
And then, as... as far as the, uh, ownership of the ranch.
Maggie, you're just gonna sign your half over to Beau.
Actually, I've thought about it, and I want to give my half to Colt and Rooster.
You're gonna do what?
[Jerry clears throat]
It's my half, and I want to give it to the boys.
I'd rather you gave it to the cows, they earned it.
You know, actually, you can leave money to an animal.
There is a cat in Grand Junction, that is worth almost half a million dollars.
I thought this was gonna be easy.
Well... [scoffs] nothing with you is easy.
Nothing with me is easy?
I'll be lucky if you don't skip town in the middle of this conversation.
[sighs] You know what?
I consider both of you to be friends, but you guys are not on the same page.
So I'm just gonna tell you this straight away.
[inhales] If you can't settle this, you're gonna have to sell the ranch and split the money.
We're on the same page.
Just tell Maggie she can't give her half to the boys.
Except, actually, she can.
Oh, shut the fuck up, Jerry.
All right, I'm just gonna bill this as a half hour, and I will talk to you later.
No, no, Jerry, stay.
We have to get through this.
If he's not gonna leave, then I am.
I'll see you.
Yeah.
- [sighs]
- So, uh...
Which one is the doctor?
Uh, Colt or Rooster?
Rooster.
Dr. Rooster.
You know the best thing about these Dockers?
Stain guard.
You can spill pretty much anything on 'em, it just wicks right off.
Whoosh.
- No shit.
- Yeah.
Dude!
Now, you got beer nuts. [Laughs]
- Hey, guys.
- Oh-ho!
There he is.
Hey, and Colt's here.
And he's drinking again, and he's pissed his pants.
- This is awesome.
- [Rooster chuckles]
What's going on?
Guys' night.
- Tonight?
- [Rooster] Oh!
Did I forget to mention that when I asked you if you had anything to do tonight and you said no?
- Definitely did not.
- Huh!
Guys' night!
Let's get weird.
- Oh, let's get weird.
- Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah.
Let's get weird.
Joke's on you.
Taught my dick how to drink beer.
All right, boys. [Clears throat]
We're gonna play a little game called "Eraser."
Uh, how does it work?
Take a shot. [Sighs]
Okay.
- All right, now, who dumped you?
- Ugh!
[Groans] Abby.
Take another shot.
- All right.
- Now, who dumped you?
- Abby.
- [both] Drink.
Oh, guys.
I don't know if this is the healthiest way to process this, but I'm having a lot of fun. [Chuckles]
Look, man, this is what you gotta do when you get dumped.
Or so I assume, you know, the Rooster's actually never been dumped.
Bullshit.
You've been dumped by a lot of girls.
None that I remember.
Thank you, Eraser.
All right, what about Suzy Gardner?
- [chuckles]
- Oh!
Who's Suzy Gardner?
Oh.
Suzy Gardner, man.
She's a chick who broke up with me at the county fair.
Tell you one thing, if you're gonna cheat on your girlfriend, don't do it in a fun house.
She saw it in, like, 72 different mirrors.
[Kenny chuckles]
I got dumped by a girl once,
I went to the bar, got so drunk the bartender had to take me home.
She stayed the night. [Chuckles]
That's awesome.
I want to do that tonight.
Yeah, okay.
Maybe not here.
The bartender's our mom.
- Yeah.
- So, what do you want to do, Kenny?
Strip club?
Indian casino?
Gun range?
Oh, Indian stripper in a gun range?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Fine.
A "Native American" stripper in a gun range?
No, I know what I want to do.
It's crazy.
Illegal.
And something we'll remember forever.
I like the way this sounds.
- I wanna go to the high school.
- [Rooster softly] Yeah?
Break into Abby's classroom... and steal back my grandmother's Precious Moments collectible figurine.
[laughs]
Maybe we should just let him fuck Mom.
Chilly night.
Yeah.
Let's conserve our body heat by not talking.
I don't wanna fight.
No, you just want to take my ranch away from me.
That's not true.
I just think it's time that Colt and Rooster... play a bigger role around here.
You know, the other day, Colt was sleeping in late.
I went up to wake him up.
He was wearing a cucumber facial mask.
Said his skin dries out in the harsh winter air.
That's what I'm dealing with here.
I'm not saying they're John Wayne.
But they work hard... and they love this ranch every bit as much as we do.
And, by the way,
John Wayne wore makeup every day of his professional life.
The only way John Wayne had cucumber on his face is if he was punching a salad.
The boys act like children.
Well, if they do, it's because you made them that way.
No, no, no, don't lay that pile of shit at my boots.
Nobody forces them to stay out all night drinking, and then spend all day talking about it.
[imitating] "Remember how much we drank last night?
It was badass.
Ha-ha-ha."
You know, you hardly let them do anything.
And when you do, you just tell them they did it wrong.
That's because they do it wrong.
How else are they gonna learn?
Kids grow up when they have to.
Like you did when your dad died.
Damn right.
And when he died, I had no idea what to do.
I just figured it out.
[scoffs] But it doesn't have to be that way.
You don't have to die and make them struggle like that.
Teach them.
Yeah...
I think I'll just die.
You know, you talk so much about tradition and how badly you want this ranch to stay in the family.
And yet, you're not willing to do the one thing that will make that happen.
Oh, believe me, Maggie, when I'm gone...
I'd love nothing more than to look down and see them running this place the right way, but I'm not gonna hold my breath.
How sweet, Beau... that you think you'll be looking down.
[whispering] Yeah.
This one's Abby's.
Come on.
[Colt straining] Well, this is different.
Sneaking into a school. [Grunts]
[Rooster] Wait, hang on.
We forgot about Jack.
Leave no man behind.
[chuckling] It's so weird being drunk in a high school classroom.
[Rooster] Yeah. [Colt] Yeah.
Totally.
It's...
Look, they're studying the War of 1812.
Yeah, most people don't know how closely that's tied to the Napoleonic War.
What?
I know things.
Look at this.
Classic Abby.
All the pens lined up, ready to go.
So organized here, yet at home, none of our chip bags have chip clips.
None of 'em!
Let it out, Kenny.
Let it out.
You know, before we grab that figurine, let's, uh... let's break some stuff!
Yeah, Kenny's a badass.
Or... or we could go to other classrooms and break stuff in there, and then she's gotta deal with her angry co-workers.
She ain't gonna like sitting in the teachers' lounge on that day.
All right, all right, um...
Well, come on, guys.
We gotta do something.
Like...
- Uh, what are you thinking?
- Uh...
Ooh, let's rearrange the order of the presidents!
All right.
Yeah.
Hey, put that Johnson in between those two Bushes.
[Kenny] Guess what, Millard Fillmore?
You are no longer the 13th president, you are now the 32nd.
Let's see you electrify America's rural homes.
Yeah!
[laughing] Yeah, man.
That's real fun.
Hey, you know what else you can do?
Take a shit in her desk.
- Yes.
- Dude.
[stammers] Hey, all right, all right...
Nobody's shitting on anything.
Come on.
[Kenny] Oh, man.
Look at this.
It's a picture of when we stayed at the Disneyland Resort.
She told me she always wanted to go, so I saved up for six months to take her.
It was our four-year anniversary.
Why would she do this?
We were so good together.
We never fought.
She was my best friend.
Let's just grab this figurine and get on out of here, huh?
When Meemaw gave this to me, she said...
"Give this to the woman who holds the key to your heart."
Well, I did it, Meemaw.
[clicks tongue] And she broke that heart in half.
You know who'd like that story?
Native American stripper with an Uzi.
Meemaw had an expression.
[sighs]
She'd say, "When you find something you love... nothing can keep you from it."
I mean, she was referring to her cigarettes, but it still applies here.
Maybe... maybe Abby was just freaked out about the wedding.
But we don't have to get married, we just...
We need to go back to the way things were before.
[Colt] Kenny... it's time to move on.
No.
No, Abby's my soulmate.
Hey, hang on there, Ken-Dog.
You know, here's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking we grab this... this figurine, and we go buy some beers, and maybe some chip clips.
And we can eat as few chips as you want.
You know what I mean?
It'll be awesome.
I appreciate this, you guys are really good friends.
But, uh...
I'm going over there.
I'm gonna get her back.
Kenny.
She broke up with you to be with me.
What?
Yeah, what?
We are both reacting to this news right now.
You and Abby...
- Oh, my God.
- Kenny.
Kenny.
We... we didn't... plan on it, it just... kind of happened.
Just kind of happened?
What the hell are you talking about?
That doesn't just happen!
I'm really sorry, Kenny.
No...
You're not sorry.
This is who you are.
Everybody told me, "Don't let Colt Bennett near your girlfriend."
And I was like, "No, no, you don't know him.
He's a good guy.
He's my friend."
Fuck you, Colt.
[softly] I'm really sorry.
You know what makes this even worse?
Is that you're just gonna blow it.
Just like every other relationship you've had and when that happens... you'll have ruined my life and Abby's life for nothing.
I hope you're happy.
How could you tell him?
I had to.
He was on his way over here to beg to get you back
- and, uh, I...
I felt guilty.
- [sighs]
I'm sorry.
[stammering]
I'm sorry, are you gonna put a chip clip on that bag?
'Cause them chips are gonna go stale.
Damn it, Colt.
Do you know what this means?
Everyone in town is gonna think I was hooking up with you while I was engaged to him.
I might as well have a huge red "A" on my chest.
"A..."
for Abby?
No, The Scarlet Letter.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that is.
Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic novel about shame and degradation?
Don't anybody in this town have cable?
[Abby groans]
Abby, Abby.
Abby.
A year from now, no one's even gonna remember any of this happened.
[chuckles] They're gonna see us walking down the street and they're gonna be like,
"Oh, my God, there's Colt and Abby.
[stammers] Boy, they're gonna have beautiful kids.
And look there.
There's Kenny and his accountant wife.
It's so great that she does Colt and Abby's taxes.
'Cause they're just such good friends.
Boy, everyone sure is happier this way."
Oh, my God, and my parents.
I mean, they already hate you so much.
Your parents love me.
No, they don't.
They're just polite.
And what are they gonna think when they hear that I broke up with Kenny, who they love, to be with Colt Bennett, who they hate?
Okay.
I get it, your parents aren't fans.
That's...
Are... are you having doubts about us?
No.
No. [Stammers] Of course not.
- [sighs] Just...
- Hey.
Hey...
We're the only people in this town that matter.
It's just you and me.
We're on an island.
But we're on it together.
And... [stammers]
If you gotta wear a giant letter "A," then I'll wear one, too.
It'll stand for "Awesome."
It's gonna be okay.
You sure about that?
[sighs]
It's gonna be okay.
Promise.
Thank you.
Hey.
I just realized something.
What?
You better get to work early on Monday.
Why?
There's a bottle of Jack Daniel's under one of your kid's desks.
How was the rest of your night?
- [Rooster chuckles]
- Hey, Pa.
You ever have that dream where you wake up naked in a classroom?
[chuckles] Yeah, I got it.
[laughing] Dad, you cannot believe how much we drank last night.
It was badass.
I ever tell you about the day your grandfather died?
Oh, well, maybe not the best time for a drinking story.
That morning, an irrigation pipe burst.
I was on my way down to shut off the water and I heard a bull screaming.
He smelled a cow in heat and tried to jump the fence.
Got all tangled up in the barbed wire.
I had a pipe spraying water and a bull spraying blood.
'Bout that time, my old man showed up.
Started yelling'.
Telling me everything I was doing wrong.
He do that a lot?
Just about all the time.
But that day, it was the last thing I needed to hear.
So I said, "If you don't like the job I'm doing, fuckin' do it yourself."
And I jumped in my truck... drove to the bar and started drinking.
Couple of hours later, I come home... find my mother... sittin' on this porch.
Crying.
She said, "Your dad died."
He had a heart attack out in that field, finishing the job that I wouldn't.
Shit, Dad.
After that, I had no choice.
I had to become a good rancher.
You boys haven't had that chance.
You'd be better ranchers today if I had died 20 years ago.
Ain't true.
Yeah, it is.
It's about time I gave you boys more responsibility around here.
I'm putting you in charge of inseminating the herd.
- Yeah?
- Yep.
I think you'll do a great job.
Or you'll screw it up so bad, I'll have a heart attack and die.
Either way... not my fucking problem.

Look, I've heard everything you said and I'm trying.
I really want this to work.
It's just... it's really frustrating because I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
You've only been job hunting for two weeks.
I know, but I thought the last interview went well.
I mean, the VP went to Georgetown, too.
They had a ton of questions.
Mostly about the gaps in your resume.
They are tough to explain.
Look, I just need to get back on my feet, okay?
I can't keep living off unemployment.
Well, if you're pressed for income, you might need to take a step back.
- How far back?
- Something entry-level.
Or maybe hourly like tech support.
No!
Elise, why would I do that?
I'm still getting interviews.
You are.
I'm just saying it could take a while.
It's fine.
No, if it's the perfect job...
I can wait.
I keep telling Ashley we have a kid on the way.

Ken:
Well, I think Issa is just in over her head with Beach Day.
Sarah:
Can she even plan something like this?
Do they even have bus parking at the beach?
- I mean those...
- I know.
Ken:
Every time we go to the beach, it's a nightmare.
- Kitty:
Is the weather good?
- Ken:
The sand, the noisy children.
The kind of organization that goes into stuff like this...
- Hey, guys.
- Issa, hey!
Hey, how's Beach Day going?
How are you doing?
Are you so stressed?
I would be so stressed.
Like, so stressed.
Uh, it's great.
Thank you.
- Well, awesome.
- We are really looking forward to it.
- [overlapping voices]
- The kids are gonna have so much fun!
- Turnt up at the beach!
- Cute shoes, by the way.
So flattering.
Hey, Frieda, do you have a sec?
I have all the secs you need.
Nope.
I heard it.
Yep?
Um, were you guys discussing Beach Day?
Oh!
It's no big deal.
We were just talking, and a few of the others had some concerns.
Are they concerns that they couldn't talk to me about?
I'm sure they could've, but they just emailed me to double check a couple little things.
Wait, so there were emails, too?
I...
I wasn't cc'd.
Oh.
They didn't wanna seem like they were questioning your judgment.
But they weren't sure how you'd react.
But everyone knows this is your event and I assured them that you have everything covered.
You're like a toupee.
I'll see you later.
They're having secret white meetings and they're sending secret white emails.
I made one mistake during my presentation and they lost all faith in me.
You know, now I'm the black girl who fucked up.
And white people at my job fuck up all the time!
They didn't say shit to Caleb when he had the kids make those racist puppets.
Where are those emails?
I didn't get shit in my inbox.
- Look, did you talk to Joanne about it?
- No.
'Cause then I'll look too sensitive.
So fucking unfair.
I know, but, hey, you just gotta work extra hard to prove them wrong.
Yeah.
I'm about to plan the fuck out of Beach Day, though.
- I know that.
- There you go.
Those kids, they're not even ready for the ocean and shit.
- Nope.
- They're about to be swimming with sharks.
They're about to be slap boxing with seals.
- I swear.
- Um...
Let these white people doubt me again.
I'ma throw a kid in they face.
So, I...
I saw the headhunter again today.
- Oh, yeah?
How'd that go?
- It was all right.
She said even though I'm still getting interviews,
I need to be more open to entry-level positions, but I'm not trying to go backwards, you know?
I mean, she sounds kind of right, though.
Uh, but Elise did just email me about a possible interview tomorrow.
- Oh, that's cool.
- That's all you can say?
- What do you want me to say?
- I... [sighs]
Look, Iss, I know you've been busy, but I feel like the last couple of weeks, like...
I mean, just 'cause I'm back here doesn't mean everything's all good.
No, okay, I'm not saying that it's all good.
Ah, I knew I should've gotten something to eat before I got home.
These white people got me all "hangry."
- You want me to go get some food?
- No, thanks.
I told Molly I'd meet her at this stupid thing.
But you're coming home, right?
Like, don't let me catch you in the Rite Aid.
Too soon.
[music playing]
It's like, I just want him to know what he did to get us here.
All right, well, have you told Lawrence what your issues are with him?
Like, really spelled it out?
Because sometimes when you're really in it, it's hard to see shit clearly.
Yeah, but why do I have to be the one who sees shit so clearly?
You know, I love him, but it's hard to carry the emotional weight and the financial weight.
Like, those are heavy as fuck.
Are you sure it's all on him?
I mean, it does take two to make it or break it.
Bitch, you eating tacos with him or me?
You right, you right.
You can do no wrong.
Number 42, al pastor.
- Yeah!

All right, so Jared is coming through tonight.
Oh.
Rent-a-Boo is coming?
Why you clowning just 'cause he work at Enterprise?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
Did I Hertz your feelings?
I hate you.
It was funny.
I just need for you to just gauge to see if he's giving me friend vibes or fuck vibes.
You can't tell?
No.
Sometimes Jared is hella dodgy.
One day I think he's feeling me, and the next, I can't read him.
All right, fine.
Guess I'll sort this out for you just like I did for your gynecologist, which was friend vibes, by the way.
See?
God don't like ugly.
[grunts] Fuck these tacos!
Issa, you're littering!

Okay.
Oh, shit!
Look who dragged in the cats!
Kelli, how did your drunk ass beat us here?
I wasn't trying to miss open bar again.
You gonna use all your drink tickets?
'Cause I don't play.
Oh, you can have mine.
They're only serving Yellow Tail Shiraz.
And, Molly, I see these Fendis.
I got a problem!
- Converse.
- I got a problem.
- [all laughing]
- Ha!
I love how you just, like, don't even care, you know?
Molly, where's this new boo?
Is he coming or not?
Well, he's not a new boo yet.
That's why I just need y'all to gauge him for me.
You should let us hook you up with somebody.
Here we go.
Babe, tell her about when we hooked Kelli up with your coworker.
Okay, bitch, barely.
That white boy took me apple picking.
End of story.
- And then?
- Really?
Fine.
We fucked in the orchard.
End of story.
I'm so tired of LA men!
What?
What's wrong with dudes from LA?
Shit.
- Tiffany:
Oh.
- Guys, this is Jared.
- Hey.
What's going on, y'all?
- Hello.
- Good to see you again.
- Oh, you, too.
- You all know each other?
- Oh, we met at an open mic.
- Mm-hmm.
- Y'all know she was rapping on stage?
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't need to talk about this, guys.
Let's not even.
You're telling me this awkward bitch right here
- got up on stage and didn't fall off?
- [laughing]
Kelli, that's a drink ticket on the floor?
- Hold up, where?
- Classic Kelli.
- Always ready for a drink.
- Oh, classic Tiffany.
Your life is better than mine with your flawless-ass face and your perfect natural...
- Fuck you.
- [all laughing]
You guys, I'm tired and, you know... oh!
And I got a lot of work to do tomorrow, so I'ma get out of here.
Um, Issa, don't forget we need your money for Kelli's birthday trip.
Oh, let me get you on Friday.
- Okay?
Bye, guys!
- Yes.
- Skee-wop!
- Girl, don't be disrespectful.
Hey, was I not supposed to say anything?
Oh, you're fine.
- You look good, too.
- Shut up.
Girl, he is feeling you so hard
I could hang my coat on his dick.
Like, my heavy coat.
It's not even winter.
- A degree.
- I'm 100% right!
- Nah, nah.
- Come on!
There's my baby saving the day.
Okay, it's true.
Okay?
Once they get a degree, black men turn into the most "nigga-est" of niggas, okay?
- They act like prized possessions!
- Molly:
Right?
- I mean...
- Very important and very pretentious.
They act like women should be grateful for the opportunity to suck their dicks.
- Why not?
- Okay!
And then add to that being in LA where every dude thinks he gonna bag some exotic model or actress.
You know, that's why I appreciate New York men,
- because they way more straightforward.
- Molly:
Talk about it.
LA dudes do not approach black women.
- This is a fact.
- Jared:
Mm-mm, no.
- I approached you.
- Derek:
Ooh, see?
See?
- Black women are so quick
- Okay.
to write off all black men.
I mean, maybe that's why y'all are still single,
- because you're too damn difficult.
- Kelli:
Whoa, excuse me?
!
- Oh, okay.
- It could be that.
Just because we have standards does not make us difficult,
- thank you very much, okay?
- Thank you.
The reason why my baby and I work is because I let him be a man and he lets me be a woman.
- Bitch, I'ma call bell hooks on you.
- Call her.
Look, hey, but, Molly, you know what your problem is?
No, but I know you're gonna tell me.
Please enlighten me.
You always try to control shit, and men don't like that.
- You don't like that.
- They don't like it.
- He doesn't like that.
- I actually think it's kind of sexy.
Ooh, ooh.
Coat hanger.
[chuckles] Seriously, where are your friends?
Nah, see, I don't think they're your type.
- They're all LA dudes.
- I'll make that work.
- You went to college out here?
- Nah, I didn't go to college.
Kelli:
That's what's up.
- That's what's up.
- Oh!
- Derek:
Cool.
- That's... that's cool!
- Hey, you know, good for you, man.
- That's cool.
You know, college isn't for everybody.
Yeah, no, I don't feel like I missed out on anything.
- Just a degree.
- Except for all the grateful women apparently waiting to suck my dick.
- I would be, I would be.
- Nasty.
But, like, back to your friends, okay?
- Kelli.
- Like, what are some of their phone numbers?
- Like, off the top of your head?
- Mm, mm-mm.
Yeah, and I'm sorry about my friends.
They were a little crazy today.
- Nah, you still...
You can fit right in.
- Did I?
You were actually very comfortable in that room.
Is that a compliment or...?
It was fun.
- I had a great time with you.
- I did, too.
But please keep all of your friends away from Kelli.
- She's crazy.
- Nah, she was funny.
- And she kind of had a good point.
- About what?
That maybe sometimes guys aren't straightforward enough.
Oh.
I like straightforward.
I like you.
I like you, too.

I had a job interview.
Oh, okay, I see you.
Then let me go ahead and cash your last unemployment check.
Nah.
I didn't get the job.
Oh.
Well, then they stupid.
Okay?
You got a lot going for you.
[scoffs] Don't know about all that.
I do.
You a good black man.
You went to college.

Good 'cause, you know, I just wanna make sure that no one gets the wrong impression of you.
Um, why would they?
Mark said I was doing great.
Yeah, and you are.
I just... you know, sometimes you can be a little...
Girl, you know how these white people are.
If you wanna be successful here, you gotta know when to switch it up a little bit.
[exhales] Hmm.
- I appreciate your feedback.
- Good.
But I didn't switch it up in my interview with the senior partners and I didn't switch it up when I was named editor of the law review, so I don't think I need to switch it up now.
But thank you so much.
Okay, good.
'Cause I'm just trying to help.
Okay.
[girl screams]
Today was awesome.
Great job, Issa.
Thank you.
And I'm really sorry about the emails before.
I...
I take full responsibility.
- I shouldn't have let that happen.
- Hey, I appreciate it.
Actually, I'd really love to make it up to you.
Can I take you to drinks or something?
- Um...
- This was such a good idea.
The kids loved it.
They always trying to doubt us.
Beach, you ain't my friend just 'cause you brown.
Oh, shit went well, so now you wanna be down?
I overheard your ass on the bus trying to clown.
Get the fuck outta here or bow the fuck down.
Hey, could you hold this real quick, please?
- Yeah.
Oh.

Hey, you know what?
We should do drinks.
That sounds great.
Great, great!

Guess who got into The League.
Wait, didn't you say you were done with those dating apps?
No, no, I said I was done with shitty-ass dating apps.
Plus I've been waiting, like, three months to get approved for this.
Now I can finally date dudes on my level, girl.
- And they fine as fuck.
- But I thought you were feeling Jared.
I am!
But, girl, these League niggas have been vetted.
And Jared didn't even go to college.
Yeah, but you weren't even tripping about that before.
You act like these niggas are gonna disappear.
They will!
Ugh.

Issa.
Where have you been, huh?
- Oh, I...
I...
- Are you not coming home?
I just wanna up the quality of dudes that I meet.
There's this one app called The League.
It's for elite dating.
I've been on, like, a waiting list.
My idea is to expose them to the arts...
- Which arts?
- Like...
Wouldn't they rather go to an African American museum?
Oh, my God, what about hip-hop Shakespeare?
What if we just took these kids to the beach to start?
Make it a...
- beach cleanup.
- Beach cleanup.
- Oh, I was gonna read.
- Oh.
Uh, sorry.
I mean, I...
I could just go in the living room.
No, no, it's cool.
I could...
I could just, um... sleep with the light on.
Uh, I can just go to bed, too.
I'm good.
Ooh!
Sorry.
Your hands are cold.
Oh, my bad.
Probably all the snow cones I made.
Snow cones?
What?
No, I was...
I was just making a joke, or thought I was.
Oh.
Good night.
Look, I've heard everything you said and I'm trying.
I really want this to work.
It's just... it's really frustrating because I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
You've only been job hunting for two weeks.
I know, but I thought the last interview went well.
I mean, the VP went to Georgetown, too.
They had a ton of questions.
Mostly about the gaps in your resume.
They are tough to explain.
Look, I just need to get back on my feet, okay?
I can't keep living off unemployment.
Well, if you're pressed for income, you might need to take a step back.
- How far back?
- Something entry-level.
Or maybe hourly like tech support.
No!
Elise, why would I do that?
I'm still getting interviews.
You are.
I'm just saying it could take a while.
It's fine.
No, if it's the perfect job...
I can wait.
I keep telling Ashley we have a kid on the way.
- It's not the time to add a deck.
- Oh, come on.
You just got that big-white-guy bonus.
Hey, how'd you find out about those?
Oh, look, we got a new black law intern.
- Aw.
- Okay, now.
I don't see color.
I just see someone who's gonna fetch me coffee.
Hey, I'll catch up with you in just a bit.
- Okay, see you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi!
I'm Molly, one of the third-year associates.
Oh, look at you!
I like seeing us in high places, girl.
Oh, well, thank you so much.
But listen, I know everything is super new right now, so if you ever need anything, I can help.
Oh, thanks...
Molly.
- Yeah.
- I appreciate it.
- And...?
- Rasheeda.
But you can call me Dada, girl.
Okay.
Da... okay.
You know what, let me check on the head count and I will get back to you with a number.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Bye.
Well, I think Issa is just in over her head with Beach Day.
Can she even plan something like this?
Do they even have bus parking at the beach?
- I mean those...
- I know.
Every time we go to the beach, it's a nightmare.
- Is the weather good?
- The sand, the noisy children.
The kind of organization that goes into stuff like this...
- Hey, guys.
- Issa, hey!
Hey, how's Beach Day going?
How are you doing?
Are you so stressed?
I would be so stressed.
Like, so stressed.
Uh, it's great.
Thank you.
- Well, awesome.
- We are really looking forward to it.
The kids are gonna have so much fun!
- Turnt up at the beach!
- Cute shoes, by the way.
So flattering.
Hey, Frieda, do you have a sec?
I have all the secs you need.
Nope.
I heard it.
Yep?
Um, were you guys discussing Beach Day?
Oh!
It's no big deal.
We were just talking, and a few of the others had some concerns.
Are they concerns that they couldn't talk to me about?
I'm sure they could've, but they just emailed me to double check a couple little things.
Wait, so there were emails, too?
I...
I wasn't cc'd.
Oh.
They didn't wanna seem like they were questioning your judgment.
But they weren't sure how you'd react.
But everyone knows this is your event and I assured them that you have everything covered.
You're like a toupee.
I'll see you later.
They're having secret white meetings and they're sending secret white emails.
I made one mistake during my presentation and they lost all faith in me.
You know, now I'm the black girl who fucked up.
And white people at my job fuck up all the time!
They didn't say shit to Caleb when he had the kids make those racist puppets.
Where are those emails?
I didn't get shit in my inbox.
- Look, did you talk to Joanne about it?
- No.
'Cause then I'll look too sensitive.
So fucking unfair.
I know, but, hey, you just gotta work extra hard to prove them wrong.
Yeah.
I'm about to plan the fuck out of Beach Day, though.
- I know that.
- There you go.
Those kids, they're not even ready for the ocean and shit.
- Nope.
- They're about to be swimming with sharks.
They're about to be slap boxing with seals.
- I swear.
- Um...
Let these white people doubt me again.
I'ma throw a kid in they face.
So, I...
I saw the headhunter again today.
- Oh, yeah?
How'd that go?
- It was all right.
She said even though I'm still getting interviews,
I need to be more open to entry-level positions, but I'm not trying to go backwards, you know?
I mean, she sounds kind of right, though.
Uh, but Elise did just email me about a possible interview tomorrow.
- Oh, that's cool.
- That's all you can say?
- What do you want me to say?
- I...
Look, Iss, I know you've been busy, but I feel like the last couple of weeks, like...
I mean, just 'cause I'm back here doesn't mean everything's all good.
No, okay, I'm not saying that it's all good.
Ah, I knew I should've gotten something to eat before I got home.
These white people got me all "hangry."
- You want me to go get some food?
- No, thanks.
I told Molly I'd meet her at this stupid thing.
But you're coming home, right?
Like, don't let me catch you in the Rite Aid.
Too soon.
It's like, I just want him to know what he did to get us here.
All right, well, have you told Lawrence what your issues are with him?
Like, really spelled it out?
Because sometimes when you're really in it, it's hard to see shit clearly.
Yeah, but why do I have to be the one who sees shit so clearly?
You know, I love him, but it's hard to carry the emotional weight and the financial weight.
Like, those are heavy as fuck.
Are you sure it's all on him?
I mean, it does take two to make it or break it.
Bitch, you eating tacos with him or me?
You right, you right.
You can do no wrong.
Number 42, al pastor.
Yeah!
_
_
_
- Yes!
- Mm.
All right, so Jared is coming through tonight.
Oh.
Rent-a-Boo is coming?
Why you clowning just 'cause he work at Enterprise?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
Did I Hertz your feelings?
I hate you.
It was funny.
I just need for you to just gauge to see if he's giving me friend vibes or fuck vibes.
You can't tell?
No.
Sometimes Jared is hella dodgy.
One day I think he's feeling me, and the next, I can't read him.
All right, fine.
Guess I'll sort this out for you just like I did for your gynecologist, which was friend vibes, by the way.
See?
God don't like ugly.
Fuck these tacos!
Issa, you're littering!
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, you!
Skee-wee!
What's up, Iss?
- We're in here.
- Okay.
Oh, shit!
Look who dragged in the cats!
Kelli, how did your drunk ass beat us here?
I wasn't trying to miss open bar again.
You gonna use all your drink tickets?
'Cause I don't play.
Oh, you can have mine.
They're only serving Yellow Tail Shiraz.
And, Molly, I see these Fendis.
I got a problem!
- Converse.
- I got a problem.
Ha!
I love how you just, like, don't even care, you know?
Molly, where's this new boo?
Is he coming or not?
Well, he's not a new boo yet.
That's why I just need y'all to gauge him for me.
You should let us hook you up with somebody.
Here we go.
Babe, tell her about when we hooked Kelli up with your coworker.
Okay, bitch, barely.
That white boy took me apple picking.
End of story.
- And then?
- Really?
Fine.
We fucked in the orchard.
End of story.
I'm so tired of LA men!
What?
What's wrong with dudes from LA?
Shit.
- Oh.
- Guys, this is Jared.
- Hey.
What's going on, y'all?
- Hello.
- Good to see you again.
- Oh, you, too.
- You all know each other?
- Oh, we met at an open mic.
- Mm-hmm.
- Y'all know she was rapping on stage?
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't need to talk about this, guys.
Let's not even.
You're telling me this awkward bitch right here got up on stage and didn't fall off?
Kelli, that's a drink ticket on the floor?
- Hold up, where?
- Classic Kelli.
- Always ready for a drink.
- Oh, classic Tiffany.
Your life is better than mine with your flawless-ass face and your perfect natural...
Fuck you.
You guys, I'm tired and, you know... oh!
And I got a lot of work to do tomorrow, so I'ma get out of here.
Um, Issa, don't forget we need your money for Kelli's birthday trip.
Oh, let me get you on Friday.
- Okay?
Bye, guys!
- Yes.
- Skee-wop!
- Girl, don't be disrespectful.
Hey, was I not supposed to say anything?
Oh, you're fine.
- You look good, too.
- Shut up.
Girl, he is feeling you so hard
I could hang my coat on his dick.
Like, my heavy coat.
It's not even winter.
- A degree.
- I'm 100% right!
- Nah, nah.
- Come on!
There's my baby saving the day.
Okay, it's true.
Okay?
Once they get a degree, black men turn into the most "nigga-est" of niggas, okay?
- They act like prized possessions!
- Right?
- I mean...
- Very important and very pretentious.
They act like women should be grateful for the opportunity to suck their dicks.
- Why not?
- Okay!
And then add to that being in LA where every dude thinks he gonna bag some exotic model or actress.
You know, that's why I appreciate New York men,
- because they way more straightforward.
- Talk about it.
LA dudes do not approach black women.
- This is a fact.
- Mm-mm, no.
- I approached you.
- Ooh, see?
See?
- Black women are so quick
- Okay.
to write off all black men.
I mean, maybe that's why y'all are still single,
- because you're too damn difficult.
- Whoa, excuse me?
!
- Oh, okay.
- It could be that.
Just because we have standards does not make us difficult,
- thank you very much, okay?
- Thank you.
The reason why my baby and I work is because I let him be a man and he lets me be a woman.
- Bitch, I'ma call bell hooks on you.
- Call her.
Look, hey, but, Molly, you know what your problem is?
No, but I know you're gonna tell me.
Please enlighten me.
You always try to control shit, and men don't like that.
- You don't like that.
- They don't like it.
- He doesn't like that.
- I actually think it's kind of sexy.
Ooh, ooh.
Coat hanger.
Seriously, where are your friends?
Nah, see, I don't think they're your type.
- They're all LA dudes.
- I'll make that work.
- You went to college out here?
- Nah, I didn't go to college.
That's what's up.
- That's what's up.
- Oh!
- Cool.
- That's... that's cool!
- Hey, you know, good for you, man.
- That's cool.
You know, college isn't for everybody.
Yeah, no, I don't feel like I missed out on anything.
- Just a degree.
- Except for all the grateful women apparently waiting to suck my dick.
- I would be, I would be.
- Nasty.
But, like, back to your friends, okay?
- Kelli.
- Like, what are some of their phone numbers?
- Like, off the top of your head?
- Mm, mm-mm.
Yeah, and I'm sorry about my friends.
They were a little crazy today.
- Nah, you still...
You can fit right in.
- Did I?
You were actually very comfortable in that room.
Is that a compliment or...?
It was fun.
- I had a great time with you.
- I did, too.
But please keep all of your friends away from Kelli.
- She's crazy.
- Nah, she was funny.
- And she kind of had a good point.
- About what?
That maybe sometimes guys aren't straightforward enough.
Oh.
I like straightforward.
I like you.
I like you, too.
It's too hot up in here, and I'm not trying to sweat out my hair.
We should've gone to the movies.
Ew, don't touch me.
Honestly, Robertson is right here.
We can still make it to the Museum of Tolerance.
I hope there's a ton of trash.
If not, I brought extra.
Why do we have to clean?
Really?
It's annoying.
Excuse me, can I have your attention, please?
Thank you.
Okay, you guys, I know it's hot, all right?
And we're stuck in traffic and it's feeling like we're all gonna die on this bus, but I need you to remember that we are not home right now.
Okay?
We are in mixed company.
And a positive attitude, huh, can go a long way in making a truly worthwhile experience worth the wait.
Thank you.
Beach better have my money!
- Dayniece, that's a strike.
- Beach, don't kill my vibe!
What's my favorite word?
Beach!
Okay.
They loved you, but they decided to go another way.
What?
How did I not get it?
What am I doing wrong, Elise?
- I killed that interview.
- Nothing.
It's just tough out there right now, but we'll keep trying.
Next.
Go ahead.
Next.
Hey, Tasha.
Look at you, coming up in here looking like Obama.
I had a job interview.
Oh, okay, I see you.
Then let me go ahead and cash your last unemployment check.
Nah.
I didn't get the job.
Oh.
Well, then they stupid.
Okay?
You got a lot going for you.
Don't know about all that.
I do.
You a good black man.
You went to college.
I see you still got some savings.
- Yeah, but...
- Eh, but what?
You out there trying to work and make something of yourself, right?
- Yeah.
- With no kids?
Pfft.
Better keep your head up.
- You right.
- I know.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Whoo!
- Hey, let me play with the beach ball!
- Whoo!
Why don't more of them swim?
Slavery.
Oh, my God.
How can we be out?
Because you only brought one bottle of sunscreen.
I didn't think they'd even need any.
Hey, did you need this?
- Yes!
- Yeah, I brought extra.
You look a little burned.
In your face.
Oh, no!
Do I?
Oh, my God.
You are so burned.
I am so white.
Just spray me.
_
Oh, what?
Ben, you ain't never lie!
But, for real, I was shadowing Merrill and Johnson on the Chen case, and I had to send myself to HR because Johnson is fine!
Ooh-wee!
- Hey, Rasheeda.
Hi.
- Hi!
- Can you come in here for a second?
- Ooh, girl, of course.
- Boy, you better not eat my soup.
- Okay.
Hey!
You know, I just wanted to check in to see how you were acclimating.
Oh, girl, I'm good.
Thanks!
Good 'cause, you know, I just wanna make sure that no one gets the wrong impression of you.
Um, why would they?
Mark said I was doing great.
Yeah, and you are.
I just... you know, sometimes you can be a little...
Girl, you know how these white people are.
If you wanna be successful here, you gotta know when to switch it up a little bit.
Hmm.
- I appreciate your feedback.
- Good.
But I didn't switch it up in my interview with the senior partners and I didn't switch it up when I was named editor of the law review, so I don't think I need to switch it up now.
But thank you so much.
Okay, good.
'Cause I'm just trying to help.
Okay.
Today was awesome.
Great job, Issa.
Thank you.
And I'm really sorry about the emails before.
I...
I take full responsibility.
- I shouldn't have let that happen.
- Hey, I appreciate it.
Actually, I'd really love to make it up to you.
Can I take you to drinks or something?
- Um...
- This was such a good idea.
The kids loved it.
They always trying to doubt us.
Beach, you ain't my friend just 'cause you brown.
Oh, shit went well, so now you wanna be down?
I overheard your ass on the bus trying to clown.
Get the fuck outta here or bow the fuck down.
Hey, could you hold this real quick, please?
- Yeah.
Oh.
- Thank you.
Hey, you know what?
We should do drinks.
That sounds great.
Great, great!
Thanks.
Kids, make sure you use the bathroom before you get on the bus, okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you, Miss Issa.
Oh, Dante!
Thank you!
Go on.
Boy.
You crazy.
Guess who got into The League.
Wait, didn't you say you were done with those dating apps?
No, no, I said I was done with shitty-ass dating apps.
Plus I've been waiting, like, three months to get approved for this.
Now I can finally date dudes on my level, girl.
- And they fine as fuck.
- But I thought you were feeling Jared.
I am!
But, girl, these League niggas have been vetted.
And Jared didn't even go to college.
Yeah, but you weren't even tripping about that before.
You act like these niggas are gonna disappear.
They will!
Ugh.
Look, I just wanna see what else is out there.
Damn, Issa, why can't you just support me?
You right, you right.
You can do no wrong.
No, I'm actually right.
Not like with you and Lawrence when you're wrong, but I say that you're right, so...
Well, okay, bitch.
Have fun, then.
Bye!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't know you were cooking.
I brought food home.
Yeah, uh, you said there was no food, so I made dinner.
- It's lamb.
- Oh.
Okay, I'll just put this over here.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Uh-uh, bitch!
You ain't about to get my man, bitch!
I set the table.
Thought we could talk.
Can it wait?
I had a long day and I just wanna binge watch "Conjugal Visits."
Yeah, I just...
I cleaned over there, so...
- Issa!
- What are you yelling for?
Can you pay attention?
You didn't even ask about my shit.
You're not in this alone.
I'm fucking trying.
Put it against the wall right there.
Are you working?
Because there's literally nothing on the computer except...
My lunch break isn't eight fucking hours!
- I got it.
I'm sorry.
- No, you gotta dab it.
It doesn't matter.
It's just another stain.
No, I'm sorry for everything.
I... it's on me, too.
Hey, look.
I know I haven't been my best self lately.
All right?
In my career or with you.
Got a job.
That's great!
One of your interviews came through?
No.
It's Best Buy.
It's just a regular sales job.
I just...
I needed to handle my shit, all right?
For me and for us.
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?
I... it's just temporary, you know?
I'll keep interviewing, but... for now.
I'm proud of you.
I'm in this.
Are you?
I'm in this.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was just thinking about you.
Wanna get something to eat?
Look, Jared, I gotta be honest with you.
I'm just not looking for a relationship right now.
Really?
'Cause that is not the vibe I've been getting.
Yeah, I'm kind of bad at vibes.
Okay, so... so what have we been doing, then?
We've been hanging out as friends.
Friend?
You wanna be friends now?
I do, yes.
But, like, real friends.
So, we cool?
Yeah.
Yeah, we cool.
Good!
Great!
God, I'm so glad.
All right, well, I'll give you a call soon, then.
- All right.
- All right, bye.
- Michael.
Hi.
- Hey.
- You look great.
- You do, too.
Very nice.
All right.
Oh, my God.
- Right here?
- You got it.
Almost there.
All right, right here.
Yeah?
See?
Come on.
Can't believe we're getting rid of this thing.
- You think somebody will take it?
- I don't know.
Do people really just take couches off the...?
Hey, yo!
What y'all motherfuckers doing with that "bouch"?
- Where is he gonna put this?
- Oh, my God.
Issa.
Where have you been, huh?
- Oh, I...
I...
- Are you not coming home?
I just wanna up the quality of dudes that I meet.
There's this one app called The League.
It's for elite dating.
I've been on, like, a waiting list.
My idea is to expose them to the arts...
- Which arts?
- Like...
Wouldn't they rather go to an African American museum?
Oh, my God, what about hip-hop Shakespeare?
What if we just took these kids to the beach to start?
Make it a...
- beach cleanup.
- Beach cleanup. [music playing]

♪ You say, "Replay, run it"... ♪
- Oh, I was gonna read.
- Oh.
Uh, sorry.
I mean, I...
I could just go in the living room.
No, no, it's cool.
I could...
I could just, um... sleep with the light on.
Uh, I can just go to bed, too.
I'm good.
Ooh!
Sorry.
Your hands are cold.
Oh, my bad.
Probably all the snow cones I made.
Snow cones?
What?
No, I was...
I was just making a joke, or thought I was.
Oh. [chuckles]
Good night.

♪ Can't believe I wrote another song about you... ♪
Look, I've heard everything you said and I'm trying.
I really want this to work.
It's just... it's really frustrating because I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
You've only been job hunting for two weeks.
I know, but I thought the last interview went well.
I mean, the VP went to Georgetown, too.
They had a ton of questions.
Mostly about the gaps in your resume.
They are tough to explain.
Look, I just need to get back on my feet, okay?
I can't keep living off unemployment.
Well, if you're pressed for income, you might need to take a step back.
- How far back?
- Something entry-level.
Or maybe hourly like tech support.
No!
Elise, why would I do that?
I'm still getting interviews.
You are.
I'm just saying it could take a while.
It's fine.
No, if it's the perfect job...
I can wait.
I keep telling Ashley we have a kid on the way.
- It's not the time to add a deck.
- Oh, come on.
You just got that big-white-guy bonus.
- Hey, how'd you find out about those?
- [chuckles]
Molly:
Oh, look, we got a new black law intern.
- Aw.
- Okay, now.
I don't see color.
I just see someone who's gonna fetch me coffee.
Hey, I'll catch up with you in just a bit.
- Okay, see you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi!
I'm Molly, one of the third-year associates.
Oh, look at you!
I like seeing us in high places, girl.
Oh, well, thank you so much.
But listen, I know everything is super new right now, so if you ever need anything, I can help.
Oh, thanks...
Molly.
- Yeah.
- I appreciate it.
- And...?
- Rasheeda.
But you can call me Dada, girl.
Okay.
Da... okay.
You know what, let me check on the head count and I will get back to you with a number.
