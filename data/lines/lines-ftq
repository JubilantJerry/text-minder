- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm.
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s...
Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda...
Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
Oh, Zack.
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon...
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... is so important... at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular.
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
Ohh.
Mmm.
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know...
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
Ahh!
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I...
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
What's the worse thing that could happen?
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
Burl.
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't...
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare."
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with...
- Um...
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom.
You here to gloat?
No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
I guess this isn't shocking to you.
I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
Ohh.
I cannot tell a lie in church.
Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
A lot!
There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
Really?
Twice.
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid...
Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you...
Oval office?
I know.
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
Isn't it?
Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
Do you steal, Antoninus?
No, master.
Do you lie?
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
I've watched it 200 times.
You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look.
Mm.
- "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
- "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."
- and therefore...
- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.
- "of morals."
- "My taste includes..."
- My taste includes...
"both snails..."
both snails and oysters.
"and..."
"oysters."
I... am...
Spartacus.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds.
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and...
they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred."
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
Oh.
Sorry.
I...
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh.
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.
Hey, get me a real waitress!
Sir, please sit.
You're a danger to yourself and those around you.
Get me another pitcher, hot stuff.
Twin peaks is giving us attitude.
- Is she?
- Yeah.
Ohh!
Her name is Sapphire, and what she'll give you is your check.
Good night.
You ain't gettin' no tip.
Oh, honey, your butt headed out the door is gratuity enough.
Sorry, Amanda.
Hey, Ripp.
I didn't see you come in.
Way to take him down, Amanda.
Well, every now and then you gotta bust some balls.
Oh, God.
Pastor Tudor.
I couldn't agree more.
Matthew 21:12... uh, Jesus threw out thieves and robbers.
Sometimes you gotta cleanse the temple.
I'm a little thrown.
I've never seen you undressed.
Well, he wanted to do a little research for his sermon, so I'm treating him to dinner.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, gotta see a man about a horse.
Well, you know where it is.
No, I mean I gotta talk to Bubba Richardson about buying his horse.
Sermon research?
Here?
About what?
Uh, communication in relationships.
Seems like a lot of married men.
Married guys love coming here, and it ain't for the food.
Well, it's all about sex.
Um, can I get you another beer?
Uh, appetizer?
I'm finding people have a hard time talking about sex.
Don't you?
No, not at all.
Would you like to talk about something else?
That would be divine.
I've been watching you, ever since you moved to town.
You've got such grace under pressure.
You're good with difficult people.
The way you handled those drunks tonight... that... that was just perfect.
Look, I'm sure you get a lot of propositions here, but I'll bet you've never gotten one like this.
And then he offered me a job... church secretary.
I start tomorrow.
Church secretary is the worst job in the world.
How can that be?
All I do is answer the phone and deal with the church stuff and help pastor Tudor, who I like.
Yeah, but you work nights.
Now you'll be working days.
Yeah.
When am I gonna get to see you?
I'll squeeze you in.
All right.
I... are you sure you're ready for this?
I think so.
Maybe we should talk.
Pastor Tudor was saying that communication about sex is key.
Mm.
Hey, hey, hey!
I've been noticing how dark it is down here in the guesthouse, and I've been meaning to bring this lamp, so you could have more light for reading and...
Well-lit activities.
Sis, got company.
I know that, silly.
My security cameras don't miss a thing.
Gotta watch out for unwelcome intruders.
Barn door's open.
Okay.
- To be continued.
- Ohh.
- Carlene.
- Mm.
- As always.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, was I...
Did y'all...
What qualifies you to carry our child?
Oh, well, I'm a triathlete.
I'm vegan.
I've only eaten organic for the last 11 years, and I just love the idea of helping an infertile couple find joy.
- Oh, we are not infertile.
- No.
I am just not in a position to give up alcohol, sushi, or grabbing stimulus dollars for nine months.
You gotta be on your toes for that one.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Emma, you took a year off between hockaday and S.M.U.
- Mm.
- Could you tell us why?
Oh, that was just for the election.
I campaigned for Obama.
We'll be in touch.
Bye-bye now.
Well...
That's it.
The last of our a-list applicants.
We have to widen our search, baby.
We might have to go outside Texas.
No.
We agreed we would not lower our standards.
Maybe there just isn't anyone good enough to carry our baby.
Hey.
Hey.
That is not my girl.
Now we'll find somebody.
Don't you give up hope.
Can I warm up your coffee?
Nah.
How about I top off your tater tots?
No, I'm trying to cut back, maintain control.
Did you know that Blake only eats egg whites ever?
Oh, poor Cricket.
All those yolks gone to waste.
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, can you give me a little bit of that brown, crunchy sugar?
Zack Peacham, you notice my jeans right now!
Hey.
They don't even look like pajama bottoms.
They even got a zipper and everything.
I haven't been able to fit into these bad girls for five years, and I owe it all to the holy word.
Is that fish?
Mm-hmm.
Lemon-grilled, just like Jesus served at Galilee.
At 8:00 in the morning?
Well, it's the only breakfast food that's mentioned in the scriptures.
When I was volunteering for pastor Tudor,
I came across this book, "Foods of the Bible."
The holy land was filled with high fiber and low carb, but you have to be careful of new testament entrees.
They break a lot of bread.
For lunch, I'm doing ground lamb, which my research shows was served at the wedding of King David.
What'd they eat for dessert?
Nothing good, so what I've done is,
I've put a sweet Bible verse in each basket.
Genesis 9:3...
"every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you."
And then each basket is inspired by the one built by Jochebed to float baby Moses down the Nile.
Sharon, you might just be on to something.
I don't recall any fat people in the Bible.
I know, right?
Accountants.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Gotta go.
Basically, you just keep my schedule, oversee booking the church facilities for events, and here's the real, uh, challenge of a church secretary...
I must always be accessible to my congregation, but I also have to have time for pastoral concerns...
- uh, to write sermons.
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta have the wisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.
It can get kinda tricky.
Hey, I worked Boobylicious after the Texas-O.U. game.
Nothing scares me.
I served 18 months in Iraq.
Some of ladies around here do.
Oh.
Amanda, Amanda, Amanda.
Oh.
I just keep walking in on you in the most unnatural situations.
Amanda's the newest addition to my staff.
She's working for you?
You're paying Amanda to do what you got from me for free?
It's the way of the world, darlin'.
Way of the world.
What can we do for you, ladies?
- We?
- Mm-hmm.
John...
Sharon, Cricket, and I have just returned from the Women of the Church Outreach Committee meeting, and we are bursting with ideas we're dying to share with you.
Blake and I would like to establish a scholarship for young, unwed mothers.
We already have an aid program for unwed mothers.
But our program would be for unwed mothers who aren't pregnant yet.
They need to be from the best families with a minimum score of 2,300 on their S.A.T.s.
Gettin' pregnant would be part of the program.
That makes no sense, Cricket.
It makes sense to Blake and me, and we're writing the check.
Oh, and, John...
Do you remember my "condos for Christian living,"
which I was forced to relocate?
Well, uncle Burl has just returned from unincorporated Juarez with some very exciting news...
I'm dying to share with you.
Carlene...
You know how many laws you'd be breaking selling apartments only to christians?
Not in Mexico.
Stay in your lane, sweetie.
I've lost weight.
Can you tell?
Okay, ladies.
The pastor needs to work on his sermon now.
Ladies!
I have a topic.
In fact, it was kinda inspired by a conversation I had with Amanda.
Me?
I see.
I'm sure she's a bottomless pit...
Of inspiration.
But I doubt she's ever gone down a whole dress size 'cause of the Bible.
- Let's go.
- Ladies, give a call, and we'll get a time on the books.
- Uh...
- Uh...
- I have never...
- It's time to go.
Uh...
God be with you, ladies!
Whew.
GCB 1x07
- Sex is Divine Original air date April 8, 2012
So, kids, that's what it means when we say it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Now off you go to Sunday school.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.
So it's just us grown-ups now, right?
'Cause this message is adults-only.
People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"
I'll tell you.
Sex is divine.
Inspired by Amanda.
Surprise, surprise.
Sex is a gift from God.
He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
But look around at the world today.
Are we making the best use of God's gift?
I wonder.
I want to try an experiment for all you committed couples out there.
I'm talkin' married or otherwise entwined.
Now everyone here is an adult, so you can determine if this exercise is for you.
Here's my assignment.
From today till next Sunday,
I'm challenging you all to have sex with your partner once a day, every single day.
Touch each other.
Look into each other's eyes and souls.
Truly share one another, and let's see what happens.
So I was thinkin', for our next date, maybe we don't go to my sister's house.
And we don't go to my house.
Way too much Gigi.
And there's my kids.
I mean, they've never even seen me with another man.
I don't even know how they feel about it.
Will they think that I'm bringing home a new stepdad,
- or will they think that I'm just...
- O... okay.
Slow down.
Slow down there, light speed.
We're just talkin' a date.
That's it.
I know.
I know.
Sorry.
I obviously bring a lot of baggage, and sometimes it just rolls away from me.
Listen, I'll tell you what.
I'm heading back to Austin for a few days.
When I get back,
I'm gettin' us a suite at The Ritz... room service, "do not disturb" on the door.
We can check in under a fictitious name that Carlene can't figure out.
Ohh.
Mwah.
Tudor's sermon got me thinking about
- our little surrogate issue.
- Shh.
And I realized there's only one womb that's good enough to carry our progeny.
Taylor Swift is not from Texas.
I'm talkin' about you.
Why outsource when we can go in-house?
We did it the old-fashioned way once.
This dream team can repeat.
Are you talking about... you and me... doing what comes naturally?
Why not?
We're fabulous.
I think you understand better than anyone just how complicated that proposition is.
Last time, it was the '90s.
We were young and drunk.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Things have changed.
Not everything's changed.
I still love you, Crick.
We can do this.
I'm in if you are.
Then let's kick this pig.
Hey, did you hear about the sermon?
I don't know why everybody's weirding out.
Who cares how many times married people do it?
Wait.
Is it just old people?
I'm not sure about the details...
But pastor Tudor knows what's up.
Totally.
He's pretty awesome.
Churro?
When I saw this property, Burl,
I thought of you.
Now you know that I would never pressure you, but full disclosure...
I just booked another showing for this evening, so if you love it, you better jump on it.
It's gonna go fast.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Heather Cruz.
Talk to me.
You like it?
Good bones, nice land, great party flow.
You don't think the leather floors are too much?
For a man with stingray hide on the walls of his yacht?
No, Burl.
It's your style all the way.
Can you see yourself here?
I'm imagining some very neighborly visits...
Sleepovers, even...
A medicine cabinet filled with a standing supply of very expensive eye cream, which you shall never see me apply.
But do you love it?
Could you be happy here?
It's your house, Burl.
You're the one who has to be happy here.
Yeah, but I wouldn't be without you.
What are we talking about here?
Are you asking me to move in?
Lord, no.
No, I-I would never.
I...
I would never ask you to spend the night unless...
I was gonna wait for the right time, the perfect time, but Heather's right.
When you find what you want, you have got to jump.
Jumping's the other way.
You've dropped down.
Marry me, Gigi.
That pastor Tudor is one smart man.
Yeah, sex is so damn divine.
- It's amazing.
- Whew.
Where did you learn to do that thing that you just did?
Well, uh... sometimes when... when things are slow at work,
I watch movies that are... kinda adult.
And things have been really slow lately.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I shouldn't have said that.
I...
I'm sorry.
I...
I f...
I'm kinda embarrassed now.
Oh, it's okay.
If they... teach you to do... that,
I'm not opposed to educational films.
What else have you learned?
Well... there was this one move that this lady archaeologist did in "Romancing The Bone"...
- Mmm!
- Mmm.
All right.
It's showtime.
That's good.
So... where do we start?
- You don't know Tae Kwon Do?
- Mnh-mnh.
Let's try massage.
No eye contact.
- Ooh, I like rules.
- Mm.
- All right, that good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
That all right?
- Mm-hmm.
No giggling'.
Giggling is not hot.
Well, I am ticklish there, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I'm sorry, honey.
Um, you know, you wanna try lying down?
On my front or back?
Well, w... uh...
I guess, for you, on your back.
That'd... okay.
Giggling.
Sorry.
Keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, come on now.
Cricket, I am trying to get in the mood.
I just can't stop wondering, what are you into?
What you wanna know?
Okay.
All right.
Let's say sex was a... was a football game.
Where are you during the snap?
Do you play offense or defense?
Depends on the game.
Fascinating.
You know, this sports metaphor's kind of doing it for me.
That right?
You wanna kickoff or should I?
I will flip you for it.
Oh, Crick.
This is harder than I thought.
Yeah, or not.
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
There ain't gonna be any dancing in the end zone tonight.
Nope.
Burl proposed?
What did you say?
I said, "get up off your knee before you hurt yourself."
Then I said I'd have to think about it.
Oh, mama.
Uh...
Burl is crazy about you, and you are crazy about him.
Why didn't you just say yes?
I have been "not married" as long as I was married.
I like "not married" just fine.
I'm not gonna rush into anything again just because some man hands me something sparkly.
Okay.
Well, maybe it is a little fast, but you two both love each other.
Why you have to beat around the bush?
I just don't like feeling pressured to make big decisions.
I don't even buy a car without a test-drive... especially a stick shift.
Mother.
What?
It's an important part of any relationship.
I'm just taking my cues from the pastor.
You can thank him tomorrow for inspiring me.
Ohh!
- Ooh!
- Look at us.
Oh!
- You play some Ace of Base on the radio...
- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm.
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s...
Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda...
Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
Oh, Zack.
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon...
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... is so important... at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular.
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
Ohh.
Mmm.
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know...
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
Ahh!
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I...
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
What's the worse thing that could happen?
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
Burl.
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't...
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare."
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with...
- Um...
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom.
You here to gloat?
No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
I guess this isn't shocking to you.
I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
Ohh.
I cannot tell a lie in church.
Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
A lot!
There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
Really?
Twice.
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid...
Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you...
Oval office?
I know.
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
Isn't it?
Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
Do you steal, Antoninus?
No, master.
Do you lie?
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
I've watched it 200 times.
You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look.
Mm.
- "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
- "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."
- and therefore...
- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.
- "of morals."
- "My taste includes..."
- My taste includes...
"both snails..."
both snails and oysters.
"and..."
"oysters."
I... am...
Spartacus.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds.
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and...
they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred."
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
Oh.
Sorry.
I...
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh.
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.

Hey, get me a real waitress!
Sir, please sit. (Chuckles)
You're a danger to yourself and those around you.
Get me another pitcher, hot stuff.
Twin peaks is giving us attitude.
- Is she?
- Yeah.
(Laughs)
(Grunts) Ohh!
(Groans, panting) Her name is Sapphire, and what she'll give you is your check.
Good night.
(Strained voice) You ain't gettin' no tip.
Oh, honey, your butt headed out the door is gratuity enough.
(Man) Sorry, Amanda.
Hey, Ripp.
I didn't see you come in.
Way to take him down, Amanda.
Well, every now and then you gotta bust some balls.
(Chuckles) Oh, God.
Pastor Tudor.
I couldn't agree more.
Matthew 21:12... uh, Jesus threw out thieves and robbers.
Sometimes you gotta cleanse the temple.
I'm a little thrown.
I've never seen you undressed.
Well, he wanted to do a little research for his sermon, so I'm treating him to dinner.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, gotta see a man about a horse.
Well, you know where it is. (Chuckles)
No, I mean I gotta talk to Bubba Richardson about buying his horse.
Sermon research?
Here?
About what?
Uh, communication in relationships.
Seems like a lot of married men. (Chuckles)
Married guys love coming here, and it ain't for the food.
Well, it's all about sex.
Um, can I get you another beer?
Uh, appetizer?
I'm finding people have a hard time talking about sex.
Don't you?
No, not at all.
Would you like to talk about something else?
That would be divine. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles) I've been watching you, ever since you moved to town.
You've got such grace under pressure.
You're good with difficult people.
The way you handled those drunks tonight... that... that was just perfect.
Look, I'm sure you get a lot of propositions here, but I'll bet you've never gotten one like this.
And then he offered me a job... church secretary.
I start tomorrow.
Church secretary is the worst job in the world.
How can that be?
(Chuckles)
All I do is answer the phone and deal with the church stuff and help pastor Tudor, who I like.
Yeah, but you work nights.
Now you'll be working days.
Yeah.
When am I gonna get to see you?
(Whispers) I'll squeeze you in.
(Sighs)
All right.
I... are you sure you're ready for this?
(Whispers) I think so.
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
Maybe we should talk.
Pastor Tudor was saying that communication about sex is key. (Sighs)
(Both panting)
Mm.
(Both chuckle)
(Door closes)
Hey, hey, hey!
I've been noticing how dark it is down here in the guesthouse, and I've been meaning to bring this lamp, so you could have more light for reading and... (Click) Well-lit activities.
Sis, got company.
I know that, silly.
My security cameras don't miss a thing.
(Chuckles) Gotta watch out for unwelcome intruders.
Barn door's open.
(Laughs) Okay.
- To be continued.
- Ohh.
- Carlene.
- Mm.
- As always.
- Mm-hmm.
(Gasps) Oh, was I...
Did y'all...
What qualifies you to carry our child?
Oh, well, I'm a triathlete.
I'm vegan.
I've only eaten organic for the last 11 years, and I just love the idea of helping an infertile couple find joy.
- Oh, we are not infertile.
(Chuckles)
- No.
I am just not in a position to give up alcohol, sushi, or grabbing stimulus dollars for nine months.
You gotta be on your toes for that one.
Mm-hmm. (Chuckles)
Uh, Emma, you took a year off between hockaday and S.M.U.
- Mm.
- Could you tell us why?
Oh, that was just for the election.
(Chuckles)
I campaigned for Obama.
We'll be in touch.
Bye-bye now.
(Mouths word)
Well... (Sighs) That's it.
The last of our a-list applicants.
We have to widen our search, baby.
(File clatters)
We might have to go outside Texas.
No.
We agreed we would not lower our standards.
Maybe there just isn't anyone good enough to carry our baby.
Hey.
Hey.
That is not my girl.
Now we'll find somebody.
Don't you give up hope.
Can I warm up your coffee?
Nah.
How about I top off your tater tots?
(Clangs)
No, I'm trying to cut back, maintain control.
Did you know that Blake only eats egg whites ever?
Oh, poor Cricket.
All those yolks gone to waste.
(Clears throat)
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, can you give me a little bit of that brown, crunchy sugar?
Zack Peacham, you notice my jeans right now!
Hey.
They don't even look like pajama bottoms.
They even got a zipper and everything.
I haven't been able to fit into these bad girls for five years, and I owe it all to the holy word.
Is that fish?
Mm-hmm.
Lemon-grilled, just like Jesus served at Galilee.
At 8:00 in the morning?
Well, it's the only breakfast food that's mentioned in the scriptures.
When I was volunteering for pastor Tudor,
I came across this book, "Foods of the Bible."
The holy land was filled with high fiber and low carb, but you have to be careful of new testament entrees.
They break a lot of bread.
For lunch, I'm doing ground lamb, which my research shows was served at the wedding of King David.
What'd they eat for dessert?
Nothing good, so what I've done is,
I've put a sweet Bible verse in each basket.
Genesis 9:3...
"every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you."
And then each basket is inspired by the one built by Jochebed to float baby Moses down the Nile.
Sharon, you might just be on to something.
I don't recall any fat people in the Bible.
I know, right?
(Rings)
(Clears throat) Accountants.
(Sighs)
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Gotta go.
Basically, you just keep my schedule, oversee booking the church facilities for events, and here's the real, uh, challenge of a church secretary...
I must always be accessible to my congregation, but I also have to have time for pastoral concerns...
- uh, to write sermons.
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta have the wisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.
(Chuckles) It can get kinda tricky.
Hey, I worked Boobylicious after the Texas-O.U. game.
Nothing scares me.
I served 18 months in Iraq.
Some of ladies around here do.
(Carlene, Cricket, and Sharon speak indistinctly)
Oh.
Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. (Chuckles) Oh.
I just keep walking in on you in the most unnatural situations.
(Amanda chuckles)
Amanda's the newest addition to my staff.
She's working for you?
You're paying Amanda to do what you got from me for free?
It's the way of the world, darlin'.
Way of the world.
(Sighs) What can we do for you, ladies?
- We?
(Chuckles)
- Mm-hmm.
John...
Sharon, Cricket, and I have just returned from the Women of the Church Outreach Committee meeting, and we are bursting with ideas we're dying to share with you. (Sighs)
Blake and I would like to establish a scholarship for young, unwed mothers.
We already have an aid program for unwed mothers.
But our program would be for unwed mothers who aren't pregnant yet.
They need to be from the best families with a minimum score of 2,300 on their S.A.T.s.
Gettin' pregnant would be part of the program.
That makes no sense, Cricket.
It makes sense to Blake and me, and we're writing the check.
Oh, and, John... (Grunts) Do you remember my "condos for Christian living,"
which I was forced to relocate?
Well, uncle Burl has just returned from unincorporated Juarez with some very exciting news... (Whispers) I'm dying to share with you.
Carlene... (Sighs)
You know how many laws you'd be breaking selling apartments only to christians?
Not in Mexico.
Stay in your lane, sweetie.
I've lost weight.
Can you tell?
Okay, ladies.
The pastor needs to work on his sermon now.
(Carlene, Cricket, and Sharon speaking indistinctly)
Ladies!
I have a topic.
In fact, it was kinda inspired by a conversation I had with Amanda.
Me?
I see.
I'm sure she's a bottomless pit...
Of inspiration.
But I doubt she's ever gone down a whole dress size 'cause of the Bible.
- Let's go.
- Ladies, give a call, and we'll get a time on the books.
- Uh...
(Scoffs)
- Uh...
- I have never...
- It's time to go.
(Women speaking indistinctly)
Uh...
God be with you, ladies!

Whew.

GCB 1x07
- Sex is Divine Original air date April 8, 2012
So, kids, that's what it means when we say it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
(Cricket and Carlene mouth words)
Now off you go to Sunday school.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.
(Indistinct conversations)
So it's just us grown-ups now, right?
(Door closes)
'Cause this message is adults-only.
People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"
I'll tell you.
Sex is divine.
(Congregation murmuring)
(Lowered voice) Inspired by Amanda.
(Lowered voice) Surprise, surprise.
Sex is a gift from God.
He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
But look around at the world today.
Are we making the best use of God's gift?
I wonder.
I want to try an experiment for all you committed couples out there.
I'm talkin' married or otherwise entwined.
Now everyone here is an adult, so you can determine if this exercise is for you.
Here's my assignment.
From today till next Sunday,
I'm challenging you all to have sex with your partner once a day, every single day.
Touch each other.
Look into each other's eyes and souls.
Truly share one another, and let's see what happens.
(Bells tolling)
So I was thinkin', for our next date, maybe we don't go to my sister's house.
And we don't go to my house. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles) Way too much Gigi.
And there's my kids.
I mean, they've never even seen me with another man.
I don't even know how they feel about it.
Will they think that I'm bringing home a new stepdad,
- or will they think that I'm just...
- O... okay.
Slow down.
Slow down there, light speed.
We're just talkin' a date.
That's it.
I know.
I know.
Sorry. (Chuckles)
I obviously bring a lot of baggage, and sometimes it just rolls away from me.
Listen, I'll tell you what. (Sighs)
I'm heading back to Austin for a few days.
When I get back,
I'm gettin' us a suite at The Ritz... room service, "do not disturb" on the door.
We can check in under a fictitious name that Carlene can't figure out.
Ohh.
(Chuckles) Mwah.
(Inhales and exhales deeply)
Tudor's sermon got me thinking about
- our little surrogate issue.
(Lowered voice)
- Shh.
(Lowered voice) And I realized there's only one womb that's good enough to carry our progeny.
Taylor Swift is not from Texas.
I'm talkin' about you.
Why outsource when we can go in-house?
We did it the old-fashioned way once.
This dream team can repeat.
Are you talking about... you and me... doing what comes naturally?
Why not?
We're fabulous.
I think you understand better than anyone just how complicated that proposition is.
Last time, it was the '90s.
We were young and drunk.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Things have changed.
Not everything's changed.
I still love you, Crick.
We can do this.
I'm in if you are.
Then let's kick this pig.
(Both chuckle)
Hey, did you hear about the sermon?
I don't know why everybody's weirding out. (Chuckles)
Who cares how many times married people do it?
Wait.
Is it just old people?
I'm not sure about the details... (Chuckles)
But pastor Tudor knows what's up.
Totally.
He's pretty awesome.
Churro?
(Chuckles and crunches)
(Indistinct conversations)
(Heather) When I saw this property, Burl,
I thought of you.
Now you know that I would never pressure you, but full disclosure...
I just booked another showing for this evening, so if you love it, you better jump on it.
It's gonna go fast.
(Rings)
Oh.
Excuse me. (Beep)
Heather Cruz.
Talk to me.
(Lowered voice) You like it?
(Sighs)
Good bones, nice land, great party flow.
You don't think the leather floors are too much?
(Chuckles) For a man with stingray hide on the walls of his yacht?
No, Burl.
It's your style all the way.
(Laughs)
Can you see yourself here?
I'm imagining some very neighborly visits...
Sleepovers, even...
A medicine cabinet filled with a standing supply of very expensive eye cream, which you shall never see me apply.
But do you love it?
Could you be happy here?
(Chuckles) It's your house, Burl.
You're the one who has to be happy here.
Yeah, but I wouldn't be without you.
What are we talking about here?
Are you asking me to move in?
Lord, no.
No, I-I would never.
I... (Chuckles) I would never ask you to spend the night unless... (Inhales deeply)
I was gonna wait for the right time, the perfect time, but Heather's right.
When you find what you want, you have got to jump.
Jumping's the other way.
You've dropped down.
Marry me, Gigi.
(Both panting)
That pastor Tudor is one smart man.
Yeah, sex is so damn divine.
- It's amazing.
- Whew.
Where did you learn to do that thing that you just did?
Well, uh... sometimes when... when things are slow at work,
I watch movies that are... kinda adult.
And things have been really slow lately.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I shouldn't have said that.
I...
I'm sorry.
I...
I f...
I'm kinda embarrassed now. (Chuckles)
Oh, it's okay.
If they... teach you to do... that,
I'm not opposed to educational films.
What else have you learned?
Well... (Clears throat) there was this one move that this lady archaeologist did in "Romancing The Bone"...
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

Let's try massage.
No eye contact.
- Ooh, I like rules.
- Mm.
- All right, that good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
That all right?
- Mm-hmm.
(Giggles)
No giggling'.
Giggling is not hot.
Well, I am ticklish there, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I'm sorry, honey.
Um, you know, you wanna try lying down?
On my front or back?
Well, w... uh...
I guess, for you, on your back.
That'd... okay.
(Giggles)
Giggling.
Sorry.
Keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, come on now.
Cricket, I am trying to get in the mood.
I just can't stop wondering, what are you into?
(Sighs) What you wanna know?
Okay.
All right.
Let's say sex was a... was a football game.
Where are you during the snap?
Do you play offense or defense?
Depends on the game.
Fascinating.
You know, this sports metaphor's kind of doing it for me.
That right?
You wanna kickoff or should I?
I will flip you for it.
(Laughs) Oh, Crick.
This is harder than I thought.
Yeah, or not.
(Both laugh)
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
There ain't gonna be any dancing in the end zone tonight.
Nope.
Burl proposed?
(Gasps) What did you say?
I said, "get up off your knee before you hurt yourself."
Then I said I'd have to think about it.
Oh, mama.
Uh...
Burl is crazy about you, and you are crazy about him.
Why didn't you just say yes?
I have been "not married" as long as I was married.
I like "not married" just fine.
I'm not gonna rush into anything again just because some man hands me something sparkly.
Okay.
Well, maybe it is a little fast, but you two both love each other.
Why you have to beat around the bush?
I just don't like feeling pressured to make big decisions.
I don't even buy a car without a test-drive... (Whispers) especially a stick shift.
(Click) Mother.
What?
It's an important part of any relationship.
I'm just taking my cues from the pastor.
You can thank him tomorrow for inspiring me.
(Ace of Base's "The Sign" playing)
Ohh!
(Pants)
- Ooh!
(Panting)
- Look at us.
(Sighs) Oh!
- You play some Ace of Base on the radio...
- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
(Sighs)
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm. (Moans)
(Alarm blaring) (Groans)
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
(Laughs) Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s... (Claps hands) Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda... (Whispers) Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
(Scoffs)
(Key jangle)
(Singsongy) Oh, Zack.
(Click)
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon... (Chair thuds)
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... (Briefcase thuds) is so important... (Keys clatter) at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular. (Mouths word)
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
(Blows air)
Ohh.
Mmm.
(Both moan)
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
(Exhales deeply)
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know... (Grunts)
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
(Sighs deeply) No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
(Sighs)
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
(Gasps) God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
(Plastic bottle crinkles)
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
(Panting)
Ahh!
(Gasps)
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
(Chuckles) I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I... (Chuckles)
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... (Whispers) lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
(Chuckles)
What's the worse thing that could happen?
(Chuckles)
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
(Laughs)
Burl.
(Groans)
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
(Siren wailing, police radio chatter)
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
(Scoffs) I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
(Gigi) What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
(Chuckles) You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
(Chuckles) You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
(Utensils clatter)
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
(Giggles)
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
(Chuckles) What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't... (Clicks tongue and scoffs)
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare." (Scoffs)
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
(Carlene) Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with... (curtain rings swoosh)
- Um...
(Carlene)
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom. (Chuckles)
(Amanda and Carlene gasp)
You here to gloat?
(Sighs) No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... (Whispering) those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
(Normal voice) I guess this isn't shocking to you.
(Chuckles) I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
(Whispers) Ohh.
(Mouths words and inhales deeply)
I cannot tell a lie in church.
(Lowered voice) Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
(Echoing voice) A lot!
(Gasps)
(Lowered voice) There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
(Sighs) I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
(Both laughing)
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
(Chuckles)
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does. (Chuckles)
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
(Inhales deeply) Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
(Clicks switch)
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
(Chuckles)
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
(Whispers indistinctly)
(Whispers) Really?
Twice.
(Gasps)
(Clicks)
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
(Clicks tongue)
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid... (Whispers indistinctly)
(Gasps) Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you... (Whispers indistinctly)
Oval office?
(Voice breaks) I know.
(Exhales deeply)
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
(Chuckles) Isn't it?
(Sighs) Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
(Door closes)
(Crassus) Do you steal, Antoninus?
(Antoninus) No, master.
(Water splashing)
Do you lie?
(Clatters)
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
(Chuckles) I've watched it 200 times.
(Chuckles) You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look. (Chuckles)
Mm. (Chuckles)
(British accent) - "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
(British accent) - "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
(Chuckles)
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."

- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.

Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds. (Chuckles)
(Gasps)
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
(Gasps) Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and... (sniffles) they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred." (Mouths words)
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... (Exhales deeply)
(Whispers) is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
(Whispers) I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
(Chuckles) Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
(Laughs)
(Sighs)
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
(Both chuckle)
Oh.
Sorry.
I... (Chuckles)
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
(Closes door)
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
(Sighs) Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh. (Pants)
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.

Oh, honey, your butt headed out the door is gratuity enough.
(Man) Sorry, Amanda.
Hey, Ripp.
I didn't see you come in.
Way to take him down, Amanda.
Well, every now and then you gotta bust some balls.
(Chuckles) Oh, God.
Pastor Tudor.
I couldn't agree more.
Matthew 21:12... uh, Jesus threw out thieves and robbers.
Sometimes you gotta cleanse the temple.
I'm a little thrown.
I've never seen you undressed.
Well, he wanted to do a little research for his sermon, so I'm treating him to dinner.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, gotta see a man about a horse.
Well, you know where it is. (Chuckles)
No, I mean I gotta talk to Bubba Richardson about buying his horse.
Sermon research?
Here?
About what?
Uh, communication in relationships.
Seems like a lot of married men. (Chuckles)
Married guys love coming here, and it ain't for the food.
Well, it's all about sex.
Um, can I get you another beer?
Uh, appetizer?
I'm finding people have a hard time talking about sex.
Don't you?
No, not at all.
Would you like to talk about something else?
That would be divine. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles) I've been watching you, ever since you moved to town.
You've got such grace under pressure.
You're good with difficult people.
The way you handled those drunks tonight... that... that was just perfect.
Look, I'm sure you get a lot of propositions here, but I'll bet you've never gotten one like this.
And then he offered me a job... church secretary.
I start tomorrow.
Church secretary is the worst job in the world.
How can that be?
(Chuckles)
All I do is answer the phone and deal with the church stuff and help pastor Tudor, who I like.
Yeah, but you work nights.
Now you'll be working days.
Yeah.
When am I gonna get to see you?
(Whispers) I'll squeeze you in.
(Sighs)
All right.
I... are you sure you're ready for this?
(Whispers) I think so.
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
Maybe we should talk.
Pastor Tudor was saying that communication about sex is key. (Sighs)
(Both panting)
Mm.
(Both chuckle)
(Door closes)
Hey, hey, hey!
I've been noticing how dark it is down here in the guesthouse, and I've been meaning to bring this lamp, so you could have more light for reading and... (Click) Well-lit activities.
Sis, got company.
I know that, silly.
My security cameras don't miss a thing.
(Chuckles) Gotta watch out for unwelcome intruders.
Barn door's open.
(Laughs) Okay.
- To be continued.
- Ohh.
- Carlene.
- Mm.
- As always.
- Mm-hmm.
(Gasps) Oh, was I...
Did y'all...
What qualifies you to carry our child?
Oh, well, I'm a triathlete.
I'm vegan.
I've only eaten organic for the last 11 years, and I just love the idea of helping an infertile couple find joy.
- Oh, we are not infertile.
(Chuckles)
- No.
I am just not in a position to give up alcohol, sushi, or grabbing stimulus dollars for nine months.
You gotta be on your toes for that one.
Mm-hmm. (Chuckles)
Uh, Emma, you took a year off between hockaday and S.M.U.
- Mm.
- Could you tell us why?
Oh, that was just for the election.
(Chuckles)
I campaigned for Obama.
We'll be in touch.
Bye-bye now.
(Mouths word)
Well... (Sighs) That's it.
The last of our a-list applicants.
We have to widen our search, baby.
(File clatters)
We might have to go outside Texas.
No.
We agreed we would not lower our standards.
Maybe there just isn't anyone good enough to carry our baby.
Hey.
Hey.
That is not my girl.
Now we'll find somebody.
Don't you give up hope.
Can I warm up your coffee?
Nah.
How about I top off your tater tots?
(Clangs)
No, I'm trying to cut back, maintain control.
Did you know that Blake only eats egg whites ever?
Oh, poor Cricket.
All those yolks gone to waste.
(Clears throat)
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, can you give me a little bit of that brown, crunchy sugar?
Zack Peacham, you notice my jeans right now!
Hey.
They don't even look like pajama bottoms.
They even got a zipper and everything.
I haven't been able to fit into these bad girls for five years, and I owe it all to the holy word.
Is that fish?
Mm-hmm.
Lemon-grilled, just like Jesus served at Galilee.
At 8:00 in the morning?
Well, it's the only breakfast food that's mentioned in the scriptures.
When I was volunteering for pastor Tudor,
I came across this book, "Foods of the Bible."
The holy land was filled with high fiber and low carb, but you have to be careful of new testament entrees.
They break a lot of bread.
For lunch, I'm doing ground lamb, which my research shows was served at the wedding of King David.
What'd they eat for dessert?
Nothing good, so what I've done is,
I've put a sweet Bible verse in each basket.
Genesis 9:3...
"every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you."
And then each basket is inspired by the one built by Jochebed to float baby Moses down the Nile.
Sharon, you might just be on to something.
I don't recall any fat people in the Bible.
I know, right?
(Rings)
(Clears throat) Accountants.
(Sighs)
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Gotta go.
Basically, you just keep my schedule, oversee booking the church facilities for events, and here's the real, uh, challenge of a church secretary...
I must always be accessible to my congregation, but I also have to have time for pastoral concerns...
- uh, to write sermons.
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta have the wisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.
(Chuckles) It can get kinda tricky.
Hey, I worked Boobylicious after the Texas-O.U. game.
Nothing scares me.
I served 18 months in Iraq.
Some of ladies around here do.
(Carlene, Cricket, and Sharon speak indistinctly)
Oh.
Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. (Chuckles) Oh.
I just keep walking in on you in the most unnatural situations.
(Amanda chuckles)
Amanda's the newest addition to my staff.
She's working for you?
You're paying Amanda to do what you got from me for free?
It's the way of the world, darlin'.
Way of the world.
(Sighs) What can we do for you, ladies?
- We?
(Chuckles)
- Mm-hmm.
John...
Sharon, Cricket, and I have just returned from the Women of the Church Outreach Committee meeting, and we are bursting with ideas we're dying to share with you. (Sighs)
Blake and I would like to establish a scholarship for young, unwed mothers.
We already have an aid program for unwed mothers.
But our program would be for unwed mothers who aren't pregnant yet.
They need to be from the best families with a minimum score of 2,300 on their S.A.T.s.
Gettin' pregnant would be part of the program.
That makes no sense, Cricket.
It makes sense to Blake and me, and we're writing the check.
Oh, and, John... (Grunts) Do you remember my "condos for Christian living,"
which I was forced to relocate?
Well, uncle Burl has just returned from unincorporated Juarez with some very exciting news... (Whispers) I'm dying to share with you.
Carlene... (Sighs)
You know how many laws you'd be breaking selling apartments only to christians?
Not in Mexico.
Stay in your lane, sweetie.
I've lost weight.
Can you tell?
Okay, ladies.
The pastor needs to work on his sermon now.
(Carlene, Cricket, and Sharon speaking indistinctly)
Ladies!
I have a topic.
In fact, it was kinda inspired by a conversation I had with Amanda.
Me?
I see.
I'm sure she's a bottomless pit...
Of inspiration.
But I doubt she's ever gone down a whole dress size 'cause of the Bible.
- Let's go.
- Ladies, give a call, and we'll get a time on the books.
- Uh...
(Scoffs)
- Uh...
- I have never...
- It's time to go.
(Women speaking indistinctly)
Uh...
God be with you, ladies!

GCB 1x07
- Sex is Divine Original air date April 8, 2012
So, kids, that's what it means when we say it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
(Cricket and Carlene mouth words)
Now off you go to Sunday school.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.
(Indistinct conversations)
So it's just us grown-ups now, right?
(Door closes)
'Cause this message is adults-only.
People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"
I'll tell you.
Sex is divine.
(Congregation murmuring)
(Lowered voice) Inspired by Amanda.
(Lowered voice) Surprise, surprise.
Sex is a gift from God.
He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
But look around at the world today.
Are we making the best use of God's gift?
I wonder.
I want to try an experiment for all you committed couples out there.
I'm talkin' married or otherwise entwined.
Now everyone here is an adult, so you can determine if this exercise is for you.
Here's my assignment.
From today till next Sunday,
I'm challenging you all to have sex with your partner once a day, every single day.
Touch each other.
Look into each other's eyes and souls.
Truly share one another, and let's see what happens.
(Bells tolling)
So I was thinkin', for our next date, maybe we don't go to my sister's house.
And we don't go to my house. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles) Way too much Gigi.
And there's my kids.
I mean, they've never even seen me with another man.
I don't even know how they feel about it.
Will they think that I'm bringing home a new stepdad,
- or will they think that I'm just...
- O... okay.
Slow down.
Slow down there, light speed.
We're just talkin' a date.
That's it.
I know.
I know.
Sorry. (Chuckles)
I obviously bring a lot of baggage, and sometimes it just rolls away from me.
Listen, I'll tell you what. (Sighs)
I'm heading back to Austin for a few days.
When I get back,
I'm gettin' us a suite at The Ritz... room service, "do not disturb" on the door.
We can check in under a fictitious name that Carlene can't figure out.
Ohh.
(Chuckles) Mwah.
(Inhales and exhales deeply)
Tudor's sermon got me thinking about
- our little surrogate issue.
(Lowered voice)
- Shh.
(Lowered voice) And I realized there's only one womb that's good enough to carry our progeny.
Taylor Swift is not from Texas.
I'm talkin' about you.
Why outsource when we can go in-house?
We did it the old-fashioned way once.
This dream team can repeat.
Are you talking about... you and me... doing what comes naturally?
Why not?
We're fabulous.
I think you understand better than anyone just how complicated that proposition is.
Last time, it was the '90s.
We were young and drunk.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Things have changed.
Not everything's changed.
I still love you, Crick.
We can do this.
I'm in if you are.
Then let's kick this pig.
(Both chuckle)
Hey, did you hear about the sermon?
I don't know why everybody's weirding out. (Chuckles)
Who cares how many times married people do it?
Wait.
Is it just old people?
I'm not sure about the details... (Chuckles)
But pastor Tudor knows what's up.
Totally.
He's pretty awesome.
Churro?
(Chuckles and crunches)
(Indistinct conversations)
(Heather) When I saw this property, Burl,
I thought of you.
Now you know that I would never pressure you, but full disclosure...
I just booked another showing for this evening, so if you love it, you better jump on it.
It's gonna go fast.
(Rings)
Oh.
Excuse me. (Beep)
Heather Cruz.
Talk to me.
(Lowered voice) You like it?
(Sighs)
Good bones, nice land, great party flow.
You don't think the leather floors are too much?
(Chuckles) For a man with stingray hide on the walls of his yacht?
No, Burl.
It's your style all the way.
(Laughs)
Can you see yourself here?
I'm imagining some very neighborly visits...
Sleepovers, even...
A medicine cabinet filled with a standing supply of very expensive eye cream, which you shall never see me apply.
But do you love it?
Could you be happy here?
(Chuckles) It's your house, Burl.
You're the one who has to be happy here.
Yeah, but I wouldn't be without you.
What are we talking about here?
Are you asking me to move in?
Lord, no.
No, I-I would never.
I... (Chuckles) I would never ask you to spend the night unless... (Inhales deeply)
I was gonna wait for the right time, the perfect time, but Heather's right.
When you find what you want, you have got to jump.
Jumping's the other way.
You've dropped down.
Marry me, Gigi.
(Both panting)
That pastor Tudor is one smart man.
Yeah, sex is so damn divine.
- It's amazing.
- Whew.
Where did you learn to do that thing that you just did?
Well, uh... sometimes when... when things are slow at work,
I watch movies that are... kinda adult.
And things have been really slow lately.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I shouldn't have said that.
I...
I'm sorry.
I...
I f...
I'm kinda embarrassed now. (Chuckles)
Oh, it's okay.
If they... teach you to do... that,
I'm not opposed to educational films.
What else have you learned?
Well... (Clears throat) there was this one move that this lady archaeologist did in "Romancing The Bone"...
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

All right.

That's good.
So... where do we start?
- You don't know Tae Kwon Do?
- Mnh-mnh.
Let's try massage.
No eye contact.
- Ooh, I like rules.
- Mm.
- All right, that good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
That all right?
- Mm-hmm.
(Giggles)
No giggling'.
Giggling is not hot.
Well, I am ticklish there, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I'm sorry, honey.
Um, you know, you wanna try lying down?
On my front or back?
Well, w... uh...
I guess, for you, on your back.
That'd... okay.
(Giggles)
Giggling.
Sorry.
Keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, come on now.
Cricket, I am trying to get in the mood.
I just can't stop wondering, what are you into?
(Sighs) What you wanna know?
Okay.
All right.
Let's say sex was a... was a football game.
Where are you during the snap?
Do you play offense or defense?
Depends on the game.
Fascinating.
You know, this sports metaphor's kind of doing it for me.
That right?
You wanna kickoff or should I?
I will flip you for it.
(Laughs) Oh, Crick.
This is harder than I thought.
Yeah, or not.
(Both laugh)
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
There ain't gonna be any dancing in the end zone tonight.
Nope.
Burl proposed?
(Gasps) What did you say?
I said, "get up off your knee before you hurt yourself."
Then I said I'd have to think about it.
Oh, mama.
Uh...
Burl is crazy about you, and you are crazy about him.
Why didn't you just say yes?
I have been "not married" as long as I was married.
I like "not married" just fine.
I'm not gonna rush into anything again just because some man hands me something sparkly.
Okay.
Well, maybe it is a little fast, but you two both love each other.
Why you have to beat around the bush?
I just don't like feeling pressured to make big decisions.
I don't even buy a car without a test-drive... (Whispers) especially a stick shift.
(Click) Mother.
What?
It's an important part of any relationship.
I'm just taking my cues from the pastor.
You can thank him tomorrow for inspiring me.
(Ace of Base's "The Sign" playing)
Ohh!
(Pants)
- Ooh!
(Panting)
- Look at us.
(Sighs) Oh!
- You play some Ace of Base on the radio...
- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
(Sighs)
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm. (Moans)
(Alarm blaring) (Groans)
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
(Laughs) Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s... (Claps hands) Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda... (Whispers) Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
(Scoffs)
(Key jangle)
(Singsongy) Oh, Zack.
(Click)
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon... (Chair thuds)
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... (Briefcase thuds) is so important... (Keys clatter) at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular. (Mouths word)
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
(Blows air)
Ohh.
Mmm.
(Both moan)
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
(Exhales deeply)
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know... (Grunts)
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
(Sighs deeply) No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
(Sighs)
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
(Gasps) God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
(Plastic bottle crinkles)
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
(Panting)
Ahh!
(Gasps)
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
(Chuckles) I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I... (Chuckles)
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... (Whispers) lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
(Chuckles)
What's the worse thing that could happen?
(Chuckles)
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
(Laughs)
Burl.
(Groans)
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
(Siren wailing, police radio chatter)
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
(Scoffs) I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
(Gigi) What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
(Chuckles) You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
(Chuckles) You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
(Utensils clatter)
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
(Giggles)
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
(Chuckles) What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't... (Clicks tongue and scoffs)
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare." (Scoffs)
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
(Carlene) Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with... (curtain rings swoosh)
- Um...
(Carlene)
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom. (Chuckles)
(Amanda and Carlene gasp)
You here to gloat?
(Sighs) No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... (Whispering) those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
(Normal voice) I guess this isn't shocking to you.
(Chuckles) I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
(Whispers) Ohh.
(Mouths words and inhales deeply)
I cannot tell a lie in church.
(Lowered voice) Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
(Echoing voice) A lot!
(Gasps)
(Lowered voice) There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
(Sighs) I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
(Both laughing)
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
(Chuckles)
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does. (Chuckles)
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
(Inhales deeply) Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
(Clicks switch)
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
(Chuckles)
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
(Whispers indistinctly)
(Whispers) Really?
Twice.
(Gasps)
(Clicks)
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
(Clicks tongue)
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid... (Whispers indistinctly)
(Gasps) Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you... (Whispers indistinctly)
Oval office?
(Voice breaks) I know.
(Exhales deeply)
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
(Chuckles) Isn't it?
(Sighs) Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
(Door closes)
(Crassus) Do you steal, Antoninus?
(Antoninus) No, master.
(Water splashing)
Do you lie?
(Clatters)
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
(Chuckles) I've watched it 200 times.
(Chuckles) You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look. (Chuckles)
Mm. (Chuckles)
(British accent) - "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
(British accent) - "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
(Chuckles)
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."
- and therefore...
- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.
- "of morals."
- "My taste includes..."
- My taste includes...
"both snails..."
both snails and oysters.
"and..."
♪
"oysters."
I... am...
Spartacus.
(Panting)
- Mm.
- Mm.
(Dish clatters, candy rattles)
(Crying)
Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds. (Chuckles)
(Gasps)
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
(Gasps) Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and... (sniffles) they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred." (Mouths words)
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... (Exhales deeply)
(Whispers) is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
(Whispers) I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
(Chuckles) Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
(Laughs)
(Sighs)
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
(Both chuckle)
Oh.
Sorry.
I... (Chuckles)
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
(Closes door)
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
(Sighs) Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh. (Pants)
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.
Hey, get me a real waitress!
Sir, please sit.
You're a danger to yourself and those around you.
Get me another pitcher, hot stuff.
Twin peaks is giving us attitude.
- Is she?
- Yeah.
Ohh!
Her name is Sapphire, and what she'll give you is your check.
Good night.
You ain't gettin' no tip.
Oh, honey, your butt headed out the door is gratuity enough.
Sorry, Amanda.
Hey, Ripp.
I didn't see you come in.
Way to take him down, Amanda.
Well, every now and then you gotta bust some balls.
Oh, God.
Pastor Tudor.
I couldn't agree more.
Matthew 21:12... uh, Jesus threw out thieves and robbers.
Sometimes you gotta cleanse the temple.
I'm a little thrown.
I've never seen you undressed.
Well, he wanted to do a little research for his sermon, so I'm treating him to dinner.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, gotta see a man about a horse.
Well, you know where it is.
No, I mean I gotta talk to Bubba Richardson about buying his horse.
Sermon research?
Here?
About what?
Uh, communication in relationships.
Seems like a lot of married men.
Married guys love coming here, and it ain't for the food.
Well, it's all about sex.
Um, can I get you another beer?
Uh, appetizer?
I'm finding people have a hard time talking about sex.
Don't you?
No, not at all.
Would you like to talk about something else?
That would be divine.
I've been watching you, ever since you moved to town.
You've got such grace under pressure.
You're good with difficult people.
The way you handled those drunks tonight... that... that was just perfect.
Look, I'm sure you get a lot of propositions here, but I'll bet you've never gotten one like this.
And then he offered me a job... church secretary.
I start tomorrow.
Church secretary is the worst job in the world.
How can that be?
All I do is answer the phone and deal with the church stuff and help pastor Tudor, who I like.
Yeah, but you work nights.
Now you'll be working days.
Yeah.
When am I gonna get to see you?
I'll squeeze you in.
All right.
I... are you sure you're ready for this?
I think so.
Maybe we should talk.
Pastor Tudor was saying that communication about sex is key.
Mm.
Hey, hey, hey!
I've been noticing how dark it is down here in the guesthouse, and I've been meaning to bring this lamp, so you could have more light for reading and...
Well-lit activities.
Sis, got company.
I know that, silly.
My security cameras don't miss a thing.
Gotta watch out for unwelcome intruders.
Barn door's open.
Okay.
- To be continued.
- Ohh.
- Carlene.
- Mm.
- As always.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, was I...
Did y'all...
What qualifies you to carry our child?
Oh, well, I'm a triathlete.
I'm vegan.
I've only eaten organic for the last 11 years, and I just love the idea of helping an infertile couple find joy.
- Oh, we are not infertile.
- No.
I am just not in a position to give up alcohol, sushi, or grabbing stimulus dollars for nine months.
You gotta be on your toes for that one.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Emma, you took a year off between hockaday and S.M.U.
- Mm.
- Could you tell us why?
Oh, that was just for the election.
I campaigned for Obama.
We'll be in touch.
Bye-bye now.
Well...
That's it.
The last of our a-list applicants.
We have to widen our search, baby.
We might have to go outside Texas.
No.
We agreed we would not lower our standards.
Maybe there just isn't anyone good enough to carry our baby.
Hey.
Hey.
That is not my girl.
Now we'll find somebody.
Don't you give up hope.
Can I warm up your coffee?
Nah.
How about I top off your tater tots?
No, I'm trying to cut back, maintain control.
Did you know that Blake only eats egg whites ever?
Oh, poor Cricket.
All those yolks gone to waste.
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, can you give me a little bit of that brown, crunchy sugar?
Zack Peacham, you notice my jeans right now!
Hey.
They don't even look like pajama bottoms.
They even got a zipper and everything.
I haven't been able to fit into these bad girls for five years, and I owe it all to the holy word.
Is that fish?
Mm-hmm.
Lemon-grilled, just like Jesus served at Galilee.
At 8:00 in the morning?
Well, it's the only breakfast food that's mentioned in the scriptures.
When I was volunteering for pastor Tudor,
I came across this book, "Foods of the Bible."
The holy land was filled with high fiber and low carb, but you have to be careful of new testament entrees.
They break a lot of bread.
For lunch, I'm doing ground lamb, which my research shows was served at the wedding of King David.
What'd they eat for dessert?
Nothing good, so what I've done is,
I've put a sweet Bible verse in each basket.
Genesis 9:3...
"every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you."
And then each basket is inspired by the one built by Jochebed to float baby Moses down the Nile.
Sharon, you might just be on to something.
I don't recall any fat people in the Bible.
I know, right?
Accountants.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Gotta go.
Basically, you just keep my schedule, oversee booking the church facilities for events, and here's the real, uh, challenge of a church secretary...
I must always be accessible to my congregation, but I also have to have time for pastoral concerns...
- uh, to write sermons.
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta have the wisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.
It can get kinda tricky.
Hey, I worked Boobylicious after the Texas-O.U. game.
Nothing scares me.
I served 18 months in Iraq.
Some of ladies around here do.
Oh.
Amanda, Amanda, Amanda.
Oh.
I just keep walking in on you in the most unnatural situations.
Amanda's the newest addition to my staff.
She's working for you?
You're paying Amanda to do what you got from me for free?
It's the way of the world, darlin'.
Way of the world.
What can we do for you, ladies?
- We?
- Mm-hmm.
John...
Sharon, Cricket, and I have just returned from the Women of the Church Outreach Committee meeting, and we are bursting with ideas we're dying to share with you.
Blake and I would like to establish a scholarship for young, unwed mothers.
We already have an aid program for unwed mothers.
But our program would be for unwed mothers who aren't pregnant yet.
They need to be from the best families with a minimum score of 2,300 on their S.A.T.s.
Gettin' pregnant would be part of the program.
That makes no sense, Cricket.
It makes sense to Blake and me, and we're writing the check.
Oh, and, John...
Do you remember my "condos for Christian living,"
which I was forced to relocate?
Well, uncle Burl has just returned from unincorporated Juarez with some very exciting news...
I'm dying to share with you.
Carlene...
You know how many laws you'd be breaking selling apartments only to christians?
Not in Mexico.
Stay in your lane, sweetie.
I've lost weight.
Can you tell?
Okay, ladies.
The pastor needs to work on his sermon now.
Ladies!
I have a topic.
In fact, it was kinda inspired by a conversation I had with Amanda.
Me?
I see.
I'm sure she's a bottomless pit...
Of inspiration.
But I doubt she's ever gone down a whole dress size 'cause of the Bible.
- Let's go.
- Ladies, give a call, and we'll get a time on the books.
- Uh...
- Uh...
- I have never...
- It's time to go.
Uh...
God be with you, ladies!
Whew.
GCB 1x07
- Sex is Divine Original air date April 8, 2012
So, kids, that's what it means when we say it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Now off you go to Sunday school.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.
So it's just us grown-ups now, right?
'Cause this message is adults-only.
People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"
I'll tell you.
Sex is divine.
Inspired by Amanda.
Surprise, surprise.
Sex is a gift from God.
He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
But look around at the world today.
Are we making the best use of God's gift?
I wonder.
I want to try an experiment for all you committed couples out there.
I'm talkin' married or otherwise entwined.
Now everyone here is an adult, so you can determine if this exercise is for you.
Here's my assignment.
From today till next Sunday,
I'm challenging you all to have sex with your partner once a day, every single day.
Touch each other.
Look into each other's eyes and souls.
Truly share one another, and let's see what happens.
So I was thinkin', for our next date, maybe we don't go to my sister's house.
And we don't go to my house.
Way too much Gigi.
And there's my kids.
I mean, they've never even seen me with another man.
I don't even know how they feel about it.
Will they think that I'm bringing home a new stepdad,
- or will they think that I'm just...
- O... okay.
Slow down.
Slow down there, light speed.
We're just talkin' a date.
That's it.
I know.
I know.
Sorry.
I obviously bring a lot of baggage, and sometimes it just rolls away from me.
Listen, I'll tell you what.
I'm heading back to Austin for a few days.
When I get back,
I'm gettin' us a suite at The Ritz... room service, "do not disturb" on the door.
We can check in under a fictitious name that Carlene can't figure out.
Ohh.
Mwah.
Tudor's sermon got me thinking about
- our little surrogate issue.
- Shh.
And I realized there's only one womb that's good enough to carry our progeny.
Taylor Swift is not from Texas.
I'm talkin' about you.
Why outsource when we can go in-house?
We did it the old-fashioned way once.
This dream team can repeat.
Are you talking about... you and me... doing what comes naturally?
Why not?
We're fabulous.
I think you understand better than anyone just how complicated that proposition is.
Last time, it was the '90s.
We were young and drunk.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Things have changed.
Not everything's changed.
I still love you, Crick.
We can do this.
I'm in if you are.
Then let's kick this pig.
Hey, did you hear about the sermon?
I don't know why everybody's weirding out.
Who cares how many times married people do it?
Wait.
Is it just old people?
I'm not sure about the details...
But pastor Tudor knows what's up.
Totally.
He's pretty awesome.
Churro?
When I saw this property, Burl,
I thought of you.
Now you know that I would never pressure you, but full disclosure...
I just booked another showing for this evening, so if you love it, you better jump on it.
It's gonna go fast.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Heather Cruz.
Talk to me.
You like it?
Good bones, nice land, great party flow.
You don't think the leather floors are too much?
For a man with stingray hide on the walls of his yacht?
No, Burl.
It's your style all the way.
Can you see yourself here?
I'm imagining some very neighborly visits...
Sleepovers, even...
A medicine cabinet filled with a standing supply of very expensive eye cream, which you shall never see me apply.
But do you love it?
Could you be happy here?
It's your house, Burl.
You're the one who has to be happy here.
Yeah, but I wouldn't be without you.
What are we talking about here?
Are you asking me to move in?
Lord, no.
No, I-I would never.
I...
I would never ask you to spend the night unless...
I was gonna wait for the right time, the perfect time, but Heather's right.
When you find what you want, you have got to jump.
Jumping's the other way.
You've dropped down.
Marry me, Gigi.
That pastor Tudor is one smart man.
Yeah, sex is so damn divine.
- It's amazing.
- Whew.
Where did you learn to do that thing that you just did?
Well, uh... sometimes when... when things are slow at work,
I watch movies that are... kinda adult.
And things have been really slow lately.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I shouldn't have said that.
I...
I'm sorry.
I...
I f...
I'm kinda embarrassed now.
Oh, it's okay.
If they... teach you to do... that,
I'm not opposed to educational films.
What else have you learned?
Well... there was this one move that this lady archaeologist did in "Romancing The Bone"...
- Mmm!
- Mmm.
All right.
It's showtime.
That's good.
So... where do we start?
- You don't know Tae Kwon Do?
- Mnh-mnh.
Let's try massage.
No eye contact.
- Ooh, I like rules.
- Mm.
- All right, that good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
That all right?
- Mm-hmm.
No giggling'.
Giggling is not hot.
Well, I am ticklish there, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I'm sorry, honey.
Um, you know, you wanna try lying down?
On my front or back?
Well, w... uh...
I guess, for you, on your back.
That'd... okay.
Giggling.
Sorry.
Keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, come on now.
Cricket, I am trying to get in the mood.
I just can't stop wondering, what are you into?
What you wanna know?
Okay.
All right.
Let's say sex was a... was a football game.
Where are you during the snap?
Do you play offense or defense?
Depends on the game.
Fascinating.
You know, this sports metaphor's kind of doing it for me.
That right?
You wanna kickoff or should I?
I will flip you for it.
Oh, Crick.
This is harder than I thought.
Yeah, or not.
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
There ain't gonna be any dancing in the end zone tonight.
Nope.
Burl proposed?
What did you say?
I said, "get up off your knee before you hurt yourself."
Then I said I'd have to think about it.
Oh, mama.
Uh...
Burl is crazy about you, and you are crazy about him.
Why didn't you just say yes?
I have been "not married" as long as I was married.
I like "not married" just fine.
I'm not gonna rush into anything again just because some man hands me something sparkly.
Okay.
Well, maybe it is a little fast, but you two both love each other.
Why you have to beat around the bush?
I just don't like feeling pressured to make big decisions.
I don't even buy a car without a test-drive... especially a stick shift.
Mother.
What?
It's an important part of any relationship.
I'm just taking my cues from the pastor.
You can thank him tomorrow for inspiring me.
Ohh!
- Ooh!
- Look at us.
Oh!
- You play some Ace of Base on the radio...
- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm.
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s...
Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda...
Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
Oh, Zack.
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon...
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... is so important... at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular.
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
Ohh.
Mmm.
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know...
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
Ahh!
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I...
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
What's the worse thing that could happen?
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
Burl.
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't...
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare."
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with...
- Um...
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom.
You here to gloat?
No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
I guess this isn't shocking to you.
I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
Ohh.
I cannot tell a lie in church.
Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
A lot!
There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
Really?
Twice.
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid...
Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you...
Oval office?
I know.
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
Isn't it?
Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
Do you steal, Antoninus?
No, master.
Do you lie?
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
I've watched it 200 times.
You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look.
Mm.
- "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
- "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."
- and therefore...
- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.
- "of morals."
- "My taste includes..."
- My taste includes...
"both snails..."
both snails and oysters.
"and..."
"oysters."
I... am...
Spartacus.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds.
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and...
they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred."
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
Oh.
Sorry.
I...
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh.
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.
Hey, get me a real waitress!
Sir, please sit.
You're a danger to yourself and those around you.
Get me another pitcher, hot stuff.
Twin peaks is giving us attitude.
- Is she?
- Yeah.
Ohh!
Her name is Sapphire, and what she'll give you is your check.
Good night.
You ain't gettin' no tip.
Oh, honey, your butt headed out the door is gratuity enough.
Sorry, Amanda.
Hey, Ripp.
I didn't see you come in.
Way to take him down, Amanda.
Well, every now and then you gotta bust some balls.
Oh, God.
Pastor Tudor.
I couldn't agree more.
Matthew 21:12... uh, Jesus threw out thieves and robbers.
Sometimes you gotta cleanse the temple.
I'm a little thrown.
I've never seen you undressed.
Well, he wanted to do a little research for his sermon, so I'm treating him to dinner.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, gotta see a man about a horse.
Well, you know where it is.
No, I mean I gotta talk to Bubba Richardson about buying his horse.
Sermon research?
Here?
About what?
Uh, communication in relationships.
Seems like a lot of married men.
Married guys love coming here, and it ain't for the food.
Well, it's all about sex.
Um, can I get you another beer?
Uh, appetizer?
I'm finding people have a hard time talking about sex.
Don't you?
No, not at all.
Would you like to talk about something else?
That would be divine.
I've been watching you, ever since you moved to town.
You've got such grace under pressure.
You're good with difficult people.
The way you handled those drunks tonight... that... that was just perfect.
Look, I'm sure you get a lot of propositions here, but I'll bet you've never gotten one like this.
And then he offered me a job... church secretary.
I start tomorrow.
Church secretary is the worst job in the world.
How can that be?
All I do is answer the phone and deal with the church stuff and help pastor Tudor, who I like.
Yeah, but you work nights.
Now you'll be working days.
Yeah.
When am I gonna get to see you?
I'll squeeze you in.
All right.
I... are you sure you're ready for this?
I think so.
Maybe we should talk.
Pastor Tudor was saying that communication about sex is key.
Mm.
Hey, hey, hey!
I've been noticing how dark it is down here in the guesthouse, and I've been meaning to bring this lamp, so you could have more light for reading and...
Well-lit activities.
Sis, got company.
I know that, silly.
My security cameras don't miss a thing.
Gotta watch out for unwelcome intruders.
Barn door's open.
Okay.
- To be continued.
- Ohh.
- Carlene.
- Mm.
- As always.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, was I...
Did y'all...
What qualifies you to carry our child?
Oh, well, I'm a triathlete.
I'm vegan.
I've only eaten organic for the last 11 years, and I just love the idea of helping an infertile couple find joy.
- Oh, we are not infertile.
- No.
I am just not in a position to give up alcohol, sushi, or grabbing stimulus dollars for nine months.
You gotta be on your toes for that one.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Emma, you took a year off between hockaday and S.M.U.
- Mm.
- Could you tell us why?
Oh, that was just for the election.
I campaigned for Obama.
We'll be in touch.
Bye-bye now.
Well...
That's it.
The last of our a-list applicants.
We have to widen our search, baby.
We might have to go outside Texas.
No.
We agreed we would not lower our standards.
Maybe there just isn't anyone good enough to carry our baby.
Hey.
Hey.
That is not my girl.
Now we'll find somebody.
Don't you give up hope.
Can I warm up your coffee?
Nah.
How about I top off your tater tots?
No, I'm trying to cut back, maintain control.
Did you know that Blake only eats egg whites ever?
Oh, poor Cricket.
All those yolks gone to waste.
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, can you give me a little bit of that brown, crunchy sugar?
Zack Peacham, you notice my jeans right now!
Hey.
They don't even look like pajama bottoms.
They even got a zipper and everything.
I haven't been able to fit into these bad girls for five years, and I owe it all to the holy word.
Is that fish?
Mm-hmm.
Lemon-grilled, just like Jesus served at Galilee.
At 8:00 in the morning?
Well, it's the only breakfast food that's mentioned in the scriptures.
When I was volunteering for pastor Tudor,
I came across this book, "Foods of the Bible."
The holy land was filled with high fiber and low carb, but you have to be careful of new testament entrees.
They break a lot of bread.
For lunch, I'm doing ground lamb, which my research shows was served at the wedding of King David.
What'd they eat for dessert?
Nothing good, so what I've done is,
I've put a sweet Bible verse in each basket.
Genesis 9:3...
"every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you."
And then each basket is inspired by the one built by Jochebed to float baby Moses down the Nile.
Sharon, you might just be on to something.
I don't recall any fat people in the Bible.
I know, right?
Accountants.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Gotta go.
Basically, you just keep my schedule, oversee booking the church facilities for events, and here's the real, uh, challenge of a church secretary...
I must always be accessible to my congregation, but I also have to have time for pastoral concerns...
- uh, to write sermons.
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta have the wisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.
It can get kinda tricky.
Hey, I worked Boobylicious after the Texas-O.U. game.
Nothing scares me.
I served 18 months in Iraq.
Some of ladies around here do.
Oh.
Amanda, Amanda, Amanda.
Oh.
I just keep walking in on you in the most unnatural situations.
Amanda's the newest addition to my staff.
She's working for you?
You're paying Amanda to do what you got from me for free?
It's the way of the world, darlin'.
Way of the world.
What can we do for you, ladies?
- We?
- Mm-hmm.
John...
Sharon, Cricket, and I have just returned from the Women of the Church Outreach Committee meeting, and we are bursting with ideas we're dying to share with you.
Blake and I would like to establish a scholarship for young, unwed mothers.
We already have an aid program for unwed mothers.
But our program would be for unwed mothers who aren't pregnant yet.
They need to be from the best families with a minimum score of 2,300 on their S.A.T.s.
Gettin' pregnant would be part of the program.
That makes no sense, Cricket.
It makes sense to Blake and me, and we're writing the check.
Oh, and, John...
Do you remember my "condos for Christian living,"
which I was forced to relocate?
Well, uncle Burl has just returned from unincorporated Juarez with some very exciting news...
I'm dying to share with you.
Carlene...
You know how many laws you'd be breaking selling apartments only to christians?
Not in Mexico.
Stay in your lane, sweetie.
I've lost weight.
Can you tell?
Okay, ladies.
The pastor needs to work on his sermon now.
Ladies!
I have a topic.
In fact, it was kinda inspired by a conversation I had with Amanda.
Me?
I see.
I'm sure she's a bottomless pit...
Of inspiration.
But I doubt she's ever gone down a whole dress size 'cause of the Bible.
- Let's go.
- Ladies, give a call, and we'll get a time on the books.
- Uh...
- Uh...
- I have never...
- It's time to go.
Uh...
God be with you, ladies!
Whew.
GCB 1x07
- Sex is Divine Original air date April 8, 2012
So, kids, that's what it means when we say it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Now off you go to Sunday school.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.
So it's just us grown-ups now, right?
'Cause this message is adults-only.
People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"
I'll tell you.
Sex is divine.
Inspired by Amanda.
Surprise, surprise.
Sex is a gift from God.
He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
But look around at the world today.
Are we making the best use of God's gift?
I wonder.
I want to try an experiment for all you committed couples out there.
I'm talkin' married or otherwise entwined.
Now everyone here is an adult, so you can determine if this exercise is for you.
Here's my assignment.
From today till next Sunday,
I'm challenging you all to have sex with your partner once a day, every single day.
Touch each other.
Look into each other's eyes and souls.
Truly share one another, and let's see what happens.
So I was thinkin', for our next date, maybe we don't go to my sister's house.
And we don't go to my house.
Way too much Gigi.
And there's my kids.
I mean, they've never even seen me with another man.
I don't even know how they feel about it.
Will they think that I'm bringing home a new stepdad,
- or will they think that I'm just...
- O... okay.
Slow down.
Slow down there, light speed.
We're just talkin' a date.
That's it.
I know.
I know.
Sorry.
I obviously bring a lot of baggage, and sometimes it just rolls away from me.
Listen, I'll tell you what.
I'm heading back to Austin for a few days.
When I get back,
I'm gettin' us a suite at The Ritz... room service, "do not disturb" on the door.
We can check in under a fictitious name that Carlene can't figure out.
Ohh.
Mwah.
Tudor's sermon got me thinking about
- our little surrogate issue.
- Shh.
And I realized there's only one womb that's good enough to carry our progeny.
Taylor Swift is not from Texas.
I'm talkin' about you.
Why outsource when we can go in-house?
We did it the old-fashioned way once.
This dream team can repeat.
Are you talking about... you and me... doing what comes naturally?
Why not?
We're fabulous.
I think you understand better than anyone just how complicated that proposition is.
Last time, it was the '90s.
We were young and drunk.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Things have changed.
Not everything's changed.
I still love you, Crick.
We can do this.
I'm in if you are.
Then let's kick this pig.
Hey, did you hear about the sermon?
I don't know why everybody's weirding out.
Who cares how many times married people do it?
Wait.
Is it just old people?
I'm not sure about the details...
But pastor Tudor knows what's up.
Totally.
He's pretty awesome.
Churro?
When I saw this property, Burl,
I thought of you.
Now you know that I would never pressure you, but full disclosure...
I just booked another showing for this evening, so if you love it, you better jump on it.
It's gonna go fast.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Heather Cruz.
Talk to me.
You like it?
Good bones, nice land, great party flow.
You don't think the leather floors are too much?
For a man with stingray hide on the walls of his yacht?
No, Burl.
It's your style all the way.
Can you see yourself here?
I'm imagining some very neighborly visits...
Sleepovers, even...
A medicine cabinet filled with a standing supply of very expensive eye cream, which you shall never see me apply.
But do you love it?
Could you be happy here?
It's your house, Burl.
You're the one who has to be happy here.
Yeah, but I wouldn't be without you.
What are we talking about here?
Are you asking me to move in?
Lord, no.
No, I-I would never.
I...
I would never ask you to spend the night unless...
I was gonna wait for the right time, the perfect time, but Heather's right.
When you find what you want, you have got to jump.
Jumping's the other way.
You've dropped down.
Marry me, Gigi.
That pastor Tudor is one smart man.
Yeah, sex is so damn divine.
- It's amazing.
- Whew.
Where did you learn to do that thing that you just did?
Well, uh... sometimes when... when things are slow at work,
I watch movies that are... kinda adult.
And things have been really slow lately.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I shouldn't have said that.
I...
I'm sorry.
I...
I f...
I'm kinda embarrassed now.
Oh, it's okay.
If they... teach you to do... that,
I'm not opposed to educational films.
What else have you learned?
Well... there was this one move that this lady archaeologist did in "Romancing The Bone"...
- Mmm!
- Mmm.
All right.
It's showtime.
That's good.
So... where do we start?
- You don't know Tae Kwon Do?
- Mnh-mnh.
Let's try massage.
No eye contact.
- Ooh, I like rules.
- Mm.
- All right, that good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
That all right?
- Mm-hmm.
No giggling'.
Giggling is not hot.
Well, I am ticklish there, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I'm sorry, honey.
Um, you know, you wanna try lying down?
On my front or back?
Well, w... uh...
I guess, for you, on your back.
That'd... okay.
Giggling.
Sorry.
Keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, come on now.
Cricket, I am trying to get in the mood.
I just can't stop wondering, what are you into?
What you wanna know?
Okay.
All right.
Let's say sex was a... was a football game.
Where are you during the snap?
Do you play offense or defense?
Depends on the game.
Fascinating.
You know, this sports metaphor's kind of doing it for me.
That right?
You wanna kickoff or should I?
I will flip you for it.
Oh, Crick.
This is harder than I thought.
Yeah, or not.
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
There ain't gonna be any dancing in the end zone tonight.
Nope.
Burl proposed?
What did you say?
I said, "get up off your knee before you hurt yourself."
Then I said I'd have to think about it.
Oh, mama.
Uh...
Burl is crazy about you, and you are crazy about him.
Why didn't you just say yes?
I have been "not married" as long as I was married.
I like "not married" just fine.
I'm not gonna rush into anything again just because some man hands me something sparkly.
Okay.
Well, maybe it is a little fast, but you two both love each other.
Why you have to beat around the bush?
I just don't like feeling pressured to make big decisions.
I don't even buy a car without a test-drive... especially a stick shift.
Mother.
What?
It's an important part of any relationship.
I'm just taking my cues from the pastor.
You can thank him tomorrow for inspiring me.
Ohh!
- Ooh!
- Look at us.
Oh!
- You play some Ace of Base on the radio...
- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm.
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s...
Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda...
Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
Oh, Zack.
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon...
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... is so important... at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular.
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
Ohh.
Mmm.
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know...
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
Ahh!
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I...
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
What's the worse thing that could happen?
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
Burl.
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't...
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare."
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with...
- Um...
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom.
You here to gloat?
No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
I guess this isn't shocking to you.
I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
Ohh.
I cannot tell a lie in church.
Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
A lot!
There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
Really?
Twice.
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid...
Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you...
Oval office?
I know.
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
Isn't it?
Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
Do you steal, Antoninus?
No, master.
Do you lie?
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
I've watched it 200 times.
You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look.
Mm.
- "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
- "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."
- and therefore...
- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.
- "of morals."
- "My taste includes..."
- My taste includes...
"both snails..."
both snails and oysters.
"and..."
"oysters."
I... am...
Spartacus.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds.
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and...
they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred."
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
Oh.
Sorry.
I...
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh.
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.

Twin peaks is giving us attitude.

(Laughs)
(Grunts) Ohh!
(Groans, panting) Her name is Sapphire, and what she'll give you is your check.
Good night.
(Strained voice) You ain't gettin' no tip.
Oh, honey, your butt headed out the door is gratuity enough.
(Man) Sorry, Amanda.
Hey, Ripp.
I didn't see you come in.
Way to take him down, Amanda.
Well, every now and then you gotta bust some balls.
(Chuckles) Oh, God.
Pastor Tudor.
I couldn't agree more.
Matthew 21:12... uh, Jesus threw out thieves and robbers.
Sometimes you gotta cleanse the temple.
I'm a little thrown.
I've never seen you undressed.
Well, he wanted to do a little research for his sermon, so I'm treating him to dinner.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, gotta see a man about a horse.
Well, you know where it is. (Chuckles)
No, I mean I gotta talk to Bubba Richardson about buying his horse.
Sermon research?
Here?
About what?
Uh, communication in relationships.
Seems like a lot of married men. (Chuckles)
Married guys love coming here, and it ain't for the food.
Well, it's all about sex.
Um, can I get you another beer?
Uh, appetizer?
I'm finding people have a hard time talking about sex.
Don't you?
No, not at all.
(Chuckles) I've been watching you, ever since you moved to town.
You've got such grace under pressure.
You're good with difficult people.
The way you handled those drunks tonight... that... that was just perfect.
Look, I'm sure you get a lot of propositions here, but I'll bet you've never gotten one like this.
And then he offered me a job... church secretary.
I start tomorrow.
Church secretary is the worst job in the world.
How can that be?
(Chuckles)
All I do is answer the phone and deal with the church stuff and help pastor Tudor, who I like.
Yeah, but you work nights.
Now you'll be working days.
Yeah.
When am I gonna get to see you?
(Whispers) I'll squeeze you in.
(Sighs)
All right.
I... are you sure you're ready for this?
(Whispers) I think so.
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
Maybe we should talk.
Pastor Tudor was saying that communication about sex is key. (Sighs)
(Both panting)
Mm.
(Both chuckle)
(Door closes)
Hey, hey, hey!
I've been noticing how dark it is down here in the guesthouse, and I've been meaning to bring this lamp, so you could have more light for reading and... (Click) Well-lit activities.
Sis, got company.
I know that, silly.
My security cameras don't miss a thing.
(Chuckles) Gotta watch out for unwelcome intruders.
Barn door's open.
(Laughs) Okay.
- To be continued.
- Ohh.
- Carlene.
- Mm.
- As always.
- Mm-hmm.
(Gasps) Oh, was I...
Did y'all...
What qualifies you to carry our child?
Oh, well, I'm a triathlete.
I'm vegan.
I've only eaten organic for the last 11 years, and I just love the idea of helping an infertile couple find joy.
- Oh, we are not infertile.
(Chuckles)
- No.
I am just not in a position to give up alcohol, sushi, or grabbing stimulus dollars for nine months.
You gotta be on your toes for that one.
Mm-hmm. (Chuckles)
Uh, Emma, you took a year off between hockaday and S.M.U.
- Mm.
- Could you tell us why?
Oh, that was just for the election.
(Chuckles)
I campaigned for Obama.
We'll be in touch.
Bye-bye now.
(Mouths word)
Well... (Sighs) That's it.
The last of our a-list applicants.
We have to widen our search, baby.
(File clatters)
We might have to go outside Texas.
No.
We agreed we would not lower our standards.
Maybe there just isn't anyone good enough to carry our baby.
Hey.
Hey.
That is not my girl.
Now we'll find somebody.
Don't you give up hope.
Can I warm up your coffee?
Nah.
How about I top off your tater tots?
(Clangs)
No, I'm trying to cut back, maintain control.
Did you know that Blake only eats egg whites ever?
Oh, poor Cricket.
All those yolks gone to waste.
(Clears throat)
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, can you give me a little bit of that brown, crunchy sugar?
Zack Peacham, you notice my jeans right now!
Hey.
They don't even look like pajama bottoms.
They even got a zipper and everything.
I haven't been able to fit into these bad girls for five years, and I owe it all to the holy word.
Is that fish?
Mm-hmm.
Lemon-grilled, just like Jesus served at Galilee.
At 8:00 in the morning?
Well, it's the only breakfast food that's mentioned in the scriptures.
When I was volunteering for pastor Tudor,
I came across this book, "Foods of the Bible."
The holy land was filled with high fiber and low carb, but you have to be careful of new testament entrees.
They break a lot of bread.
For lunch, I'm doing ground lamb, which my research shows was served at the wedding of King David.
What'd they eat for dessert?
Nothing good, so what I've done is,
I've put a sweet Bible verse in each basket.
Genesis 9:3...
"every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you."
And then each basket is inspired by the one built by Jochebed to float baby Moses down the Nile.
Sharon, you might just be on to something.
I don't recall any fat people in the Bible.
I know, right?
(Rings)
(Clears throat) Accountants.
(Sighs)
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Gotta go.
Basically, you just keep my schedule, oversee booking the church facilities for events, and here's the real, uh, challenge of a church secretary...
I must always be accessible to my congregation, but I also have to have time for pastoral concerns...
- uh, to write sermons.
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta have the wisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.
(Chuckles) It can get kinda tricky.
Hey, I worked Boobylicious after the Texas-O.U. game.
Nothing scares me.
I served 18 months in Iraq.
Some of ladies around here do.
(Carlene, Cricket, and Sharon speak indistinctly)
Oh.
Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. (Chuckles) Oh.
I just keep walking in on you in the most unnatural situations.
(Amanda chuckles)
Amanda's the newest addition to my staff.
She's working for you?
You're paying Amanda to do what you got from me for free?
It's the way of the world, darlin'.
Way of the world.
(Sighs) What can we do for you, ladies?
- We?
(Chuckles)
- Mm-hmm.
John...
Sharon, Cricket, and I have just returned from the Women of the Church Outreach Committee meeting, and we are bursting with ideas we're dying to share with you. (Sighs)
Blake and I would like to establish a scholarship for young, unwed mothers.
We already have an aid program for unwed mothers.
But our program would be for unwed mothers who aren't pregnant yet.
They need to be from the best families with a minimum score of 2,300 on their S.A.T.s.
Gettin' pregnant would be part of the program.
That makes no sense, Cricket.
It makes sense to Blake and me, and we're writing the check.
Oh, and, John... (Grunts) Do you remember my "condos for Christian living,"
which I was forced to relocate?
Well, uncle Burl has just returned from unincorporated Juarez with some very exciting news... (Whispers) I'm dying to share with you.
Carlene... (Sighs)
You know how many laws you'd be breaking selling apartments only to christians?
Not in Mexico.
Stay in your lane, sweetie.
I've lost weight.
Can you tell?
Okay, ladies.
The pastor needs to work on his sermon now.
(Carlene, Cricket, and Sharon speaking indistinctly)
Ladies!
I have a topic.
In fact, it was kinda inspired by a conversation I had with Amanda.
Me?
I see.
I'm sure she's a bottomless pit...
Of inspiration.
But I doubt she's ever gone down a whole dress size 'cause of the Bible.
- Let's go.
- Ladies, give a call, and we'll get a time on the books.
- Uh...
(Scoffs)
- Uh...
- I have never...
- It's time to go.
(Women speaking indistinctly)
Uh...
God be with you, ladies!

GCB 1x07
- Sex is Divine Original air date April 8, 2012
So, kids, that's what it means when we say it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
(Cricket and Carlene mouth words)
Now off you go to Sunday school.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.
(Indistinct conversations)
So it's just us grown-ups now, right?
(Door closes)
'Cause this message is adults-only.
People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"
I'll tell you.
Sex is divine.
(Congregation murmuring)
(Lowered voice) Inspired by Amanda.
(Lowered voice) Surprise, surprise.
Sex is a gift from God.
He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
But look around at the world today.
Are we making the best use of God's gift?
I wonder.
I want to try an experiment for all you committed couples out there.
I'm talkin' married or otherwise entwined.
Now everyone here is an adult, so you can determine if this exercise is for you.
Here's my assignment.
From today till next Sunday,
I'm challenging you all to have sex with your partner once a day, every single day.
Touch each other.
Look into each other's eyes and souls.
Truly share one another, and let's see what happens.
(Bells tolling)
So I was thinkin', for our next date, maybe we don't go to my sister's house.
And we don't go to my house. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles) Way too much Gigi.
And there's my kids.
I mean, they've never even seen me with another man.
I don't even know how they feel about it.
Will they think that I'm bringing home a new stepdad,
- or will they think that I'm just...
- O... okay.
Slow down.
Slow down there, light speed.
We're just talkin' a date.
That's it.
I know.
I know.
Sorry. (Chuckles)
I obviously bring a lot of baggage, and sometimes it just rolls away from me.
Listen, I'll tell you what. (Sighs)
I'm heading back to Austin for a few days.
When I get back,
I'm gettin' us a suite at The Ritz... room service, "do not disturb" on the door.
We can check in under a fictitious name that Carlene can't figure out.
Ohh.
(Chuckles) Mwah.
(Inhales and exhales deeply)
Tudor's sermon got me thinking about
- our little surrogate issue.
(Lowered voice)
- Shh.
(Lowered voice) And I realized there's only one womb that's good enough to carry our progeny.
Taylor Swift is not from Texas.
I'm talkin' about you.
Why outsource when we can go in-house?
We did it the old-fashioned way once.
This dream team can repeat.
Are you talking about... you and me... doing what comes naturally?
Why not?
We're fabulous.
I think you understand better than anyone just how complicated that proposition is.
Last time, it was the '90s.
We were young and drunk.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Things have changed.
Not everything's changed.
I still love you, Crick.
We can do this.
I'm in if you are.
Then let's kick this pig.
(Both chuckle)
Hey, did you hear about the sermon?
I don't know why everybody's weirding out. (Chuckles)
Who cares how many times married people do it?
Wait.
Is it just old people?
I'm not sure about the details... (Chuckles)
But pastor Tudor knows what's up.
Totally.
He's pretty awesome.
Churro?
(Chuckles and crunches)
(Indistinct conversations)
(Heather) When I saw this property, Burl,
I thought of you.
Now you know that I would never pressure you, but full disclosure...
I just booked another showing for this evening, so if you love it, you better jump on it.
It's gonna go fast.
(Rings)
Oh.
Excuse me. (Beep)
Heather Cruz.
Talk to me.
(Lowered voice) You like it?
(Sighs)
Good bones, nice land, great party flow.
You don't think the leather floors are too much?
(Chuckles) For a man with stingray hide on the walls of his yacht?
No, Burl.
It's your style all the way.
(Laughs)
Can you see yourself here?
I'm imagining some very neighborly visits...
Sleepovers, even...
A medicine cabinet filled with a standing supply of very expensive eye cream, which you shall never see me apply.
But do you love it?
Could you be happy here?
(Chuckles) It's your house, Burl.
You're the one who has to be happy here.
Yeah, but I wouldn't be without you.
What are we talking about here?
Are you asking me to move in?
Lord, no.
No, I-I would never.
I... (Chuckles) I would never ask you to spend the night unless... (Inhales deeply)
I was gonna wait for the right time, the perfect time, but Heather's right.
When you find what you want, you have got to jump.
Jumping's the other way.
You've dropped down.
Marry me, Gigi.
(Both panting)
That pastor Tudor is one smart man.
Yeah, sex is so damn divine.
- It's amazing.
- Whew.
Where did you learn to do that thing that you just did?
Well, uh... sometimes when... when things are slow at work,
I watch movies that are... kinda adult.
And things have been really slow lately.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I shouldn't have said that.
I...
I'm sorry.
I...
I f...
I'm kinda embarrassed now. (Chuckles)
Oh, it's okay.
If they... teach you to do... that,
I'm not opposed to educational films.
What else have you learned?
Well... (Clears throat) there was this one move that this lady archaeologist did in "Romancing The Bone"...
- Mmm!
- Mmm.
(Don Derby) ♪ Hey, babe, whatcha say?
♪
♪ let's go down and roll in the hay, come on!

(Spritzing)
♪ Hey, babe, whatcha say?
♪
♪ let's go down and... ♪ (Beep)
All right.
♪ I was thinking maybe we can get crazy ♪
♪ just you and me, baby ♪
It's showtime.
♪ I'm your man, you're my girl ♪
That's good.
So... where do we start?
- You don't know Tae Kwon Do?
- Mnh-mnh.
Let's try massage.
No eye contact.
- Ooh, I like rules.
- Mm.
- All right, that good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
That all right?
- Mm-hmm.
(Giggles)
No giggling'.
Giggling is not hot.
Well, I am ticklish there, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I'm sorry, honey.
Um, you know, you wanna try lying down?
On my front or back?
Well, w... uh...
I guess, for you, on your back.
That'd... okay.
(Giggles)
Giggling.
Sorry.
Keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, come on now.
Cricket, I am trying to get in the mood.
I just can't stop wondering, what are you into?
(Sighs) What you wanna know?
Okay.
All right.
Let's say sex was a... was a football game.
Where are you during the snap?
Do you play offense or defense?
Depends on the game.
Fascinating.
You know, this sports metaphor's kind of doing it for me.
That right?
You wanna kickoff or should I?
I will flip you for it.
(Laughs) Oh, Crick.
This is harder than I thought.
Yeah, or not.
(Both laugh)
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
There ain't gonna be any dancing in the end zone tonight.
Nope.
Burl proposed?
(Gasps) What did you say?
I said, "get up off your knee before you hurt yourself."
Then I said I'd have to think about it.
Oh, mama.
Uh...
Burl is crazy about you, and you are crazy about him.
Why didn't you just say yes?
I have been "not married" as long as I was married.
I like "not married" just fine.
I'm not gonna rush into anything again just because some man hands me something sparkly.
Okay.
Well, maybe it is a little fast, but you two both love each other.
Why you have to beat around the bush?
I just don't like feeling pressured to make big decisions.
I don't even buy a car without a test-drive... (Whispers) especially a stick shift.
(Click) Mother.
What?
It's an important part of any relationship.
I'm just taking my cues from the pastor.
You can thank him tomorrow for inspiring me.
(Ace of Base's "The Sign" playing)
Ohh!
(Pants)
- Ooh!
(Panting)
- Look at us.
(Sighs) Oh!
- You play some Ace of Base on the radio...
- Huh.
and it's like high school all over again.
(Sighs)
Do you think I'm fat?
What?
No, you are not.
You are better than me.
Oh.
I mean... no.
You... you try so hard to make us work, and I just... let things slip.
I mean, I... let my body go.
I let our marriage go.
I let my...
What?
No.
Don't stop now.
No, it's weird.
I keep wanting to talk after sex.
It's like I'm turning into a... a woman.
It's beautiful.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, now.
Mm!
Mmm. (Moans)
(Alarm blaring) (Groans)
She said it inspired her?
Mm-hmm.
And Gigi's not the only one talking about the sermon.
You have gotten 46 calls since lunch.
Ignoring the 12 from Carlene, that puts us at 16 pro, 18 against.
Nothing brings out the passion of a community like controversy.
Okay.
Time to get my fingers a-dialing.
Excuse me?
I'm from the 2:00 land of milk and mommies breast-feeding class, and Carlene Cockburn just kicked us out of the fellowship hall.
Ah, ah.
What's going on in here, Carlene?
Yes!
In light of the pastor's sermon,
I decided our community's youth needed a pure influence.
So I founded Hillside Park Purity Pioneers.
(Laughs) Or H.P.P.P.
Pioneers... come, come.
I want you to read your pledges.
Ready?
Landry?
Son?
You can start.
- Hello, Mrs. V.
- Landry!
As a purity pioneer, I make a commitment to God, to myself, my family, and to my friends... to my future mate and my future children to a lifetime of purity.
I will refrain from fantasizing, talking about, or have sexual intercourse from this day on until the day I marry... or a thousand years from now, whichever comes first.
Seriously?
A thousand years?
Science is very advanced these days... if you believe in that kind of thing.
P.P.s... (Claps hands) Thank you.
Okay, here's the deal.
The fellowship hall was signed up several weeks ago in advance for the land of milk and mommies classes.
I recognize that they usually use the fellowship hall for that.
But I didn't think exposed bosoms were appropriate the first day of my soon-to-be annual purity week.
And the sound of anything suckling is... just gross.
You didn't sign up for the room, so I have to shut you down.
- Sorry.
- Amanda... (Whispers) Yes?
Why do you hate purity?
I don't hate purity.
I'm just a stickler for the rules.
Okay, everybody, out!
You'll have to pretend sex doesn't exist somewhere else.
I...
I never imagined that I'd be persecuted inside my own church!
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
Dramatic?
I have a right to be here.
Do you?
Where is it carved in stone that this room belongs to you?
See?
You can't kick me out.
Paper covers rock.
You have five minutes to clear up or I'll call security.
(Scoffs)
(Key jangle)
(Singsongy) Oh, Zack.
(Click)
Sharon?
I went online today and I watched "Romancing The Bone."
Fascinatingly naughty.
Sharon... (Chair thuds)
I have been waiting for you to come home all night so we can do a little archaeological digging.
Now what... (Briefcase thuds) is so important... (Keys clatter) at work that's keeping you away from your loving, lovely wife?
Big day, big deals.
Super savings spectacular. (Mouths word)
All 2011 models must go.
Well, I called your secretary, and she said things were quiet.
I can't.
I'm afraid.
You have a fearsome power over me in bed, and it's just too much.
(Blows air)
Ohh.
Mmm.
(Both moan)
Zack, you know how you've been all warm and open after sex and wanna talk about your feelings and your needs and your wants?
Makes you wanna barf, right?
No!
It's just the opposite.
Makes me wanna open up to you, too.
And I've just been thinking, well, now there's something missing in our family.
And, you know,
Bozeman and Mckinney are gonna be gone soon, and I'd really like to have a... outdoor pizza oven.
And that way, I can bake like the israelites.
(Exhales deeply)
And I think we could do it for about $50,000.
Or I could just get a new blender.
You know... (Grunts)
I would shower you with diamonds and pizza ovens and gold-plated blenders if I could, but I just can't.
We're in the hole.
What do you mean?
I'm not the only NFL vet selling cars in Dallas anymore.
The... damn fullback from the Texans has been poaching all my business.
I mean...
The Texans.
Come on!
The dealership is going under.
Oh, my lord.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything to you.
(Sighs deeply) No, but after sex, you can't help yourself.
Oh, it just feels so good to get it off my chest.
(Sighs)
And what are those?
A very natural and very expensive solution to our reproductive problems, courtesy of Dr. Wang of Lijiang, Yunnan Province.
That's China.
I'm listening.
You're looking at a mixture of 14 herbs, 16 minerals, shark pheromones, and an orchid everybody thinks is extinct.
Apparently, we won't be able to keep our hands off each other.
Let's take these babies and make us some babies.
Why is it so hot in here?
I've got the air set to frigid.
(Gasps) God, I am so thirsty.
I don't get it.
They're organic.
They give 'me to pandas to get 'em to breed!
If this is what it takes for pandas to hump, no wonder they're almost extinct!
Don't yell at me!
I'm just trying to get us in the mood!
What are you doing to help?
I am trying not to have an aneurysm!
(Plastic bottle crinkles)
Mm.
Ugh!
I need to drink the Gulf of Mexico!
(Panting)
Ahh!
(Gasps)
I do not... feel sexy.
Burl, darling.
Where are you?
Push your plate back and come see for yourself.
Gigi Stopper, you are... beautiful.
But what are you doing?
Why don't you come on up here?
And I think you'll figure it out.
Oh, I take one step in your direction, it's gonna be hanky-panky all the way.
What about your grandkids?
Laura's sleeping over with a friend.
Will's got headphones and a new wraparound plasma screen TV.
And never say the word "grandkids"
to a welcoming woman in a negligee.
What about Amanda?
Out.
What about my proposal?
You know I need a little more time on that, Burl.
(Chuckles) I like my life.
I like sharing it with you, exclusively, intimately.
Can't that be enough for now?
No.
I believe what we could have, what we could do, what... what I... (Chuckles)
I could do to you right now belongs in a marriage.
And I believe it belongs to us to do with as we choose, respectfully... (Whispers) lovingly.
I think you should stop right there before I surrender to temptation.
And I think you should get up here right now before I change my mind.
(Chuckles)
What's the worse thing that could happen?
(Chuckles)
Oh, yeah.
Burl.
(Laughs)
Burl.
(Groans)
Burl!
Oh!
Oh!
Heavens!
(Siren wailing, police radio chatter)
Burl?
I'll see you at the hospital!
You hear me, Burl Lourd?
I'll see you real soon!
I'll see you real soon.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
What are you wearing?
Oh, this?
Miss Carlene gave it to me.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Why?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is you becoming a purity pioneer.
What are you thinking?
(Scoffs) I was thinking my mother wouldn't care if I joined an organization that promoted abstinence.
I don't mind abstinence.
It just has to go hand in hand with education.
Carlene's organization isn't interested in that.
Alexandra and Mckinney asked me to join.
If I said no, I'd wind up in popularity jail.
Okay, but, honey, you know... we can talk about sex if you want.
I was a teenage mom.
Let me be an example for you.
Don't take this the wrong way...
I don't wanna talk about your sex life when you were my age, now, or ever.
I have a pioneer meeting to go to.
Excuse me.
(Gigi) What is that you're eating?
Beans, rice, melted cheese, and some very salty meat.
I had a glitch in my pacemaker.
Doctors give it a twist or a jolt or whatever they do, and I'm fine.
Well, thank the good lord... and the desk nurse who told me you'd checked out.
I know you're mad, Burl, and I was wrong and pigheaded and clinging to my independence when what I would've been doing was holding on to you.
The answer is yes.
Answer to what?
Your proposal.
(Chuckles) You're just saying yes because of my bum ticker.
It's a pity yes.
It's not a pity yes.
It's a real yes.
And just the other day, it was, "I need more time."
You know when I say that, Gigi?
During business negotiations when I have respect for my opponent but not the deal.
It means "no."
Burl... how can I count on you?
(Chuckles) You're here, worried about my heart, and you don't even know your own.
Proposal's off the table.
Then so is this.
You can share your new home and your new grotto with whoever you please, but not a gordita.
Believe it or not, I care about you, and I will not have you eating your way into an early grave.
There's more where that came from.
But there's only one me.
(Utensils clatter)
Honey, I need you to set that box of props out in the hall.
And open this up.
I need a good flow past the "perils of promiscuity" attraction.
Ripp!
Carlene, why did you suck my daughter into your creepy celibacy club?
I can handle sex educating my teen, thank you very much.
Kind of busy here.
- What...
- Ripp, darling, that goes outside so we can welcome our visitors.
That's where it was goin', kitten.
(Giggles)
What the hell is a heck house?
It is a realistic representation of the consequences of premarital promiscuity designed to send our community's youth down a righteous path.
Now I'm bussing in kids from all over the city to witness the horrors of teenage sex.
The mormons call this H-E-double hockey sticks house, but I'm not that liberal.
Get on about yourself.
Oh, hi!
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- Hi!
(Chuckles) What is this about?
Oh, Carlene asked Bozeman to represent gonorrhea, the silent killer.
And kudos on Bozeman's hickey makeup, Sharon.
It's so realistic.
Makeup?
I didn't... (Clicks tongue and scoffs)
Bozeman!
I'll just go wait with the other S.T.D.s.
Let me get this straight.
You are trying to scare our children into being celibate?
Where would you like this, kitten?
"Roofie nightmare." (Scoffs)
Okay, okay.
If you want to fill your kid's mind with horror stories, that is up to you...
- Where are my girls?
- ...but leave mine out of it.
- Shh.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh!
And here are our little streetwalkers!
- Huh?
It was so sweet of you to loan them your clothes, Heather.
Do all whores wear couture?
Oh, is she playing our madam?
Good idea, Alexandra.
Perfect casting.
I... you should get to makeup.
Makeup, makeup.
We got Heather comin', makeup.
Shove it, Carlene.
This is for charity.
I'm not a whore.
Okay, you know what?
Carlene, all you're doing here is demonizing sex, making it out to be something horrible and dirty.
Why can't we just be honest with them about how to prevent these things?
Oh, Amanda, sweet Amanda, this is America.
Fear works better.
Oh, my God, Carlene.
(Carlene) Girls, hang that outside.
Carlene.
You said you were holding a simple seminar on the ramifications of premarital sex.
I appreciate the message, but this is extreme.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of secretarial influence Amanda has you under, but with all due respect, after your sermon last Sunday,
I don't think anything is too extreme when it comes to the safety and future of our children.
I'm not telling you how to raise your kids.
- Good.
- I'm just telling you, you can't recreate Sodom and Gomorrah in here.
Take this all down, please.
Thank you very much, pastor Tudor.
- I hardly think this is Sodom and Gomorrah, John.
- Laura, you're coming home!
Girls, please put some clothes on.
- You're going into herpes.
- Are you...
- No, that's crabs.
- Laura, you're coming home with... (curtain rings swoosh)
- Um...
(Carlene)
- Landry!
Laura!
Hey, mom. (Chuckles)
(Amanda and Carlene gasp)
You here to gloat?
(Sighs) No, Carlene.
I don't think either one of us wants our kids having sex.
At least we caught them before it could go very far.
What difference does it make?
Clearly my message didn't sink in.
My son is headed down the path toward being one of... (Whispering) those boys, and your daughter... she's gonna be one of those girls.
(Normal voice) I guess this isn't shocking to you.
(Chuckles) I came in here to try to find some common ground with you, but I am so sick of you saying I am a fallen woman.
Do you want to know what?
I have only ever had sex with one man... my husband Bill.
So not even with Luke?
Not yet.
Well, I guess I misjudged you.
Maybe it's the way you dress.
We're not so different.
I mean, you've only ever been with Ripp.
You... you... have only ever been with Ripp, right?
(Whispers) Ohh.
(Mouths words and inhales deeply)
I cannot tell a lie in church.
(Lowered voice) Before I came into the fold,
I... sinned a little bit.
(Echoing voice) A lot!
(Gasps)
(Lowered voice) There was a time in my youth when I needed affirmation, and I sought it in all the wrong places.
- I can't believe it.
- Let me be clear.
Only my beloved husband has ever gotten to home plate, but there are boys that made it to other bases.
Some even ran around in the outfield a bit.
Oh, I really, really can't believe it.
I guess when I heard the pastor's speech, my past came flooding back.
I would give anything to keep young ladies like your Laura from making my mistakes.
See, I wish she could hear that story.
I think that would mean a whole lot more to her than a heck house full of fake scares.
Then why don't you tell her what you've gone through?
You know kids.
They can't hear the truth if it comes from their own parents.
- Don't I know it?
- Right?
Try as I might to scare Landry onto the right path, he just won't take me seriously.
You know what?
We might be able to help each other out.
Heather?
You here?
No.
She asked you to come over as a favor to me.
Well, I guess I'm not signing any closing documents today.
(Sighs) I should go, Gigi.
We've said everything there is to say.
Come on, Burl.
You think I go runnin' around willy-nilly, asking women to marry me, hmm?
You know, it's not something I take lightly.
I know I hurt your pride, but there's no reason to let that or my stubbornness get in the way.
I love ya.
You know that, so here's how it's gonna work.
At your discretion, you are going to ask me to marry you again.
This time I will say yes without hesitation and not out of pity, because I know a perfect thing when I see it.
Fine.
I returned the ring.
Fine.
We'll go up a carat.
(Both laughing)
Now how about that hanky-panky?
You're on.
My son obviously likes you.
(Chuckles)
It feels good when a boy likes you, doesn't it?
It sure does. (Chuckles)
Be careful.
It's a dangerous time when you're young and your hormones aren't in pill form.
(Inhales deeply) Here goes.
Carlene Cockburn... cautionary tale.
Mrs. Vaughn?
I heard you wanted to see me.
(Clicks switch)
Landry.
Cort Highlander was the first boy that ever asked me out.
Sophomore dance.
(Chuckles)
God hadn't seen fit to sculpt me into the porcelain perfection that I am now.
Oh, I wanted Cort to like me so much that after the dance, we went behind the bleachers, and I let him stick his...
(Whispers indistinctly)
(Whispers) Really?
Twice.
(Gasps)
(Clicks)
You know about my husband, right?
Uh, that money guy who died?
Did you know he started out as a QB1 for the Hillside High Hornets...
your very same position?
He had quite a bright future until he got his girlfriend pregnant and ran off to California with her.
(Clicks tongue)
Are you talking about you?
Mm.
Then there was Jack Massey, a senior.
Alls we did was go to the Burger Shack, but right there... in the parking lot...
Oh, uh, I don't know what happened to my self-esteem.
I slid... (Whispers indistinctly)
(Gasps) Ohh.
No way.
It takes two hands to handle a whopper.
I wasn't much older than you when I had Laura.
God, how Bill must have felt, married to his high school sweetheart, and staring down the barrel of the rest of his life.
I don't have a daughter, Laura, but if I did,
I'd tell her exactly what I'm telling you right now.
Honey, you don't want a boy like Landry to dump you when he's done with you, and you don't want the boys' Varsity Lacrosse team to call you... (Whispers indistinctly)
Oval office?
(Voice breaks) I know.
(Exhales deeply)
Do you know what the problem was?
Bill never got a chance to sow his wild oats before becoming a dad, and do you know how he dealt with it?
He cheated on me with my best friend, and then he cheated his investors, and then he got his junk bitten off, and then he died.
Oh, that's... dude, that's wrong.
(Chuckles) Isn't it?
(Sighs) Ohh.
So you and Laura... you two gonna take it slow or what?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, honey.
Did you and miss Carlene have a good talk?
Wonderful.
Landry, say good night.
(Door closes)
(Crassus) Do you steal, Antoninus?
(Antoninus) No, master.
(Water splashing)
Do you lie?
(Clatters)
I like your style.
- Mm.
- Hit me.
Not if I can avoid it.
I must have watched "Spartacus" 100 times.
(Chuckles) I've watched it 200 times.
(Chuckles) You think they really fought wars like this in olden days, all naked and oiled up?
Yes, master.
It's a good look. (Chuckles)
Mm. (Chuckles)
(British accent) - "Do you eat oysters?"
- Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
(British accent) - "Do you eat snails?"
- Do you eat snails?
(Chuckles)
No, master.
- "Do you consider..."
- Do you consider...
- "The eating of oysters..."
- The eating of oysters...
- "To be moral..."
- To be moral, and the eating of snails...
- "and the eating of snails to be immoral?" - to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
- "It's all a matter..."
- It is all a matter
- of taste, isn't it?
- "of taste."
- "And taste is not the same..."
- And taste is not the same
- as appetite...
- "as appetite..."
- and therefore...
- "therefore, it's not a question..."
- not a question of morals.
- "of morals."
- "My taste includes..."
- My taste includes...
"both snails..."
both snails and oysters.
"and..."
♪
"oysters."
I... am...
Spartacus.
(Panting)
- Mm.
- Mm.
(Dish clatters, candy rattles)
(Crying)
Zack?
Zack, what's wrong?
Oh, Zack.
We don't need a pizza oven.
I am so sorry for everything I've done.
I've never meant to use God's gift of postcoital conversation as a weapon.
Sharon.
I lost 5 pounds. (Chuckles)
(Gasps)
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
It's those blessed meals of yours.
I've been eatin' 'em, and... and I haven't even cheated, because they're so filling, and the raisin loaf is actually a satisfying dessert.
(Gasps) Well, it's what Abigail gave David to appease his anger.
It helped me realize that...
we're gonna be okay.
Who needs to sell cars when you've got these?
I mean, they taste good.
They work, and... (sniffles) they've got a message.
Proverbs 15:17...
"it's better to be invited to herbs with love"
"than to a fatted calf"
"with hatred." (Mouths words)
It means you... you don't need food when you have love.
Oh, congratulations on dropping 5 pounds, and I think it is wonderful that we are both losing weight with Jesus.
Sharon, we've got a business.
We can sell these things.
I...
I know we can.
W...
"Losin' it with Jesus"... (Exhales deeply)
(Whispers) is our future.
"Losin' it with Jesus."
(Whispers) I love it!
I love it!
- And I love you!
- I love you!
Oh!
(Chuckles) Mwah.
Ohh.
Ohh!
(Laughs)
(Sighs)
I knew I shouldn't have worn the cuff links.
(Both chuckle)
Oh.
Sorry.
I... (Chuckles)
I started to get dressed up, and then I realized, I...
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Okay.
Well, I...
look, this...
this room was very expensive, so we... might as well talk in it.
(Closes door)
I had an illuminating chat with your sister about being honest when it comes to sex, and the truth is, I've only ever been with one man, and jumping into bed with you terrifies me.
(Sighs) Oh, my God.
That came out wrong.
I'm s...
I would love to jump into bed with you.
That came out wrong, too.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
- A...
Amanda.
- I'm just...
Amanda, it's okay.
I get it.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can wait as long as you want.
Look, if all... all we do tonight is wear those comfy robes, order room service, and watch pay-per-view, that's fine with me.
You're worth the wait, and waiting actually sounds good,
I mean, because your revelation... it kinda ups the stakes for me to be extremely satisfying and worth it, so... it's all right.
Thank you.
Ohh. (Pants)
But I'm done waiting.
Well, that was easy.
Shut up.
You boys look tired.
How 'bout a nap?
Anybody else wanna go?
Texas!
Save us!
We can't punch good!
Oh, you're so unbelievably awesome.
I just wish I noticed sooner.
Oooh-wa-ka-ka-ka!
Abraham Kane.
Well, if it isn't Texas.
The greatest martial artist in all of motorcity.
Behold.
I have a gun that shoots a snake.
Okay, and you're just in time to feel my Texas twister!
No!
Not that!
How'd you like to meet my friend?
His name is...
Ooooh-yah!
Curse your awesomeness, Texas!
And he says, "curse your awesomeness, Texas!"
And I kick him out the window.
It's easy!
Solid plan.
Uh, let's just put that in the back pocket for now.
Come on, Mike.
You always say that.
Your pockets must be getting pretty full with all my plans in 'em.
Sometimes you gotta Texas-ify!
Just look at this Texas twister kick.
My tomatoes!
What the heck are you doing?
It took me six months to grow those!
And it only took Texas six seconds to destroy them.
Yeah, Texas!
So what's wrong with my plan?
I told you.
This isn't the time to storm the gates with sweet Muay Thai kicks.
We're on a stakeout.
A stakeout!
Awesome!
I'll have mine rare!
Then I'll have plenty of strength to storm the gates with sweet Muay Thai kicks!
You're not listening to a word he's saying, are you?
We're waiting for a waste-disposal bot to show up.
A whatta-what-what-what?
Toxo tanks?
We've been tracking them?
They come down to motorcity to dump Kane's toxic waste.
Not today they won't.
We're gonna show Kane he can't just dump his trash on us anymore.
How close is it?
Five blocks coming up seven mile road.
Hooo-ha!
Who are those guys?
They seem insane.
No, they seem awesome.
Uh, you guys seeing what I'm seeing?
What is this place?
My sergeant says you tried to take out the Toxo tank.
You must hate that pony-tailed maniac as much as we do.
My name's Kaia.
I'm the boss in these parts.
Mike Chilton.
Kane hater and leader of the burners.
Any enemy of Kane is a friend of mine.
Kaia, Texas.
Other leader of the burners.
I got just two questions:
What's with those masks and how soon could I get one?
It's a long story, kids.
Our community has always lived off the earth.
Folks started calling us the Terra Dwellers.
But one day our little Paradise got trampled by Kane's monsters.
The toxic waste kept coming.
It mutated everything.
Kane's chemicals the very DNA of everything living down here.
Breathe easy, son.
It would take years to turn you into a mutant, dear.
Whew.
That's awful, Kaia.
Well, there's one benefit.
We use these crazy mutant plants to fight back.
These bows are filled with super spores that grow down here.
As soon as this stuff breaks open...
The spores grow into plants and the plants take over.
Nice.
I don't get it, Kaia.
Why haven't you used your super-bad mutant weapons all over Kane's ugly face?
Actually, that's sort of what we've been planning.
What're you doing with these old Toxo tanks?
I thought you were supposed to be the smart one.
We're gonna fill these things up with super spores.
Can take out Kane's waste facility then he can't dope his chemicals on anybody ever again.
Okay dokey, Kaia.
I like your ideas, but I do have some thoughts.
Hang on, Tex.
Let's just...
I mean, you can't just tie these tankers up with rope, you gotta weld it.
Dutch can do that.
And Julie's good with infiltrating.
Mike can take credit for everything, and Chuck, oh,
I don't know what Chuck does, but he can, like, scream or something.
And we can pull these Toxo things up to deluxe with our cars so you don't need that freaky deer thing.
Uh, Texas... and most importantly, you gotta make this plan bigger!
You gotta Texas-ify it!
Texas-ify it?
Texas-ify it.
Three Toxo tanks?
Times it by a thousand and better weapons!
Texas...
Texas twister!
Texas!
Take it easy, man.
Back pocket, remember?
I think your friend's got the right idea, Mike.
This is just the opportunity we were looking for.
We'll team up to shut down Kane's waste processing plant, and get to Texas-ify-ing!
Let the Texas-ifi-cation begin!
Sure is handy having someone who knows Kane's machines.
You tear up as many as we have, you get to know 'em pretty well.
How well do you know the train up there?
It'd be nice if we can get up to the waste processing facility without being shredded by his bots.
There's a blind spot near the Hamtrannik tunnel.
Kane's bots don't patrol it that often.
You'll have about a ten-minute window.
Yes, that will give us plenty of time.
There.
This rig oughta be enough.
Even for a whole fleet of Toxo tanks.
So how are we getting the others?
Hail, Texas!
Slayer of Toxo tanks!
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna talk to Kaia about the plans.
Kaia?
Kaia.
You home?
Careful with that.
This is way more dangerous than the old stuff.
Kaia's made some changes to the plan.
So, how much more are we gonna need?
A lot more.
And fast.
Hello?
- Uh... just a second.
- You need something?
Uh, just looking for Kaia.
Is she around?
She's out somewhere.
Tell her I stopped by.
'Sup, bro.
Hey, you don't look so good.
Something's up in this town, chuckles.
What happened?
I'm not exactly sure.
Doesn't feel right, though.
Feels pretty right to me.
Doo!
Bloo-bloo!
Oooh, wa-ka-ka!
Yeah, that's good, huh?
Boo-Boo!
Just put your eyes on and see if you pick up on anything weird.
You mean, like, the creepy gas masks or the giant, mutant plants f=growing everywhere?
Mmm, weirder than that.
These people are hiding something.
Hey, guys?
I think I found something.
Good evening, Mike.
Uh, Kaia.
Hey!
Just, you know... heading to bed.
That's too bad.
We could really use your help with something.
Oh, in the middle of the night?
All right, then.
So what are we looking for again?
Anything out of the ordinary.
Say, some guys washing out a chemical drum in the middle of the night.
Is it just me, or do those guys not want us to know something?
And Chuck's gonna go find out what that something is.
I am?
Ugh.
I am.
So, where we going again?
To find a special moss that grows up here.
It's an essential part of our weapons.
No-cholorum.
Hey!
Come on.
Gimmie a break.
First time mushroom climber here.
Oooh, yeah!
Well, don't everybody grab me at once.
Look at this sample, Jacob.
You ever seen anything like that?
Looks pretty alien to me, kids.
It's different than the other vines.
It's...
I don't know.
Weird.
You know, you guys need to stop bad-mouthing our hosts.
Maybe they think you're weird.
Everybody pack up.
We're getting out of here.
Whoa, whoa-di-whoa-dio, bro.
What are you talking about?
I can't say for certain, but I'm pretty sure those terrorists just tried to take me out.
- What?
- What?
Yeah, what?
Seriously, I didn't hear you.
You cut out.
We were running through the mushrooms, and I know it sounds weird, but I wasn't supposed to make it back.
They're up to something.
And if they think we're gonna help them, then they thought wrong.
Now hold it.
Don't you think you're overreacting here?
They led me onto a weak branch and none of them grabbed my hand.
It sounds to me like you fell.
You weren't there, Tex.
Now pack up.
No.
Can.
Do.
These people need us.
And unlike some other people, they appreciate my skills.
This has nothing to do with your skills.
Yeah.
Yeah, it does.
You're always hating on my ideas, man.
I'm in a place where I can finally shine, and it's eating you up inside.
Well, I'm not gonna let you ruin my moment, Mike.
If you won't do this, I'll do it myself.
Wow.
You want me to go get him?
Holy cow!
Look at this!
This leg is trying to shake my hand!
Hey there, little guy.
Get it off!
Get it off!
Incinerator!
Now!
What is that stuff?
The sample tried to eat me!
Oh, man!
If that stuff gets released in deluxe, everyone up there will be wiped out!
Is everyone okay?
I thought I heard a lady screaming.
Oh.
Well, hello, Mike.
I...
I'm glad to see you're okay.
I'll bet you are.
Our little partnership is over, Kaia.
Oh?
Why is that?
We've seen what your new spores can do.
We know what you're planning.
Yeah!
And I don't scream like a lady!
That was a shame.
I thought you'd be on my side.
After all, we're fighting the same enemy.
Yeah, but we're not fighting the same fight.
I hate Kane as much as anybody, but I've got no beef with the people of deluxe.
We can't let you hurt them.
I'm sorry to hear that, Mike.
But I've worked too long and too hard for you to stop me now.
Goodbye.
Death by plants?
Not the way I wanna go.
Come on, come on, come on!
Step aside, kids.
This is a gardener's job.
Jacob!
If you're going to fight giant, mutant plants, you might need some home grown herbicide.
Oh, let 'em stay inside with their feet propped up.
Who needs 'em anyway?
I can do all this my dang self.
Roll out, boys!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Dogies!
Jacob, how much of that stuff do you have?
How much do you need?
How much do you have?
How much do you need?
How much do you have?
Gah!
Just tell me how much you need!
Okay, here we are.
The waste processing place should be right up top.
Just think, in a few minutes we'll have brought down a tyrant.
And we have you to thank, Texas.
We could never have done all this by ourselves.
I know.
You do.
I'm just sorry my friends bailed on you.
Don't be.
Not everyone has the stomach for this.
Kaia's gonna be heading for the hamtrammik tunnel.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
What's that stuff?
Salt.
Plants hate it.
As long as we stay in this circle, we're safe.
I thought we were just taking out that waste-processing thingamabob.
Oh, trust me.
It'll get taken out too.
Help us!
Hang on!
Those are innocent people in there.
This ain't what I signed up for, Kaia.
Of course it is.
You're the one who came up with it.
You've got to Texas-ify everything.
Without you, it would've taken us years to put together a strike like this.
But this ain't Texas-ify-ing.
This is evil!
And Texas don't have no truck with evil!
Yeah, ha!
In your face, plants!
I wouldn't say that just yet.
Uh-oh.
No!
We're out of weed killer!
So long, burners.
Eat gun-Chuck, plants!
Texas!
Leave my friends alone!
Texas, you made it!
And you got nasty plant gunk all over you.
Good to see you too, ladies.
Get the civilians to safety.
Texas, you're with me, buddy.
You betrayed us.
Now we'll bury you up here with the rest of these swine.
Take a good look, Mike.
This is what Kane did to us.
Why shouldn't we do the same to his city?
These people didn't have anything to do with that.
Doesn't that matter to you?
This might be a bad time to say this, but you were right, Mike.
I was wrong about one thing, Tex.
Sometimes, you do have to Texas-ify it.
No, I'm done Texas-ify-ing.
My dumb idea is what got us into this.
Hey, I do not put dumb ideas in my back pocket.
I've got one back there that would come in pretty handy right now.
You're thinking of the Texas twister?
Let her rip, buddy.
- Help us!
- Help us!
Trying, sir.
Just having some difficulties!
We need more herbicide.
Or something to keep these vines away.
Hey, I know what does that.
He's attempting the Texas twister like it's never been done before, folks.
In a car, in the red, with a tanker full of salt!
There!
Toward that!
He's Texas-ify-ing the Texas-ifica-tion!
Thank you so much.
Texas, you did it!
I know.
I'm awesome.
Where's that crazy forrest lady?
She is gonna hear it from me.
The terrorists.
They're gone!
Man!
We didn't even get payback!
People like Kaia don't just disappear.
We'll catch up to her someday.
Why wait?
Let's go after them now!
Hold on!
Texas has an idea.
Here we go.
Okay, first, we get Dutch to build me a robot dinosaur from scratch.
What?
Uh, Texas... and then I eat all the terrorists with my new move, the Texas-asaurus Rex.
With super-sized gun Chucks.
Texas... oh, and the dinosaur has to spit fire.
Dutch can do that.
Oh, boy.
Burners!
Chirp.
Syphilis is killing you, that is extremely serious and highly infectious,
I have to fight this...
Open a ward.
I'll write a compelling letter to the Zemstvo.
This is the dispensary.
This is the key.
Don't lose it.
I'm sure if we'll do this again it will be better.
We're out of cigarettes and I need to read a newspaper.
Oh yes, we do have a lot of fun here.
Only last month I heard a very amusing anecdote.
I have to operate, I have to cut open her throat and insert a metal tube.
I don't think I can do this.
Hours and hours of staring at the snow, only interrupted by bora.
I am a murderer.
Morphine withdrawal is an unpleasant business.
Nausea, insomnia...
severe allucinations...
You don't want to do that.
I am a doctor, I can handle it.
It will never be this good again.
A Young Doctor's Notebook Episode 1x4
MOSCOW, 1934
"This is the end"
Get a doctor.
Oh!
What do they want?
You.
You're famous now, doctor!
Because of little Lidka and her metal throat.
Only eleven hours to go.
All right.
Right, who's first?
Gargle.
Drops.
Pea.
Next!
You have malaria, intermittent fever.
See the nurse and ask for quinine powder.
Ten sachets.
Next!
Drops.
Gargle.
Drops.
Syphilis.
You all... have...
Syphilis.
He just got cold, that's all.
No, you need treatment.
Extensive treatment.
Here at the hospital, starting now.
But I have too much to do at home!
Can you give me something?
I can give you a spade... to dig three little holes.
I'm opening a new syphilis clinic.
- Where?
- Here, in Mur'ev.
But we don't have the room... or the equipment... or the medicines.., or the nurses, or the beds!
Details.
I will write a letter to the Zemstvo.
Is this going to take much longer?
I mean...
should I go and come by?
I can see the crown.
All right, let's hurry thing along, shall we?
- Was it...
Was it supposed to look like that?
- No... but then you're not supposed to put forceps in the baby's eye.
Oh, yes.
Um...
Tell you what?
You take this to the ward, and I will finish up in here.
We've had quite enough excitement for one day.
- Not now, feldsher.
- But he took the quinine powder...
- that you prescribed.
- And?
All ten sachets of it.
I'll get the stomach pump.
He thought he'd heal faster, you see?
If he took all the medicine at once.
It's harshly rather ironic, because...
Sun over the yardarm.
What sun?
Don't tell me you still got the stomach pain?
Strange.
Same time as last night.
You know, I don't think the morphine is working.
Have you tried drops?
I've had a long day.
A hundred and eleven patients... fifty cigarettes.
I just want to go back in my room... and unwind.
Have you tried reading a book?
You know, Leopold Leopoldovic left an extensive library.
There's turkish erotica.
Good morning.
Oh...
Oh. not again...
Doctor, are you there?
Yes.
- Um...
Give...
Give me a minute.
- It's me, the feldsher.
I'm a miserable wretch.
Oh, God...
I'm pathetic... and weak.
I'm a disgrace to the...
Imperial Moscow University of Medicine and Dentistry.
I disgust myself.
I deserve... to rot in a forgotten hell like this.
Here's the self-pity.
And the incontinence.
- Doctor!
Doctor!
- Yes.
Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Yes, I'm coming.
Doctor!
Doctor, go back to bed, you're not needed.
- What?
- None of us are, because of the blizzard.
It's official: the hospital is closed.
So you woke me up to tell me I could go back to bed?
You could have just not come.
You're right in there?
Would you like to call a doctor?
Unfortunately, the hospital is closed.
If just I had an atlas to read!
- So what do we fancy doing today?
- We?
Why God does just...
Um...
I don't...
You know, I just...
I thought I might just have a bath.
Bath in home?
Message understood.
Ok, you'll got it.
Really... gentlemen!
I'll never thanks you enough, I had no idea it was so big.
It's stuck, you know.
No, you go down, I'll go up.
Couldn't we... couldn't we sit and put it on his side, and...
- This is a riddle.
- Just shove it!
Look at the state of this room.
What's that smell?
Smell?
I can't... smell anything.
What do you mean?
What... smell?
No, no, no.
You haven't... left the lid off the jar of pickled sprats, have you?
Oh, yes, I have, I have!
Thank you.
- Give me those sheets. will you, doctor?
- No, no. don't worry, I know where the mangle is.
That... that is not mine.
Leopold Leopoldovic left that here.
- Watch out!
- No, no.
- That is not going to fit.
- No, no, she's right.
It was foolish of me, I don't need to have a bath.
No, no.
A bath was requested, a bath you shall have.
That's not sprats.
Certainly is a big bath.
It's big enough for two men.
Actually, doctor... you wouldn't mind if I... went back to my room and left you to it?
What?
No, no, no, not at all.
Please, go, thank God, thank...
thank you.
That's it.
I'm done.
I'm gonna make a clean start.
Yes, I'll write that letter to the Zemstvo, today.
- Or, you don't think I can do it?
- No...
- I don't.
- Well, I can.
Now pass me the loofah.
Thank you.
Doctor!
Doctor!
A letter for you, doctor.
From the house of the agronomist, no less.
Maybe it's an invitation to the wedding.
It's the social event of the year... and this, in the year with the double hanging!
- Yes, but what does the letter say?
- In good time, doctor.
Now, this is the funny anecdote I've been promising to tell you.
- Oh, what a timing!
- Palchikov, the clerk,
- and the tale of the dazzling trousers.
- I'm thrilled!
But give me the letter.
Hell no, you're naked.
Where was I?
Oh yeah...
Palchikov, the clerk.
- He fell in love...
- Really?
- a humble clerk!
And she, the beautiful daughter of the agronomist.
Such a union was impossible.
- Or wasn't?
No.
- No.
No.
Because, he hatched a plan.
He went into town..
and purchased a most unusual item.
- Was it a dazzling pair of trousers?
- An item of clothing.
- A most dazzling pair of trousers.
- ...dazzling pair of trousers.
So dazzling, in fact... that she agreed to become his bride.
- Very dazzling.
- I will do so, this weekend.
It's a fairy tale.
Oh dear, she fractured her skull.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This isn't good.
"I cannot cope,"
"I beg you honestly to come soon."
- Me?
Who sent this?
- Um... doctor...
Um....
I can't read his name.
Oh!
He thinks he can see her... brain.
Well, I mean she shall be death before I get there, won't she?
And you said he was in Grachevka?
And there's a blizzard.
"I appreciate that Grachevka is a great distance to travel, especially in a blizzard..."
But I've just got in the bath!
Um...
No, it doesn't say anything about a bath.
I'm gonna get a pneumonia!
Does look cold, in there.
Morphine and hydrochloric acid.
It is definitely... habit-forming.
But...
A little... habit, it's not the same as a morphine addiction.
Is it?
Then you want to see electric lamps?
They're supposed to brighten up now.
We can't really see them tonight.
They haven't got a generator yet.
Anything else to see in Grachevka?
I was told they have a whore, now.
Oh, that's nice.
Actually, I think will be long to the agronomist's house.
Hello?
Oh, you're here for the wedding.
- I'm sorry, there's been a terrible accident.
- I hope so, I came all the way from Mur'ev.
Oh, you're the doctor?
- Yes.
- Sorry, I had no idea, you're so...
- So pleases to hear that.
- Just tell me what happened.
- Right.
- Well.
I'll start from the beginning...
- I already know about the trousers.
Of course!
Yes, um...
- It's a cranium...
- Cranium...?
It's a really big hole in the head.
And several cracks... everywhere.
I put a bandage on it, but... um...
I've really just graduated.
High school's thirteen fives.
Stop saying that.
It means nothing, out of there.
And I got fifteen.
Gosh.
You don't mind if I take notes, do you?
It's actually quite exciting, this will be my first operation.
Do you have morphine?
Yes, yes, I do...
It's right there, in my bag.
It's brand new.
The bag.
Morphine.
How many units you're going to give her?
All of it.
All of it.
Gosh, that's a lot, isn't it?
But then I suppose you want her to be asleep for the into cranium...
What are we going to use to take out shreds?
Well I don't mean the bone fragments.
I mean the gate parts.
Should I sterilize the...
A second one.
I see.
That is a lot of morphine.
Then I suppose that... we're actually not going to do the operation, don't we?
Gosh...
Can't we do anything for her?
I suppose not.
- Is she...
- Not yet.
She is... now.
- Oh God, I feel...
- Releaved, - ...sick.
There is ham, by there?
I missed dinner.
So much blood...
There's blood everywhere.
I don't think he's worried about his trousers, I think is rather about his dead wife.
She's dead?
I'm a murderer!
I'm a murderer!
Can we do anything for this poor soul?
Would morphine help?
- I'm a murderer.
- I don't know.
Not as much as...
Just a little bit... you know...
half unit.
Well you have the morphine.
I'm a murderer.
You do it.
It will make you...
She died, the whore.
Last week, syphilis.
Excellent.
Thank you for your help.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
What is it?
What do we stop for?
Have we lost the road?
Road?
What road?
We've gone across fields for hours!
Now we lost fields!
Wait here.
I thought you wanted to see Grachevka.
I thought you wanted to have an intelligent conversation.
With this little notebook?
Who's gonna want to read this juvenile memoirs?
You were like that once.
But now look at you.
About to die in the snow for a shot of morphine.
You do know it'll get worse than this, don't you?
You think this is bad?
This is nothing!
Wait until you find yourself...
at a Goldieva farmacy, lying... in another man shit, picking the inside of the dirt.
- I knew you couldn't handle this.
- Shut up, shut up!
The key is not there, you threw it away!
- What are you doing?
- It's here, somewhere!
What do you mean, "here"?
Don't know even where "here" is!
Where did you last see it?
Russia?
You're not going to find it!
Here's, you see, the... bliss in the soft grass.
And what about me?
I've lost everything!
My livelihood, my dignity, my friends...
You know who my friends are now?
Pelageya!
Demyan, Leopold... because they're all dead!
Because I can write them a prescription for morphine that they will never need!
Shut up!
I said shut up!
Go ahead!
Do it!
You have as good as killed me already.
Cigarettes!
God!
What...?
PROMISING YOUNG DOCTOR FOUND DEAD IN SNOW
Morphine withdrawal is an unpleasant business.
I am a doctor, I can handle it.
Help me, doctor, I have a strangulated hernia.
Young man...
I have vested experience of strangulated hernias.
Ask me anything.
Leopold Leopoldovic!
There is one thing I would like to ask you.
Why don't you just fuck off?
It will take you... to a lush meadow with the high summer where you lie in the soft grass, and bask in the sun.
And feel nothing but bliss.
And you will never want to return to this frozen pisshole in the snow.
I brought you a piece of ham...
- fat.
- Thank you.
- It's better?
- It is worse.
Doctor, let's finish this in the morning.
Esteemed colleagues of the Zemstvo, as you know, i run a small hospital in Mur'ev.
During my short time in this post, I have become aware of a serious problem in the region:
syphilis.
And it is my intention to fight this scourge... and set up the "Leopold Leopoldovic" Syphilis Clinic.
I have the staff in situ to realize this dream, but I lack equipment.
Attached is a list with the most pressing...
This programme contains some strong language
January 14th, 1978.
The last Sex Pistols gig.
-No fun.
This is no fun.
Beset by internal problems, the Sex Pistols broke up.
For many, the end of punk.
The universe they created around this mythological Johnny Rotten creature, is an impossibility.
No-one can be that... obtusely, permanently, insanely wonderful, could they?
'Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?
Good night.'
As Britain teetered on the brink of seismic political upheaval, the spotlight would shift to a new cast of punk-inspired idealists.
I suppose the punks were like the early revolutionaries in Russia, they did the job of breaking everything down, and then in came the next lot, and kind of, expanded it, really, musically.
What happened after punk was very much a result of what punk did.
And it didn't sound like punk rock.
Anything was possible, so long as you didn't have a great desire to become rich and famous.
It's like after the Cold War, it's like the beatnik scene in San Francisco - you suddenly felt you could do anything you wanted to do.
They would take up the challenge left by the Pistols, and re-imagine Britain and its rock 'n' roll post-punk.
If the Sex Pistols had been punk's avant-garde, in their wake emerged a second wave who took the spirit of punk and made it base.
By 1978, punk was becoming a parody of yobbish manners and three-chord thrash.
It had got quite ugly and tawdry and dark and desperate.
How many fucking tunes can go...
You know what I mean?
How many times, yeah?
I mean, the truth is that a lot of hardcore punks actually ended up begging outside Tube stations with a dog on a piece of string.
You know, it was such a nihilistic, self-destructive thing in a lot of ways.
I mean, Sid Vicious, kind of, committed suicide and took his girlfriend with him for our entertainment, you know?
And it was, kind of, getting very, very negative and self-destructive.
Punk may have painted itself into a corner, but its spirit would inspire a new generation of underground musicians across the country.
These post-punks would throw the musical rulebook out of the window, hell-bent on questioning the nature of society, capitalism and rock 'n' roll itself.
The post-punk era would be kicked off by one of punk's founding fathers.
After leaving The Buzzcocks,
Howard Devoto would look to the future and start again.
I stuck up a sign in the Virgin record shop in Manchester looking for other band members.
It certainly said something about playing fast and slow music, because, of course, punk had been a very disciplined thing where people kind of only did music in one general direction.
There was an advert up saying Howard Devoto is looking for musicians and I remember at the time thinking,
"Wow, maybe I should apply for that".
Formed in the white heat of punk in '77,
Manchester-based Magazine set out to deconstruct the rules of punk rock.
Magazine was more developed, more clever musically than most of punk.
The songs were tightly arranged.
They were well edited.
That was something from punk.
# Time flies
# Time pours
# Like an insect
# Up and down the walls
# The light pours out of me. #
We were offered Top Of The Pops and I turned it down.
And that was the first time I saw Virgin Records, our record company, go, "Argh!"
One of the year's most talked-about new bands is this one - they're called Magazine and here's their debut single, Shot By Both Sides.
Despite Devoto's misgivings,
Magazine became the first post-punk band on Top Of The Pops.
Punk finished, really, with the Pistols when they split up in January 1978, and a week or two later, Shot By Both Sides came out.
# This and that They must be the same
# What is legal is just what's real
# What I'm given to understand
# Is exactly what I steal. #
I'm afraid Top Of The Pops was a little bit of an anathema, you know?
# I was shocked to find what was allowed
# I didn't lose myself in the crowd. #
You know, most people mimed - it was fakery, and I had my problems with things like that.
# Shot by both sides. #
Magazine were first to market, but their commercial success caught them off guard.
Well, you know, the record was popular, so, I guess there's a thing that happens where it charts, and you go on Top Of The Pops, and given your performance, it goes up the charts.
I think our record was the first for a long time that actually went down.
I never really thought about commercial success.
# They'll have to rewrite all the books again
# As a matter of course
# I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd. #
And yet there was some unformed ambition.
Well, we weren't really about entertainment.
We were about this thing of expression and getting out our stuff, and that's what everybody seemed to be doing within this unit and under this umbrella.
Post-punk was characterised by refuseniks and malcontents who shunned the bright lights of the big time.
One of its most fitting bastions was Manchester, a city traditionally suspicious of metropolitan glamour.
# Entrances uncovered
# The street signs you never saw... #
It was nice, actually.
I used to like Manchester, cos you couldn't see a thing.
I mean, it was like...
With the smog and everything, you couldn't see anything.
# Street signs you never saw
# All entrances delivered... #
It was like gangster films about New York, you know.
You see...
Film noir, sort of thing, you know?
# Entrances uncovered... #
People would literally come out of the fog at you.
So it was all very mysterious.
# You got Manny in the library
# Working off his hangover 3.30 Get the spleen... #
Once they got all the pollution laws passed, you saw Manchester, it was like, "What a horrible place!"
Manchester saw a flowering of truculent bands.
But not a scene.
The subconscious effect that Manchester had on you and your personality, your thoughts, your actions, it came through in the music.
It was a pretty grim place.
And you felt
- I don't know - dark, I suppose.
Joy Division had originally formed as a punk bank in 1976, after witnessing the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall.
Once I saw Johnny Rotten, I realised that the only thing
I wanted to do in the world was tell everyone to fuck off.
It was literally the next day I went out and bought a bass guitar,
Bernard had a guitar and we started our punk band.
As our playing capabilities got better, we started writing better and better songs and that happened quite quickly.
# To the centre of the city
# Where our roads meet Waiting for you. #
Literally within the space of six months, we'd turned from Warsaw, a dodgy punk band, to Joy Division.
# Booming through the silence Without motion waiting for you
# In a room with no window In the corner, I found truth. #
In a time of three-chord thrash,
Joy Division interpreted punk's DIY ethos as permission to be different.
Determined only to be truthful, they combined a brooding sound with the existential lyrics of Ian Curtis.
Joy Division.
They took the anger of punk, the rage of punk, but that was all externalised stuff.
What was interesting about Joy Division was the rage was internalised.
# In the shadow play acting out your own
# But knowing no more
# As the assassins all grouped in four lines
# Dancing on the floor
# And with cold steel odour on their bodies. #
In 1978, post-punk was no communal scene of kindred spirits.
Rather the opposite.
Then you kind of had a slight frostiness with everybody.
You know, I can remember - empty landscape, bump into somebody from another band,
"Are you all right?" "Yeah.
Are you all right?" "Yeah".
That was it.
Bands are very competitive, and there's always a great rivalry, and there was always a great rivalry between us and The Fall.
I've never paid much attention to our competition or anything like that, other groups.
I'm a big Fall fan, believe it or not.
HE LAUGHS
Like Joy Division, Mark E Smith had witnessed the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in 1976, and set out on his own path with The Fall.
- # Totally wired
- Totally wired
# Totally biased... #
The Pistols, when they started out,
I think they were quite garage, really.
But in the space of a couple of singles, it went almost heavy metal, didn't it?
# When the going gets weird
# The weird turn pro
# So I'm totally wired
# T-t-t-totally wired
- # I'm totally wired
- Can't you see?
# T-t-t-totally wired now. #
Taking the band's name from a novel by Camus, there was no mistaking Mark E Smith's existential street poetry for the initial agitprop of punk.
The more you didn't dress like them, the more you got spat at.
# My heart and I agree... #
We would get attacked for having long hair and all sorts.
You got attacked for having long hair?
Yeah, cos, you know, if they saw you and you forgot to cut your hair, you know what I mean...
Used to come off stage all green.
Back in metropolitan London, the big question on every interviewer's lips in 1978 was, what was Johnny going to do next?
The Pistols broke up in a really unclarified and corrupting way, due to mismanagement, really, more than anything.
and it left me completely frustrated and I wanted to do something, cos I wanted to continue with music, so I, kind of, pooled the friends I had around me, and formed PiL.
The record company, Virgin, weren't too interested in a new band.
They were really, kind of, very angry with me for daring to suggest complete unknowns to them, but I had to remind them that, you know, up until two years before that, I was a complete unknown.
John was up to do something radical.
I was known for playing a little bit of bass,
I'm not quite sure how people knew that, but I love bass -
I was synonymous with playing bass, I was at one with playing bass.
There's only other thing, which was clay pigeon shooting, which I took up once and was very, very good at from the word go, and got afraid because it might displace playing bass.
I love cacophony, I mean, I loved the Captain Beefheart approach to music.
You know, fill a room full of amateurs and let's see what happens.
Fantastic.
Who could have known that there would be no more Sex Pistols?
Next thing I knew, John's saying, "Let's do it,"
and I knew Wobble, and they said, "We want to use Wobble,"
and I said, "Great," and it was on.
Released on October 13th, 1978,
Public Image marked the moment Johnny Rotten stepped out of costume to reveal John, the visionary.
# You never listened to a word that I said
# You only see me for the clothes that I wear
# Or did the interest go so much deeper
# It must have been the colour of my hair
# The public image. #
You know, everybody was waiting for Rotten's new record, after leaving the Pistols, what was it going to be like?
When he came back with the single Public Image Ltd, it was just like...
# What you wanted was never made clear
# Behind the image was ignorance and fear. #
Levene's... smacked-out, Byrds, arpeggio guitar...
# Public image... #
But more than that, right, it was rock music, but it wasn't rock music like the Pistols or The Clash, it wasn't traditional like that, it was like a departure.
It was like a way into the future.
# I'm not the same as when I began
# I will not be treated as property
# Public image. #
Public Image Ltd, very warm welcome to Check It Out.
Where did you get the name Public Image Ltd from?
Most people who would interview me had a negative attitude towards me and so it was...
Again, it was another battle I had to take on in order to get my point across.
I don't have to explain myself to anybody, and I ain't going to bother.
Now, I was asked here, right, to interview with the band here, PiL, but now we're facing a cheapskate, comedy interrogation act and it just ain't on, pal.
It was relentlessly tedious to be presumed to be a thick, ignorant oik, over and over again.
Well, it sounds like we've heard this story before.
Really, would you like to tell me where?
Good night.
-Good night.
They didn't want an explanation of the songs.
They didn't want to know that this was an ongoing force and something to be reckoned with and all coming from a really nice person!
Cop out.
-Cop out.
-BEEP.
Well, I'm pleased I didn't pick the short straw for THAT interview.
If post-punk was characterised by darkness and paranoia,
Britain in '78 was the perfect backdrop.
As the fag-end of Callaghan's socialist Government played out, the trade unions went into overdrive, creating a "Winter of Discontent".
Well, I think capitalism was collapsing rather than fading, and then was going to be shored up when Thatcher got in.
You know, the climate at the time was pretty desperate.
People were on three-day weeks, no rubbish collections.
# How many dead or alive?
#
England was a very, very miserable, burnt-out oil rig, basically.
# How many dead or alive?
#
There was an American photographer came over, and we did a promo shoot with him in Leicester Square, when Leicester Square was, I don't know, eight bin bags deep.
It was just like walls of bin bags, it was like a rainy, grey day in London, with starling shit all over these black bin bags.
I think it stinks, like all the other damn strikes in this country, run by the filthy, socialist, communist unions.
It is not an exaggeration to say the country was on the verge of civil war.
In fact, the most paranoid voices at that time believed that the Government was planning to bring in martial law.
There was a certainly a cabal within the army and the establishment to do that.
I think there was an armed wing of the Tory Party that were trying to organise a coup at the time of the Labour Government.
There's a book called A Very British Coup, and there's a film about it.
As Lady Di said, there's dark forces at heart in British politics.
One of my favourite films from that era is called Radio On, by Chris Petit.
It's filmed in black and white.
It could be, like, the '50s almost.
Everything seemed very grey and very pessimistic.
What was great about that film, of course, was the soundtrack was Radioactivity by Kraftwerk which really threw the whole thing into a completely different, weird spin.
One of the key ingredients of post-punk would be the fearless assimilation of a kaleidoscope of musical styles.
Punk had championed DIY, and post-punk made it the sound of the future.
# Radioactivity... #
Well, I think punks hated synthesisers generally, from a, kind of, ideological point of view, because if you looked at the uses of synthesisers in those days, it was in prog rock bands to play very fast, pseudo-classical riffs.
You know, to me, the synthesiser felt like a punk instrument, because it was much easier to play than a guitar, and you just had to twiddle a few knobs, play one note.
You get a half-decent sound and a half-decent idea and you had a song.
Now, if you listen to people like Human League, or anybody who were completely disillusioned with the music of the time, felt the synthesiser was a logical place to go next.
The Human League were so far removed in look and sound, that even the king of punk himself had trouble spotting kindred spirits.
# Faced with the choice
# What would you say
# The path of least resistance
# It seems the only way. #
When Being Boiled came out, John Lydon was doing the reviews at NME, which at that time was like the emperor going... yeah?
And he's gone into all these reviews and said, "Oh, it's bloody rubbish,"
and it comes round to Being Boiled, and he just said, "Bloody hippies".
Two words.
I'm going, "Are you sure, John?"
Because essentially, this is the difference between the London scene, as it is a was at the time, to them, they were still in this thing like,
"If I have a quiff, I'm cool".
After that... ..initial classic British punk rock phase things went all over the place, and things weren't homogeneous - very far from it.
In 1979, the future of music was up for grabs amongst the factions of post-punk.
# Ah
# A-a-a-ow
# Ah
# A-a-a-ow
The term "post-punk" is, I always thought, quite interesting, and it is literally true that what we did was after punk.
# In my arms
# We shall begin
# With none of the rocks There's no charge. #
I think there was something else going on, in a sense, that people were trying out, I suppose, proto-mash-ups.
We thought we were a mixture of a funk band and a rock band, somehow or other.
Post-punk will do, won't it?
I think I prefer it to punk funk.
I think there was that sense that anything was possible, so long as you didn't have a great desire to become rich and famous.
The dilemma between integrity and entertainment was caught perfectly in 1979, when Gang Of Four were offered a spot on Top Of The Pops to perform their expose of consumerism, At Home He's A Tourist.
We were doing rehearsals for the show, and they picked up on the word "rubbers", cos it's in the song - it's "the rubbers you hide in your top-left pocket".
They said, "You can't use the word 'rubbers'," and we said, "Why not?"
And they said, "Because this is a family show and we don't want that disgusting word used on our family show".
# And the rubbers you hide
# In your top-left pocket. #
We had a long chat about this, whether censorship was something that we were prepared to embrace.
So we changed the word "rubbers" to "packets".
"The packets you hide in your top-left pocket".
And the producer said,
"You've changed the word to packets," and we said, "Yes".
He said, "Yes, but it's still got the same meaning, hasn't it?
"So what we'd like you to do, we'd like you to re-record it with the word 'rubbish' instead".
I told him in quite short, pithy words, that I didn't think that was a very good idea, and we walked off the show.
We gained nothing by standing our ground.
Except to prove that we could be really bloody minded.
# We are the sultans
# We are the sultans of swing. #
To my eternal shame, Dire Straits, whose single, Sultans Of Swing, had been in the same place in the charts for two weeks running and was likely to go out of the charts, were invited in at the last minute,
having already re-recorded their track, to come on Top Of The Pops, and that's why their single went up the charts and became a hit.
'The much-criticised Radio 1 playlist committee.'
John Cooper Clarke.
-That's weird.
-It is a weirdy.
Cooper Clarke?
John Cooper Clarke.
It came out and then they took it back for remixing.
Boring.
- Boring.
- It doesn't mean much.
Same tempo as the last one.
Exactly the same tempo.
The conceptual nature of post-punk is no easy shoe-in for radio playlists.
Two minutes 30, fades, yes!
British radio was really not open to what we were doing.
We were not considered a radio-friendly band.
# I remark. #
We had definitely arrived by 1979 as far as the press was concerned, but we had no radio.
There was very little radio play, outside of John Peel.
# Like a heartbeat
# Like a heartbeat
# Like a heartbeat
# Like a heartbeat
# Like a heartbeat. #
Off air, there was one medium, which lent itself perfectly to the new music.
I mean, that was the time when a lot of people bought the NME, and a lot of people bought it because there were really interesting conversations going on.
I mean, you had NME and Sounds, and, latterly, the Melody Maker, that were very big supporters of us.
I mean, we got...
There was another one, as well, wasn't there?
Record Mirror?
Record Mirror.
They didn't love us so much.
There was a fascinating - or what seemed to us fascinating - debate going on about what it was all about.
To categorise post-punk as being purely outside the mainstream was not the full picture.
There were musicians who launched stellar careers on a new wave of punk-inspired pop.
# I don't want to... #
You know, there's The Fall, and there's New Wave.
# ..go to Chelsea. #
I think it was very appropriate, actually.
Elvis Costello and all that crap.
New Wave, no, no.
You daft h'apporths.
It's really getting it wrong.
It was an instant record company movement to try and turn punk into just a fad and here's the new fad.
# Message in a bottle... #
People like Sting were all part of that.
They definitely were.
# Message in a bottle... #
He's very far removed from the Buddhist he pretends to be, when there's a dollar in it.
This is Public Image Ltd, and Death Disco.
While the Police were happy to court fame, Johnny still didn't care.
On July 12th, 1979, PiL appeared live on Top Of The Pops performing a fusion of dub, disco and Tchaikovsky, with lyrics about the recent death of Lydon's mother.
# Words can never can say the way
# You told me in your eyes. #
Death Disco was on Top Of The Pops;
that is subversive because it was being beamed into millions of people's living rooms.
# Never no more hope away
# Final in a fade. #
It's actually not subversive, because I see the shit-stem as being morally bankrupt, and anyway around, out or through is actually to the benefit of mankind, so... it's inverted subversiveness.
Is there such a concept?
There probably is.
# Never really know
# 'Til it's gone away... #
I mean, who wouldn't go on Top Of The Pops, yeah?
I mean, there's no point saying, "I'm not going on Top Of The Pops, cos we're so punk and different".
It wasn't like that, it was like, "Wow, this is great".
All I cared about when we did Death Disco on Top Of The Pops, was getting to the make-up department and getting my teeth blacked out.
Death Disco featured on Second Edition, "the" post-punk album.
It was presented in a metal box, like a time capsule for a bygone era.
To me, that record sounds...
It's pure art because it sounds like Britain felt like to live in back in 1979.
It's dank record.
It's dark, it's damp and it's slightly depressed.
# Drive to the forest in a Japanese car
# The smell of rubber on country tar... #
It just feels like Britain, you know.
It's kind of like a greyness and a kind of...
Not rain but after the rain.
# ..the cassette played
# Poptones... #
I paint pictures with words and sounds.
And I want those pictures to be as accurate as possible and to tell a complete true story, and it's all part of the progression of earth, life, death, all of it.
# You left a hole in the back of my head
# I don't like hiding in this foliage and peat
# It's wet and I'm losing my body heat
# The cassette played
# Poptones. #
The Metal Box record was, I think, one of the albums that changed things for a lot of people.
You know, rather than the restricted sort of chord thrash, there was, like, soundscapes, and Wobble doing this other thing altogether, which no-one had sort of heard outside of reggae, really.
HE PLAYS THE BASS RIFF TO "POPTONES"
MUSIC: "Poptones" by PiL
Poptones musically and lyrically deconstructed all notions of rock.
The tribes of post-punk were challenging the retro orthodoxy that punk rock had become.
The interesting thing is that bands like the Pistols and The Clash were seen as so experimental and so different, but actually they were rock 'n' roll bands.
They acted and dressed like rock stars, really, and had the whole pose on stage.
Whereas I think The Slits were utterly different.
We challenged all that.
We made sure we even stood differently.
We didn't fall into all the sort of, I don't know, the cliches of rock 'n' roll.
In 1979, The Slits' fusion of punk and reggae was a soundtrack for a new Britain.
MUSIC: "Newtown" by The Slits
It's talking about the new towns appearing all over England, which were just these soulless little mini-cities.
It's quite ominous.
The bass line is quite ominous.
It's talking about people's addictions, basically, in the city.
What's that one they built?
Oh, Milton Keynes, yeah.
It just somehow caught the whole ordinariness and desolation of living in a new town.
Post-punk was a flowering of creativity and idealism that proved rock 'n' roll didn't have to be a swindle.
There was this whole idea of somehow controlling the means of production.
Again, through questioning things, we were questioning contracts, we were realising things were being corrupted and taken away and polished up and made into, like, Showaddywaddy punk, or children's TV punk, right?
So we wanted to have control over what we were doing.
Formed by Geoff Travis in 1978,
Rough Trade was an indie label with a Marxist heart that took its cue from punk.
Rough Trade was very important because they were so open to different styles.
If you get, like, the first five records they did, for instance, you'll find synthesiser music, guitar music, women, men, mixed.
You know, they were distributing reggae as well.
It just felt very, very open.
If you walked into Rough Trade, they had a catalogue of scores of artists, doing maybe two or three records, most of which wouldn't sell very much at all.
That was their business model.
It was wonderful.
Prior to Margaret Thatcher coming to power, you know, the whole idea of money and commerciality was not an issue.
It was kind of almost a bad thing, you know, the idea of seeking fame, success and money, was...
You know, we weren't about that at all.
In fact almost the opposite.
What Rough Trade was to London, Factory Records was to Manchester.
Fronted by colourful TV personality Tony Wilson,
Factory signed Joy Division.
They didn't care about making pots of money.
They focused on the presentation of new music.
Tony Wilson in particular, I loved his attitude.
When he did the first Durutti Column LP and he and Pete Saville came up with the idea of putting sandpaper on the sleeve, so that when you put it in you destroyed all your other records.
I thought that was absolute genius.
That was from the Situationist Manifesto.
The Situationists were going to bring a book out which destroyed the sleeves of all the other books.
Tony appropriated the idea and said,
"Let's put it on this album".
I thought it was great.
We got paid 50p per 100 sheets for sticking it on the LPs, which was double-bubble.
It was great.
It was somewhat diffused by people shrink wrapping it.
Just when the theory was getting interesting, reality bit.
There was a little period where there was this exciting time, things were really happening at that point, and then, of course, you have this, you know...
You can't really explain how ugly the Thatcher thing kind of was.
It was kind of like the sort of really horrible, ugly, accountant types had come in, and they were kind of going, "Fun time's over".
MUSIC: "By The Rivers Of Babylon" by Boney M
On May 4th, 1979, Margaret Thatcher took office, a Prime Minister who the post-punks instinctively hated.
To be a punk, you had to keep on changing and questioning.
We thought we were questioning the very structure of society and the very structure of the music you were playing, so we ended up wandering into this nether land.
We came out with this demented, you know, God knows what!
Avant-guard jazz meets King Tubby at the roots of hell or something!
# We are prostitutes
# Everyone has their price
# We are prostitutes
# Everyone has their price. #
The ironically-named Pop Group caught something of the rising monetary zeitgeist in October 1979, with a stinging take on consumerism.
# And you too will learn to live the lie
# And you too will learn to live the lie
# You will learn to live the lie
# Everyone has their price. #
It's not negative to think about politics and the way the world runs.
Since the 1900s, they've been trying to tell us that working people shouldn't think about how their lives are controlled, but it's good to feel a bit empowered.
# Ambition
# Consumer fascism... #
That's when Thatcher and all this stuff comes in.
So suddenly your brain's going, "Oh, my God.
I'm not what they call an adult, am I?"
Of course we weren't until we were about 48!
# We are prostitutes... #
And some of us still aren't!
We won't mention names.
Do you know what I mean?
Punk isn't standing playing four...
Punk is experimenting, in fashion, in clothes and politics.
That's what punk is, you know?
Not some old fat fart lecturing you about punk on fucking BBC Four.
In 1979, the anger and radicalism of punk hadn't just dissipated into the realms of musical aestheticism.
There were also now real anarchists involved.
# I am an Antichrist
# I am an anarchist
# Don't know what I want... #
Crass promoted anarchy as a political ideology, and advocated direct action.
# I...
- # I just wanna be
- He wants to be
# Anarchy. #
We were intervening on something which we saw as just a hedonistic wank.
And although it's a slight misrepresentation of Lydon's "no future", we, as the people we were, absolutely would not accept there was no future.
The future is ours to make.
That's what we went out to say.
The future is not ours to make by "get pissed destroy".
The future was a positive one and we were going to create a positive one.
# Fuck the politically minded Here's something I want to say
# About the state of nation The way it treats us... #
Punk, to Crass, was all about dogma rather than musical experimentation.
# Then you're a prime example of how they must not be
# This is just a sample of what they've done to you and me
# Do they owe us a living?
Of course they do, of course they do
# Owe us a living?
Of course they do... #
What I needed was to offer a substantial concept of freedom, which I think was best expressed in there is no authority but yourself, which became our major catchphrase.
NEWSREEL:
Crass and what they represent are attacked politically from all sides.
The right see them simply as criminals out to destroy the existing structures of society.
The left see them as hopeless utopians, deviationists, nearer to a bunch of vandals.
As for the authorities, they don't like anarchists in general because they're unpredictable.
You can never tell how they'll react to a given political situation.
MUSIC: "Do They Owe Us A Living" by Crass
# Do they owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
# Owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
# Owe us a living?
Course they fucking do. #
One of the worst confrontations I ever experienced, and we certainly experienced plenty, with attacks from the British Movement and all that sort of shit, but one of the most unpleasant ones was when the vegetarians and vegans
decided to have a go at each other.
That was just ludicrous.
Anarcho-punks weren't the only ones to reclaim punk.
The Oi!
Movement, led by Cockney Rejects, were the bastard offspring of Sham 69.
They wanted to take punk from the King's Road back to the East End.
They were dragging punk from the art schools back to the reality of what the mythology of punk was.
They were the reality of punk mythology.
# Gotta break out Find something else to do
# I can't stand being stuck in here with you
# Gonna have a laugh Break into a store
# You know I'm bored I don't care any more... #
Like The Angels With Dirty Faces, they came from places you don't want to go.
That's why there was not a lot written by the middle-class media about these new bands.
# I'm not so ignorant
# I'm not a fool
# So keep your intelligence
# I'm not a fool
# I'm not a fool... #
The music press had a built-in resistance to punk.
They hated punk in the first place, the normal punk.
They were much happier when New Wave happened.
New Wave was more intellectual, more middle-class, people who had been to university who were Marxists, like the Gang Of Four.
They loved bands like that because they were more up their street.
The turn of the decade was beset by all sorts of dread and tension.
But by far the most terrifying was the crescendoing Cold War.
Enormous military build-ups in both Russia and Reagan's America, underscored by the Soviet war in Afghanistan, had led to a renewed round of political brinkmanship.
There was an office on top of the shop of Rough Trade.
I was walking around in full army gear with a helmet on, because I thought World War lll was about to break out.
Honestly.
'If we are attacked by nuclear weapons, these are the warning sounds you must recognise.'
You may find some of this film disturbing, but as long as we remain a likely target for attack, we must think about the unthinkable.
UK alarm level one.
Missile attack.
Would you know what to do if you heard sirens sound?
Waste of time, innit, going anywhere.
You've had it, in't ya?
- You've had it, in't ya?
- Will you take any preparations at all?
What preparations?
You've had it, in't ya?
You've had it, in't ya?
No messing about, is it?
You've had it, in't ya?
No point crying over spilt milk, is there?
AIR-RAID SIREN WAILS
Resourceful Brits that we were, we knew that carefully-placed cushions would deliver us and our pets from mutually assured destruction.
Nuclear war was a huge threat, you know.
It was a great paranoia that I think a lot of people held, even if they weren't talking about it all the time.
There was the underlying fear of this great force out there that could be so destructive.
If post-punk was characterised by gloom, its darkest masterpiece was Young Marble Giants' Final Day, a 1 minute 40 minimalist painting of Armageddon, released on Rough Trade.
# When the rich die last
# Like the rabbits running from a lucky past
# Full of shadow cunning
# And the world lights up for the final day
# We will all be poor having had our say... #
I wrote the song for the plight of humanity.
When the rich die last, like the rabbits running from a lucky past, full of shallow cunning, I was getting my dig in there.
I quite like digging at the rich.
It's just pure jealousy!
HE LAUGHS
# Put a blanket up on the window pane
# When the baby cries lullaby again
# As the night goes out on the final day
# For the people who never had a say. #
Even now when I listen to that track, it's got a very strong energy to it, in terms of its bleakness and the fear that's in it, really, as well.
# There is so much noise There is too much heat
# And the living floor throws you off your feet
# As the final day falls into the night
# There is peace outside in the narrow light. #
Just when it seemed things couldn't get any darker, in 1980, post-punk's poster boy took his own life.
Ian Curtis's suicide both canonised and ended Joy Division.
Atmosphere was re-released as a posthumous requiem, replete with iconic video, which helped create a post-punk legend.
When Ian died, we just cut Joy Division off, cut it adrift.
The group literally was professional for about nine months.
It was such a small, short time, you know.
To look back now and think of the effect you've had, and the effect that you're having on music now, 30-odd years later, is ridiculous.
It's a great compliment to the songwriters.
He was an incredible poet, more than anything else.
Just amazing.
A one-off, a one-off.
MUSIC: "Geno" by Dexys Midnight Runners
In the new decade, there would be a noticeable change of mood.
The term "post-punk" is generally applied to a lot of bands who couldn't really play but had been at university and were applying either art theory or Marxist theory to music that was kind of amateurish but maybe feeling towards something new.
What about Dexys Midnight Runners?
What about The Specials, The Pogues?
All bands who took traditional musical forms and then brought it screaming and kicking right up-to-date, by writing about life in contemporary Britain.
MUSIC: "You're Wondering Now" by The Specials
2Tone marked the moment when post-punk went positive.
Fusing black ska with the energy of punk, 2Tone was wildly popular.
It was spearheaded by The Specials' Jerry Dammers, whose ambition was to rescue punk from the darkness.
2Tone revolutionised the pop scene.
It revolutionised everything in it, cos it had a philosophy, it had a person whose vision it was who was driving it, and it would never have happened without Jerry Dammers.
He made that happen.
2Tone was actually more popular than punk ever was.
Punk was quite an extreme thing.
It was quite a minority interest, really.
There was a lot of negative sides to it, and it was in danger of degenerating into out-and-out fascism.
That's what we felt, with the Sham Army and everything.
That's where we came in, to try and get in there and change the way people thought.
MUSIC: "Ghost Town" by The Specials
Released in 1981, Ghost Town was post-punk's God Save The Queen moment.
Not since the Pistols' searing release of four years prior, had such social comment caught the imagination of a nation.
We went and did a gig in Glasgow, and there were a lot of people on the streets selling their household items, just in the street.
It was just really strange.
Little old ladies selling their tea cups.
I'd never seen that in this country before.
That's where I really got the idea for that song.
It wasn't just about Glasgow.
It was about the whole country.
It was about Coventry as well.
Factories were closing down.
All the big industries were being closed down, you know, by Thatcher.
# This town is coming like a ghost town
# No jobs to be found in this country
# Can't go on no more
# People getting angry... #
Ghost Town reached number one in July 1981.
It marked a parting of the waves for post-punk.
After years of being wilfully uncommercial, the most radical thing left for some was to reinvigorate the charts.
'Now, straight into Human League.'
MUSIC: "The Sound Of The Crowd" by The Human League
# Don't put your hand in a party wave
# Make a shroud pulling combs through a backwash frame... #
You couldn't get any more avant-garde than the early Human League.
But by 1982, they were the biggest pop band in the world.
# Stroke a pocket with a print of a laughing sound... #
Something came along in 1982, where suddenly it was cool to be on the cover of the NME, as it always was, but even more cool if you could somehow also be on the cover of Smash Hits.
People like Martin Fry, ABC coming along, Billy Mackenzie...
Mavericks.
# I'm standing still
# And you say I dress too well... #
Post punk's reinvigoration of pop was the apex of this generation's story.
There still remained those for whom there was no success like failure, and failure was no success at all.
# Have I done something wrong?
# What's wrong?
The wrong that's always in wrong...#
It was an explosion and it was very short lived, maybe two or three years, and then it branched off into these different things.
Then the whole music scene got squeaky clean with groups like Duran Duran and Wham!
Duran Duran were like Wire with nice-looking boys and cheerful tunes.
People talk about the early '80s as being this amazing...
A whole post-punk scene.
Most people didn't even know about that stuff.
What they knew about was pop.
Pop suddenly supplanted everything.
The whole thing became unrecognisably glossy and kind of royal blue and shoulder pads.
What happened next?
The New Romantics.
It was, like, "Oh!" Tragic, really, you know?
We're the eternal underground.
We're the eternal influence.
We're the grumpy granddads who were there before you've been anywhere.
No way.
No, no.
I'm not having that in.
Perhaps the song that best summed up the post-punk era was Rip It Up And Start Again.
Edwyn Collins had borne witness to The Clash's White Riot tour in '77, before forming his own band, Orange Juice.
# Rip it up and start again
# I hope to God you're not as dumb as you make out
# I hope to God... #
I wanted to try something different, something new, jangly guitars.
# I hope to God.. #
Spencer Davis Group, Stevie Winwood and all that shit.
Raw but interesting.
It's a time for a change.
# You know the sea is very... #
The song contained a canny reference to punk originals The Buzzcocks.
Afterwards, Jimmy Savile came up to me.
And... he...
HUMS MELODY
"How you're doin', Edwyn?"
It was funny.
Most hilarious.
Stories of London.
Public Image Ltd 2012.
John Lydon is back with the first new PiL album in 20 years.
From The Sex Pistols to PiL,
Johnny Rotten to John Lydon,
King Johnny remains the ever-contrarian spirit of punk.
MUSIC: "Reggie Song" by PiL
# You see a Reginald
# He is a reasonable man
# And being comfortable
# With a bit of a better plan
# He don't see... #
Over the years there's been some 49 different members of PiL.
It's almost like a working-class university.
I suppose the one thing you learn in PiL the most is the punk ethos is do it yourself because nobody will do it for you.
# I've been dreaming... #
Don't sit back and try to learn the set formats.
# I'm still living... #
If you do that you become institutionalised and you become as tedious as everything else in the top 30.
# Back in the garden
# I'm still living... #
I love being on top of the ocean and I love being underneath it too.
I love that.
The colours down there, the life that goes on, it's fantastic.
It's both sides of the picture, the yin and the yang.
# We're all still living
# Back in the garden
# I'll be there. #
Welcome to our world.
Betty, are you ready?
It's stuck.
What about now?
Betty!
I'II get it.
Just go.
Betty?
The car is here.
What's going on?
We've got to go.
darling, I just don't think I can go tonight.
What's the matter?
It's a woman's thing.
Is there any way you could play with pain?
It's the Junior League of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.
Your mother will be there.
It'II be very endearing.
Forgive me on the way?
Thank you.
Say au revoir.
Bonjour, Marie.
Marie, I can't understand you.
-Moustiques?
-Mosquitoes.
We can't let Heinz beat us there.
He has a name, you know.
And do you know what that is?
Are you kidding me?
He's the only man I want to please more than you.
And your father.
I'm the baby.
They miss me.
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.
I'm Canadian.
although, for all we know, they are, too.
You know, back in Pittsburgh, everybody is pretty much who you expect them to be.
Or you know them forever.
Raymond and I met in high school.
well, then we've been married longer than you.
-I told you he was smooth.
-How did you two meet?
-well...
-At work.
Don was divorced.
well, that's none of my business.
You have a teenage daughter, emily.
-How's her summer?
-It's tough.
She's around the house all the time.
Too old for camp, too young for a job.
-I say let her enjoy it.
-I agree.
You don't sound so happy about it when I get home.
well, the music is so loud.
Do you know the rolling Stones, Don?
-Sure.
-The Stones.
She can't get enough of them.
The other night, she's playing this song, "Time, time is on your side..."
-Time ls On My Side.
-Yes, it is, dear.
well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking, what if they were to sing, you know,
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?
Or something like that.
I don't know.
They're gonna be in New York.
emily almost jumped in our bags with us when she heard we were coming.
Maybe you could, you know, get them to record it while they're here.
well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?
Yes.
CIara, where is Roger?
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.
-You wanted to see me?
-I was waiting in my office to give you some good news.
Drinking good news?
Mohawk called.
You're welcome.
They haven't informed their agency, but I'm told it's a matter of hours.
welcome back, suckers.
I think you should handle the account.
-So, they asked for me.
-They enjoy your company.
And since you were here when they were here, they think you know their business.
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?
So you're aware they've taken on $54 million in debt to replace their planes and there's a mechanic strike looming?
-although they'II likely be spared.
-So far, so good.
Don and I have been trying to explain to Lane this is a daily business and we'II need a dedicated copywriter.
I don't understand why Miss olson can't handle it.
Because these guys are gonna ask her to make drinks.
We're still paying Don, aren't we?
Don's not going to write local fare ads three times a week.
That's all it is?
Just get a guy with basic retail experience and run with it.
congratulations.
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper, Mr. Crane to see you.
Just a minute, Dawn.
Is Don in a meeting?
He's with Mrs. Draper.
Thank you, Dawn.
You're welcome.
It's so confusing.
people keep saying that, but we haven't had any problems.
You haven't.
But out in the office, it's really hard to tell who's who.
-hello, Harry.
-Good morning.
Backstage, Forest hills Tennis Stadium, Saturday night, put your hands together for the rolling Stones.
And how would you gauge their interest?
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.
-I'II drive.
-It starts at 8:00, but apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.
There's a dynamite italian restaurant with a first-rate veal parm.
-Nope.
-Good.
Then I will be ready at 7:30, having eaten.
Have Dawn pencil it in.
-hello, pauline.
-hello, dear.
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
Aren't you sweet to come all the way over here when a phone call would have sufficed.
Are the children home?
They're at day camp.
You know that.
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.
well, that's good to hear, I guess.
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.
-PauIine...
-And I'm sure he never shows it, but it upsets Henry when you're not there.
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.
I wasn't feeling well.
Honey, I know how it happens.
You get comfortable, and you give up a little bit, and then it just gets out of control.
There are things you can do about this.
There are pills you can take.
Why haven't you taken them?
believe me, I would if I couId.
I have a heart condition.
And honestly, at my age, I don't have to please men anymore.
But you...
Don't you want to get back into that incredible closet of yours again?
It'II be easy for you.
You're just one of those girls.
Thank you, Dawn.
-What's so funny?
-She was the most qualified.
We've got great news, but assume this is for your ample ears only.
Is it about Heinz and the rolling Stones?
-What?
-No.
Harry's such a liar.
Baked beans and the rolling Stones.
A client's idea if I ever heard one.
Mohawk airlines is returning.
That's great.
That's a big fish.
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.
well, I obviously have experience, I mean, at a Iow level, but I saw how it worked.
Your plate is full, and, frankly, Mohawk is going to insist on a regular copywriter.
-Someone with a penis.
-I'II work on that.
call in books.
You're the search committee.
-Okay, when?
-immediately.
Now, this is gonna be my account, so I don't want just some hack with retail experience.
He should be brilliant and have awards.
I want you to bring me a good-Iooking version of Don.
That'II be easy.
-Mrs.
Francis.
-hello.
So nice of you to see me so quickly.
well, slow day.
What seems to be the problem?
well, it's just that I've been wondering...
I've put on a few pounds and I haven't had much luck reducing on my own for some reason.
well, with middIe-aged women, it gets easier to put it on and harder to take it off.
well, a friend told me it'd be easier if you gave me diet pills.
Just to give me a little jump-start.
Is your friend a doctor?
No.
well, I'm not going to give you a prescription without giving you an exam.
What, for diet pills?
If you think it's necessary.
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife has a rapid weight gain, the cause is usually psychological.
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom, things that cause us to lose our seIf-controI.
But first, we have to rule out diabetes, hyperthyroidism...
I don't need to take the pills forever.
I don't like that.
What?
could you swallow?
Henry!
Mrs. Francis is on line one.
-Betts, you there?
-Don.
-I don't know what to do.
-About what?
I went to the doctor this morning and he found this thing.
It's a node or a nodule or something, and it's on my thyroid.
And they don't know what it is, but it's a lump, Don.
And he's sending me to the city to some specialist for tests.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I can't, Don.
I can't.
Betts, what exactly did he say?
Nothing.
You know how they are.
Do you want me to take the kids?
The kids.
The kids.
Oh, God.
Birdie.
Say what you always say.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
If I see one more volkswagen ad with something else in it...
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toilet paper, shitbird.
Too fat.
Too thin.
shelly Parker.
Might be a woman, God forbid.
Irony.
That's promising.
Have I lost my sense of smell, or is this good?
That's bitching.
What's this guy's name?
"michael Ginsberg."
Nice knowing you, Mike.
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.
This is why girls don't play sports.
You've been working on Heinz for four months.
Somebody else is gonna carry the ball across the goal line?
Bringing him in for Mohawk.
I hope you Iike him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.
I Iike working with talented people.
It inspires me.
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.
Are you suddenly not competitive?
The chick who races people to the toilet?
I'm going to bring him in.
Stick to mediocre.
You'II sleep better.
Can I come in?
Of course.
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 1 1 :00.
Tomorrow?
My boss made a call.
You told Mayor Lindsay?
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.
-I don't know if tomorrow...
-You want to wait on this?
-well, if it is something...
-If, if, if.
Betty, Iet's not play that game, okay?
Come to bed.
You want some brandy?
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.
You're sweet.
I'm gonna have a brandy.
Betty.
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Joyce, hello.
How are you?
Not good.
I'm here.
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.
It's Francis now.
My husband's name is Henry, too, actually.
Look, you know what?
I'm gonna be in radiology forever.
Mrs. darling, they're waiting for you, too.
Why are you here?
You want to get some lunch after?
I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.
You think you don't want to have lunch, but you do.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I'm going.
hello.
I'm Peggy olson.
michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.
No, we're meeting here.
So what's he like?
Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?
-Excuse me?
-Don.
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.
Have a seat.
So, is Don stopping by?
No, it's just me.
-Can you hire me?
-well, no, but I'm the first round.
WouIdn't you want to talk to the person who could hire you?
I spent three weeks dancing at that crappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.
-Yes, he is.
-Is Don a real person?
'Cause I'd really like to meet him.
I'm the person you need to impress right now.
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?
Okay.
-I liked your work.
-And I Iike your work.
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?
-alien Ginsberg?
-He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.
I figured we got to be related somehow.
And what's he gonna say?
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.
Nuts.
Listen, my stuff is good.
You can see advertising ain't my day job.
Look, you're a fair woman.
I insulted you because I'm honest.
And I apologized because I'm brave.
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.
I didn't have any control over it.
Turns out it's the only thing I can do.
-Your work's very impressive, but...
-Here's some other advantages...
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
I'm one of those people who talks back to the radio.
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.
Then you're like everyone else.
I've never been accused of that, but I really am trying.
I don't know.
You can't act like this with Don.
Like what?
-We'II call you.
-Okay.
You know, your book really does have a voice.
That's what they said about Mein Kampf.
The kid really has a voice.
-You're sure you're okay just with tea?
-Yes.
Everything tastes like sawdust to me.
Everything still tastes good to me.
Turns out I have the only kind that makes you fatter.
Look, I'm sure you're fine.
When do you find out the results?
I don't remember.
It wasn't until the third visit that I knew.
Because Hank was waiting there.
Have you told your children?
They know I'm going to the doctor a Iot, and they know I'm sick, but I've always been in a bad mood, so...
I joke with Hank.
He should just tell them I got hit by a car.
It'd be easier to deal with than saying goodbye.
The scene.
I'm leaving behind such a mess.
You're not going anywhere.
He's my second husband.
His mother's domineering.
And Don's girlfriend...
well, they're married.
She's 20 years old.
They'II never hear a nice word about me again.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.
What is it like?
well, it's like you're way out in the ocean, alone, and you're paddling,
and you see people on the shore, but they're getting farther and farther away.
And you struggle because it's natural.
Then your mind wanders back to everything normal.
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I lock the back door?
And then you just get so tired, you just give in and hope you go straight down.
That's horrible.
No one's ever asked.
hello, ladies.
I am CeciIIia, and I have the gift of sight.
could I offer you a reading?
You're gonna predict our future?
-Go ahead.
-really?
It's always good.
-Oh, my.
-What?
You're a great soul.
You mean so much to the people around you.
You're a rock.
I'm sorry.
We're done.
Thank you.
You need some more tea.
-Are you okay?
-I had drinks with Mohawk.
I sat down with two of them and I swear by the end there were three.
Did you hire him?
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.
Define crazy for a copywriter.
sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority, drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?
-Who smells like pee?
-Writers.
Just hire him.
I can't.
Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.
I order you to bring him in.
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.
Why would you do that?
I wanted to smooth the ground about working with a Jew.
Turns out everybody's got one now.
tell you the truth, it makes the agency more modern.
Between that and it's always darkest before the dawn over there.
At least this one we're hiring on purpose.
I can find another Jew, if that's what you care about.
Look, I know what you're afraid of.
Sweetheart, no one's gonna replace you.
I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.
I just think Don will hate him, and then he'II hate me.
I'II be there.
I'II handle Don.
-How can you hear anything?
-I'm following your advice.
I'm being bathed in commercials.
My God, you're so square, you've got corners.
I have to make sure I Iook like the man.
If Betty calls, you know, or the kids, tell them I'II call them in the morning.
What did she want anyway?
Who knows?
well, have fun.
And I don't mean that.
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.
Nice to see you.
-We're here to see the rolling Stones.
-They're not here.
well, actually, we're here to see their manager, alien klein.
-He's not here either.
-I'm Harry Crane.
I'm on the list.
There's no list.
will you let us know when they get here?
Sir, I promise you'II know.
should have talked him out of this at the dinner table.
well, we either wait for them to show up or wait for them to come out of there.
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'II trade him a joint for a cigarette.
You can have one for free.
No, I just wanted to make sure you guys weren't cops.
Can you light this for me?
-There's a cop right over there.
-He's cool.
-What are you doing?
-They're cool.
They don't look cool.
-What are you two doing here?
-We're here on business.
-What kind of business?
-Advertising.
Like Bewitched?
You're Derwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.
Are you sure you want to?
It's been too long.
I thought that's what you wanted.
You know who has the best stuff?
-CharIton Heston.
-Who's that?
We went to his house, he came out naked.
He's a very good-Iooking man.
I guess if I Iooked like that, I would be naked a Iot, too.
In fairness, I don't think he knew we were there.
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.
We wanted him to be the voice of VapoRub.
Right?
WouIdn't that be perfect?
She just said she doesn't know who he is.
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.
-Thank you.
-No, just HaroId.
-Who'd you tell them I was?
-Just go.
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.
I'II send for you.
She knows what she's doing.
You really think you're gonna get the rolling Stones
-to do a TV ad?
-They did one for cereal in england.
It must have been a Iong time ago.
It was three years ago.
When you were probably, what, 1 1 ?
You see someone do that in a movie?
You need to relax.
So what do you Iike so much about the rolling Stones?
Why don't you get me backstage and you'II see?
What do you feel when you hear them?
Brian Jones.
He's a troubadour.
So you feel romantic.
God, you're like a psychiatrist.
What do you know about psychiatrists?
Do you have a business card or something I couId try on the doorman?
I'II make breakfast.
If, if, if.
You know what?
I am hungry.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
So what do you think?
They gonna show?
Stop looking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.
They're gonna come right down that hallway and I'm gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.
And what do you expect to happen?
I'II get into that dressing room and I'm gonna stare at him while he tunes his guitar.
He'II see me from across the room.
I'm Lady Jane.
He'II know that.
Then what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Whatever he wants.
And what do you think he wants?
None of you want any of us to have a good time just 'cause you never did.
No, we're worried about you.
Got it!
I got it!
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.
Wait, you met them?
-They're here.
They're here.
-They're here.
Who were you talking to?
They even sounded just like them when they were singing.
They played for me.
I'm sorry I failed, Don.
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.
You want the Iast one?
There were 20.
I thought you were getting it for your family.
You know what?
Let them get their own.
You bring home a bag of food and they go at it, and there's nothing left for you.
Eat first.
That's my recommendation to people who say they're getting married and having kids.
Eat first.
-Sure you don't want it?
-Harry, you have to go.
Just let me sit here for a second.
I have to get home.
Those girls, Don.
Those young girls.
They are so much fun.
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.
You're on drugs.
You signed the Tradewinds.
Who the hell are they?
Just go inside.
What are we gonna tell Raymond?
That the rolling Stones aren't good for Heinz.
Yeah.
His daughterjust probably wanted to meet them.
I don't think they're good for her, either.
I'm gonna leave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.
-We should do this again.
-Bye, Harry.
I waited as long as I couId, but we've got to go.
really?
Drink too much with the Stones?
No, we didn't get to meet them.
well, you'II have plenty of time to tell me.
It takes forever to get to Fire island.
Did Betty call?
No.
Let's go.
Megan.
What?
I have to tell you something.
-What happened?
-It's Betty.
She might be sick.
really sick.
What?
They found a tumor.
That's terrible.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know how you'd react.
What, did you think I'd be happy?
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.
well, it affects me.
There's a possibility that it's nothing.
And if it's something, we'II deal with it.
-You know I Iove sally, and...
-No, no, no.
I don't want to have that conversation.
Great.
Then let's go.
Your trunks on the dresser.
No.
I just can't.
Megan, you are 26 years old.
So I don't understand death?
I understand you went to that concert last night, but now it's suddenly too overwhelming when we're supposed to go see my friends.
Come on.
There's nothing you can do.
It's okay.
This is very provocative.
That one.
I was at the movies.
well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.
-ShouIdn't we wait for Roger?
-For what?
He doesn't even come to the meetings that are important.
-Go on.
-There's a resume in there.
Okay.
So you were at Needham for a Iong time and a Iot of other places for a short time.
I checked his references thoroughly or I wouldn't have brought him in.
would you let him talk?
I'm opinionated, but I know if you were my boss,
I would have no problem saying, "Okay, Don."
unless you want me to call you Mr. Draper.
I worked for someone like that.
-Kirk Whitby?
-I'm not gonna say.
You wouldn't want me running all over town telling your secrets.
well, I wouldn't want you grumbling behind my back, either.
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.
I just wanted to make you smile.
I'II be honest.
I've admired you since the letter.
I thought it was the funniest thing I ever read.
And the fact that I can say "The letter" and everyone knows what I'm talking about.
I just want to be a part of this place.
I think it's on the way up.
Between you and Margaret, she's very interesting.
And I think I made it clear, so are you.
pleasure to meet you, michael.
Good work.
Thanks.
Promise me you didn't just hire the handsomest one.
Anything else?
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of throwing something through this window.
-How'd it go?
-Good.
See?
I'm proud of you.
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.
I'm sorry.
My stomach rumbles sometimes and it can sound like the "F" word.
You know, I thought you were crazy when I met you, and you have confirmed it by not acting the way that you acted with me.
You told me not to act that way.
And the fact that you can control it really scares me.
So I'm not getting the job?
No, you start tomorrow.
I would Iike to pick you up and spin you around right now, but I don't want people to think that's how I got the job.
well, I'm glad you're excited.
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.
Nobody in the world cares I got the job but you.
Then I'm happy.
I can't believe this.
You should have just gone into work.
Come on.
-Do you want me to turn down the TV?
-It's fine.
Henry Francis.
well, tell Jim His Honor is not going to Michigan.
Because Romney's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.
Because he's got a city to run.
Can we talk later?
Francis residence.
This is Betty.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
Okay.
Goodbye.
It's benign.
I knew it.
I'm so happy.
You're okay, you know.
I feel like I just got off a boat from China.
Hey, everything's okay.
No, it's good.
It's good.
It's nice to be put through the wringer and find out I'm just fat.
Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.
That's what it is, isn't it?
I don't know how many ways to tell you, but I don't see it.
I know.
-Your mother's obese.
-Hey.
Listen to me, I feel like I've been given a gift.
Like Scrooge seeing his tombstone.
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.
Saturday night was fun.
Okay.
I'd Iike to say that I've gathered you all here so you may remember how small this agency once was.
Mohawk airlines has chosen to return to sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Now, now.
I'm just pleased that after a Iong effort, I was able to sign them.
I've also hired a new copywriter and look forward to great success, with your help.
And, of course, Mr. sterling will be handling the day to day.
But rest assured, everything he knows, I'II know.
You gonna break that over its nose?
Forget everything I said before.
-Excuse me?
-That's the Iast guy I hired.
Hey.
-Roger.
-What?
little prick dangIed it in front of me and took it away.
It was disrespectful.
You know, I used to love that kid.
I would hold his hand and help him up on the swing set.
He grew up.
-What did you expect?
-I'm tired of it, Don.
I'm tired of trying to prove I still have any value around here.
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the ledge and having some kid's foot on my fingertips.
Bombs away.
Betty has cancer.
really?
I don't know.
They're waiting on tests.
well, that would solve everything.
You want me to make a call?
She probably knows already.
I'm the one that has to call.
She's a fighter.
Come on.
I just imagine them growing up without a mother.
I never had one.
Megan will try, but what are they gonna do?
How does that end up?
actual life and death.
I've given up on that.
I can't do that.
When is everything gonna get back to normal?
-Henry Francis.
-Hi, Henry.
It's Don.
hello, Don.
I wanted to know if there was any news about Betty.
I didn't realize she...
She's fine.
She's out of the woods.
-well, that's great news.
-It is.
You know, we're about to put supper on the table.
I'II let you go.
Who was it?
Nobody.
Betty's fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
You're such an optimist.
She just needs to have something to call you about.
Take you to dinner?
Sure.
Pete Fox died.
Fifty-seven years old, for crying out loud.
I don't know who that is, Pop.
Red Sox.
Right field, he played.
I got the job.
You don't say.
What do you want to eat?
What do I want to eat?
We should get girls.
An old one and a young one.
I got a rye bread and some farmer cheese.
Look at me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
-Don't you Iike it?
-It's good.
Aren't you going to finish?
I'm full.
Can I watch TV?
Go ahead.
Betty, are you ready?
It's stuck.
What about now?
Betty!
I'll get it.
Just go.
Betty?
The car is here.
What's going on?
We've got to go.
Darling, I just don't think I can go tonight.
What's the matter?
It's a woman's thing.
Is there any way you could play with pain?
It's the Junior League of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.
Your mother will be there.
It'll be very endearing.
Forgive me on the way?
Thank you.
Say au revoir.
Bonjour, Marie.
Marie, I can't understand you.
- Moustiques?
- Mosquitoes.
We can't let Heinz beat us there.
He has a name, you know.
And do you know what that is?
Are you kidding me?
He's the only man I want to please more than you.
And your father.
I'm the baby.
They miss me.
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.
I'm Canadian.
Although, for all we know, they are, too.
You know, back in Pittsburgh, everybody is pretty much who you expect them to be.
Or you know them forever.
Raymond and I met in high school.
Well, then we've been married longer than you.
- I told you he was smooth.
- How did you two meet?
- Well...
- At work.
Don was divorced.
Well, that's none of my business.
You have a teenage daughter, Emily.
- How's her summer?
- It's tough.
She's around the house all the time.
Too old for camp, too young for a job.
- I say let her enjoy it.
- I agree.
You don't sound so happy about it when I get home.
Well, the music is so loud.
Do you know the Rolling Stones, Don?
- Sure.
- The Stones.
She can't get enough of them.
The other night, she's playing this song, "Time, time is on your side..."
- Time Is On My Side.
- Yes, it is, dear.
Well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking, what if they were to sing, you know,
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?
Or something like that.
I don't know.
They're gonna be in New York.
Emily almost jumped in our bags with us when she heard we were coming.
Maybe you could, you know, get them to record it while they're here.
Well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?
Yes.
Clara, where is Roger?
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.
- You wanted to see me?
- I was waiting in my office to give you some good news.
Drinking good news?
Mohawk called.
You're welcome.
They haven't informed their agency, but I'm told it's a matter of hours.
Welcome back, suckers.
I think you should handle the account.
- So, they asked for me.
- They enjoy your company.
And since you were here when they were here, they think you know their business.
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?
So you're aware they've taken on $54 million in debt to replace their planes and there's a mechanic strike looming?
- Although they'll likely be spared.
- So far, so good.
Don and I have been trying to explain to Lane this is a daily business and we'll need a dedicated copywriter.
I don't understand why Miss Olson can't handle it.
Because these guys are gonna ask her to make drinks.
We're still paying Don, aren't we?
Don's not going to write local fare ads three times a week.
That's all it is?
Just get a guy with basic retail experience and run with it.
Congratulations.
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper, Mr. Crane to see you.
Just a minute, Dawn.
Is Don in a meeting?
He's with Mrs. Draper.
Thank you, Dawn.
You're welcome.
It's so confusing.
People keep saying that, but we haven't had any problems.
You haven't.
But out in the office, it's really hard to tell who's who.
- Hello, Harry.
- Good morning.
Backstage, Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, Saturday night, put your hands together for the Rolling Stones.
And how would you gauge their interest?
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.
- I'll drive.
- It starts at 8:00, but apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant with a first-rate veal parm.
- Nope.
- Good.
Then I will be ready at 7:30, having eaten.
Have Dawn pencil it in.
- Hello, Pauline.
- Hello, dear.
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
Aren't you sweet to come all the way over here when a phone call would have sufficed.
Are the children home?
They're at day camp.
You know that.
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.
Well, that's good to hear, I guess.
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.
- Pauline...
- And I'm sure he never shows it, but it upsets Henry when you're not there.
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.
I wasn't feeling well.
Honey, I know how it happens.
You get comfortable, and you give up a little bit, and then it just gets out of control.
There are things you can do about this.
There are pills you can take.
Why haven't you taken them?
Believe me, I would if I could.
I have a heart condition.
And honestly, at my age, I don't have to please men anymore.
But you...
Don't you want to get back into that incredible closet of yours again?
It'll be easy for you.
You're just one of those girls.
Thank you, Dawn.
- What's so funny?
- She was the most qualified.
We've got great news, but assume this is for your ample ears only.
Is it about Heinz and the Rolling Stones?
- What?
- No.
Harry's such a liar.
Baked beans and the Rolling Stones.
A client's idea if I ever heard one.
Mohawk Airlines is returning.
That's great.
That's a big fish.
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.
Well, I obviously have experience, I mean, at a low level, but I saw how it worked.
Your plate is full, and, frankly, Mohawk is going to insist on a regular copywriter.
- Someone with a penis.
- I'll work on that.
Call in books.
You're the search committee.
- Okay, when?
- Immediately.
Now, this is gonna be my account, so I don't want just some hack with retail experience.
He should be brilliant and have awards.
I want you to bring me a good-looking version of Don.
That'll be easy.
- Mrs. Francis.
- Hello.
So nice of you to see me so quickly.
Well, slow day.
What seems to be the problem?
Well, it's just that I've been wondering...
I've put on a few pounds and I haven't had much luck reducing on my own for some reason.
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier to put it on and harder to take it off.
Well, a friend told me it'd be easier if you gave me diet pills.
Just to give me a little jump-start.
Is your friend a doctor?
No.
Well, I'm not going to give you a prescription without giving you an exam.
What, for diet pills?
If you think it's necessary.
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife has a rapid weight gain, the cause is usually psychological.
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom, things that cause us to lose our self-control.
But first, we have to rule out diabetes, hyperthyroidism...
I don't need to take the pills forever.
I don't like that.
What?
Could you swallow?
Henry!
Mrs. Francis is on line one.
- Betts, you there?
- Don.
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?
I went to the doctor this morning and he found this thing.
It's a node or a nodule or something, and it's on my thyroid.
And they don't know what it is, but it's a lump, Don.
And he's sending me to the city to some specialist for tests.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I can't, Don.
I can't.
Betts, what exactly did he say?
Nothing.
You know how they are.
Do you want me to take the kids?
The kids.
The kids.
Oh, God.
Birdie.
Say what you always say.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
If I see one more Volkswagen ad with something else in it...
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toilet paper, shitbird.
Too fat.
Too thin.
Shelly Parker.
Might be a woman, God forbid.
Irony.
That's promising.
Have I lost my sense of smell, or is this good?
That's bitching.
What's this guy's name?
"Michael Ginsberg."
Nice knowing you, Mike.
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.
This is why girls don't play sports.
You've been working on Heinz for four months.
Somebody else is gonna carry the ball across the goal line?
Bringing him in for Mohawk.
I hope you like him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.
I like working with talented people.
It inspires me.
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.
Are you suddenly not competitive?
The chick who races people to the toilet?
I'm going to bring him in.
Stick to mediocre.
You'll sleep better.
Can I come in?
Of course.
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 11:00.
Tomorrow?
My boss made a call.
You told Mayor Lindsay?
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.
- I don't know if tomorrow...
- You want to wait on this?
- Well, if it is something...
- If, if, if.
Betty, let's not play that game, okay?
Come to bed.
You want some brandy?
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.
You're sweet.
I'm gonna have a brandy.
Betty.
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Joyce, hello.
How are you?
Not good.
I'm here.
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.
It's Francis now.
My husband's name is Henry, too, actually.
Look, you know what?
I'm gonna be in radiology forever.
Mrs. Darling, they're waiting for you, too.
Why are you here?
You want to get some lunch after?
I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.
You think you don't want to have lunch, but you do.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I'm going.
Hello.
I'm Peggy Olson.
Michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.
No, we're meeting here.
So what's he like?
Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?
- Excuse me?
- Don.
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.
Have a seat.
So, is Don stopping by?
No, it's just me.
- Can you hire me?
- Well, no, but I'm the first round.
Wouldn't you want to talk to the person who could hire you?
I spent three weeks dancing at that crappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.
- Yes, he is.
- Is Don a real person?
'Cause I'd really like to meet him.
I'm the person you need to impress right now.
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?
Okay.
- I liked your work.
- And I like your work.
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?
- Allen Ginsberg?
- He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.
I figured we got to be related somehow.
And what's he gonna say?
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.
Nuts.
Listen, my stuff is good.
You can see advertising ain't my day job.
Look, you're a fair woman.
I insulted you because I'm honest.
And I apologized because I'm brave.
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.
I didn't have any control over it.
Turns out it's the only thing I can do.
- Your work's very impressive, but...
- Here's some other advantages...
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
I'm one of those people who talks back to the radio.
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.
Then you're like everyone else.
I've never been accused of that, but I really am trying.
I don't know.
You can't act like this with Don.
Like what?
- We'll call you.
- Okay.
You know, your book really does have a voice.
That's what they said about Mein Kampf.
The kid really has a voice.
- You're sure you're okay just with tea?
- Yes.
Everything tastes like sawdust to me.
Everything still tastes good to me.
Turns out I have the only kind that makes you fatter.
Look, I'm sure you're fine.
When do you find out the results?
I don't remember.
It wasn't until the third visit that I knew.
Because Hank was waiting there.
Have you told your children?
They know I'm going to the doctor a lot, and they know I'm sick, but I've always been in a bad mood, so...
I joke with Hank.
He should just tell them I got hit by a car.
It'd be easier to deal with than saying goodbye.
The scene.
I'm leaving behind such a mess.
You're not going anywhere.
He's my second husband.
His mother's domineering.
And Don's girlfriend...
Well, they're married.
She's 20 years old.
They'll never hear a nice word about me again.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.
What is it like?
Well, it's like you're way out in the ocean, alone, and you're paddling,
and you see people on the shore, but they're getting farther and farther away.
And you struggle because it's natural.
Then your mind wanders back to everything normal.
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I lock the back door?
And then you just get so tired, you just give in and hope you go straight down.
That's horrible.
No one's ever asked.
Hello, ladies.
I am Cecillia, and I have the gift of sight.
Could I offer you a reading?
You're gonna predict our future?
- Go ahead.
- Really?
It's always good.
- Oh, my.
- What?
You're a great soul.
You mean so much to the people around you.
You're a rock.
I'm sorry.
We're done.
Thank you.
You need some more tea.
- Are you okay?
- I had drinks with Mohawk.
I sat down with two of them and I swear by the end there were three.
Did you hire him?
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.
Define crazy for a copywriter.
Sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority, drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?
- Who smells like pee?
- Writers.
Just hire him.
I can't.
Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.
I order you to bring him in.
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.
Why would you do that?
I wanted to smooth the ground about working with a Jew.
Turns out everybody's got one now.
Tell you the truth, it makes the agency more modern.
Between that and it's always darkest before the dawn over there.
At least this one we're hiring on purpose.
I can find another Jew, if that's what you care about.
Look, I know what you're afraid of.
Sweetheart, no one's gonna replace you.
I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.
I just think Don will hate him, and then he'll hate me.
I'll be there.
I'll handle Don.
- How can you hear anything?
- I'm following your advice.
I'm being bathed in commercials.
My God, you're so square, you've got corners.
I have to make sure I look like the man.
If Betty calls, you know, or the kids, tell them I'll call them in the morning.
What did she want anyway?
Who knows?
Well, have fun.
And I don't mean that.
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.
Nice to see you.
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones.
- They're not here.
Well, actually, we're here to see their manager, Allen Klein.
- He's not here either.
- I'm Harry Crane.
I'm on the list.
There's no list.
Will you let us know when they get here?
Sir, I promise you'll know.
Should have talked him out of this at the dinner table.
Well, we either wait for them to show up or wait for them to come out of there.
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll trade him a joint for a cigarette.
You can have one for free.
No, I just wanted to make sure you guys weren't cops.
Can you light this for me?
- There's a cop right over there.
- He's cool.
- What are you doing?
- They're cool.
They don't look cool.
- What are you two doing here?
- We're here on business.
- What kind of business?
- Advertising.
Like Bewitched?
You're Derwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.
Are you sure you want to?
It's been too long.
I thought that's what you wanted.
You know who has the best stuff?
- Charlton Heston.
- Who's that?
We went to his house, he came out naked.
He's a very good-looking man.
I guess if I looked like that, I would be naked a lot, too.
In fairness, I don't think he knew we were there.
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.
We wanted him to be the voice of VapoRub.
Right?
Wouldn't that be perfect?
She just said she doesn't know who he is.
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.
- Thank you.
- No, just Harold.
- Who'd you tell them I was?
- Just go.
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.
I'll send for you.
She knows what she's doing.
You really think you're gonna get the Rolling Stones
- to do a TV ad?
- They did one for cereal in England.
It must have been a long time ago.
It was three years ago.
When you were probably, what, 11?
You see someone do that in a movie?
You need to relax.
So what do you like so much about the Rolling Stones?
Why don't you get me backstage and you'll see?
What do you feel when you hear them?
Brian Jones.
He's a troubadour.
So you feel romantic.
God, you're like a psychiatrist.
What do you know about psychiatrists?
Do you have a business card or something I could try on the doorman?
I'll make breakfast.
If, if, if.
You know what?
I am hungry.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
So what do you think?
They gonna show?
Stop looking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.
They're gonna come right down that hallway and I'm gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.
And what do you expect to happen?
I'll get into that dressing room and I'm gonna stare at him while he tunes his guitar.
He'll see me from across the room.
I'm Lady Jane.
He'll know that.
Then what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Whatever he wants.
And what do you think he wants?
None of you want any of us to have a good time just 'cause you never did.
No, we're worried about you.
Got it!
I got it!
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.
Wait, you met them?
- They're here.
They're here.
- They're here.
Who were you talking to?
They even sounded just like them when they were singing.
They played for me.
I'm sorry I failed, Don.
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.
You want the last one?
There were 20.
I thought you were getting it for your family.
You know what?
Let them get their own.
You bring home a bag of food and they go at it, and there's nothing left for you.
Eat first.
That's my recommendation to people who say they're getting married and having kids.
Eat first.
- Sure you don't want it?
- Harry, you have to go.
Just let me sit here for a second.
I have to get home.
Those girls, Don.
Those young girls.
They are so much fun.
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.
You're on drugs.
You signed the Tradewinds.
Who the hell are they?
Just go inside.
What are we gonna tell Raymond?
That the Rolling Stones aren't good for Heinz.
Yeah.
His daughterjust probably wanted to meet them.
I don't think they're good for her, either.
I'm gonna leave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.
- We should do this again.
- Bye, Harry.
I waited as long as I could, but we've got to go.
Really?
Drink too much with the Stones?
No, we didn't get to meet them.
Well, you'll have plenty of time to tell me.
It takes forever to get to Fire Island.
Did Betty call?
No.
Let's go.
Megan.
What?
I have to tell you something.
- What happened?
- It's Betty.
She might be sick.
Really sick.
What?
They found a tumor.
That's terrible.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know how you'd react.
What, did you think I'd be happy?
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.
Well, it affects me.
There's a possibility that it's nothing.
And if it's something, we'll deal with it.
- You know I love Sally, and...
- No, no, no.
I don't want to have that conversation.
Great.
Then let's go.
Your trunks on the dresser.
No.
I just can't.
Megan, you are 26 years old.
So I don't understand death?
I understand you went to that concert last night, but now it's suddenly too overwhelming when we're supposed to go see my friends.
Come on.
There's nothing you can do.
It's okay.
This is very provocative.
That one.
I was at the movies.
Well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger?
- For what?
He doesn't even come to the meetings that are important.
- Go on.
- There's a resume in there.
Okay.
So you were at Needham for a long time and a lot of other places for a short time.
I checked his references thoroughly or I wouldn't have brought him in.
Would you let him talk?
I'm opinionated, but I know if you were my boss,
I would have no problem saying, "Okay, Don."
Unless you want me to call you Mr. Draper.
I worked for someone like that.
- Kirk Whitby?
- I'm not gonna say.
You wouldn't want me running all over town telling your secrets.
Well, I wouldn't want you grumbling behind my back, either.
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.
I just wanted to make you smile.
I'll be honest.
I've admired you since the letter.
I thought it was the funniest thing I ever read.
And the fact that I can say "The letter" and everyone knows what I'm talking about.
I just want to be a part of this place.
I think it's on the way up.
Between you and Margaret, she's very interesting.
And I think I made it clear, so are you.
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.
Good work.
Thanks.
Promise me you didn't just hire the handsomest one.
Anything else?
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of throwing something through this window.
- How'd it go?
- Good.
See?
I'm proud of you.
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.
I'm sorry.
My stomach rumbles sometimes and it can sound like the "F" word.
You know, I thought you were crazy when I met you, and you have confirmed it by not acting the way that you acted with me.
You told me not to act that way.
And the fact that you can control it really scares me.
So I'm not getting the job?
No, you start tomorrow.
I would like to pick you up and spin you around right now, but I don't want people to think that's how I got the job.
Well, I'm glad you're excited.
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.
Nobody in the world cares I got the job but you.
Then I'm happy.
I can't believe this.
You should have just gone into work.
Come on.
- Do you want me to turn down the TV?
- It's fine.
Henry Francis.
Well, tell Jim His Honor is not going to Michigan.
Because Romney's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.
Because he's got a city to run.
Can we talk later?
Francis residence.
This is Betty.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
Okay.
Goodbye.
It's benign.
I knew it.
I'm so happy.
You're okay, you know.
I feel like I just got off a boat from China.
Hey, everything's okay.
No, it's good.
It's good.
It's nice to be put through the wringer and find out I'm just fat.
Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.
That's what it is, isn't it?
I don't know how many ways to tell you, but I don't see it.
I know.
- Your mother's obese.
- Hey.
Listen to me, I feel like I've been given a gift.
Like Scrooge seeing his tombstone.
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.
Saturday night was fun.
Okay.
I'd like to say that I've gathered you all here so you may remember how small this agency once was.
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to return to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Now, now.
I'm just pleased that after a long effort, I was able to sign them.
I've also hired a new copywriter and look forward to great success, with your help.
And, of course, Mr. Sterling will be handling the day to day.
But rest assured, everything he knows, I'll know.
You gonna break that over its nose?
Forget everything I said before.
- Excuse me?
- That's the last guy I hired.
Hey.
- Roger.
- What?
Little prick dangled it in front of me and took it away.
It was disrespectful.
You know, I used to love that kid.
I would hold his hand and help him up on the swing set.
He grew up.
- What did you expect?
- I'm tired of it, Don.
I'm tired of trying to prove I still have any value around here.
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the ledge and having some kid's foot on my fingertips.
Bombs away.
Betty has cancer.
Really?
I don't know.
They're waiting on tests.
Well, that would solve everything.
You want me to make a call?
She probably knows already.
I'm the one that has to call.
She's a fighter.
Come on.
I just imagine them growing up without a mother.
I never had one.
Megan will try, but what are they gonna do?
How does that end up?
Actual life and death.
I've given up on that.
I can't do that.
When is everything gonna get back to normal?
- Henry Francis.
- Hi, Henry.
It's Don.
Hello, Don.
I wanted to know if there was any news about Betty.
I didn't realize she...
She's fine.
She's out of the woods.
- Well, that's great news.
- It is.
You know, we're about to put supper on the table.
I'll let you go.
Who was it?
Nobody.
Betty's fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
You're such an optimist.
She just needs to have something to call you about.
Take you to dinner?
Sure.
Pete Fox died.
Fifty-seven years old, for crying out loud.
I don't know who that is, Pop.
Red Sox.
Right field, he played.
I got the job.
You don't say.
What do you want to eat?
What do I want to eat?
We should get girls.
An old one and a young one.
I got a rye bread and some farmer cheese.
Look at me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
- Don't you like it?
- It's good.
Aren't you going to finish?
I'm full.
Can I watch TV?
Go ahead.
Previously on Mad Men...
Those of you who meet the qualifications will receive an interview.
- Je voudrais mas Harry.
- Good morning.
Beans, they have to be cool.
Don, you know what I'm talking about.
Things aren't perfect.
Mohawk is coming in, I brought them in.
What do you know about that?
This does not involve you, Roger.
I know what you see in her... and you could have gotten it without marrying.
Betty, are you ready?
It's stuck.
What about now?
Betty!
I'll get it.
Just go.
Betty.
The car is here!
What's going on?
We've got to go.
Darling, I just don't think I can go tonight.
What's the matter?
It's... a woman's thing.
Is there any way you could play with pain?
It's the junior league of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.
Your mother will be there.
It'll be very endearing.
Forgive me on the way?
Thank you.
Say "au revoir."
Bon jour, Marie.
Marie, I can't understand you.
- Moustiques?
- Mosquitoes.
Okay, mama.
We can't let Heinz beat us there.
He has a name, you know.
And do you know what that is?
Are you kidding me?
He's the only man I want to please more than you.
And your father.
I'm the baby.
They miss me.
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.
I'm Canadian.
Although for all we know, they are, too.
You know, back in Pittsburgh, everybody's pretty much who you expect them to be.
Or you know them forever.
Raymond and I met in high school.
Well, then we've been married longer than you.
- I told you he was smooth.
- How did you two meet?
- Well...
- At work.
Don was divorced.
Well, that's none of my business.
You have a teenage daughter, Emily.
- How's her summer?
- It's tough.
She's around the house all the time.
Too old for camp, too young for a job.
- I say let her enjoy it.
- I agree.
You don't sound so happy about it when I get home.
Well, the music is so loud.
Do you know the Rolling Stones, Don?
- Sure.
- The Stones.
She can't get enough of them.
The other night, she's playing this song "Time, Time Is On Your Side."
- "Time Is On My Side."
- Yes, it is, dear.
Well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking, what if they were to sing, you know,
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?
Or something like that.
I don't know.
They're gonna be in New York.
Emily almost jumped in our bags with us when she heard we were coming.
Maybe you could, you know, get them to record it while they're here.
Well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?
Yes?
Clara, where is Roger?
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.
You wanted to see me?
I was waiting in my office to give you some good news.
Drinking good news?
Mohawk called.
You're welcome.
They haven't informed their agency, but I'm told it's a matter of hours.
Welcome back, suckers.
I think you should handle the account.
- So, they asked for me?
- They enjoy your company.
And since you were here when they were here, they think you know their business.
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?
So you're aware they've taken on $54 million in debt to replace their planes?
And there's a mechanic strike looming.
- Although they'll likely be spared.
- So far, so good.
Don and I have been trying to explain to Lane this is a daily business and we'll need a dedicated copywriter.
I don't understand why Miss Olson can't handle it.
Because these guys are gonna ask her to make drinks.
We're still paying Don, aren't we?
Don's not going to rewrite local fare ads three times a week.
That's all it is?
Just get a guy with basic retail experience and run with it.
Congratulations!
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper.
Mr. Crane to see you.
Just a minute, Dawn.
Is Don in a meeting?
He's with Mrs. Draper.
Thank you, Dawn.
You're welcome.
It's so confusing.
People keep saying that.
But we haven't had any problems.
You haven't.
But out in the office, it's really hard to tell who's who.
- Hello, Harry.
- Good morning.
Backstage Forest Hills tennis stadium Saturday night, put your hands together for the Rolling Stones.
And how would you gauge their interest?
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.
- I'll drive.
- It starts at 8:00.
But apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant with a first-rate veal parm.
- Nope.
- Good.
Then I will be ready at 7:30 having eaten.
Have Dawn pencil it in.
- Hello, Pauline.
- Hello, dear.
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
Aren't you sweet to come all the way over here when a phone call would've sufficed?
Are the children home?
They're at day camp.
You know that.
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.
Well, that's good to hear, I guess.
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.
Pauline...
And I'm sure he never shows it, but it upsets Henry when you're not there.
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.
I wasn't feeling well.
Honey, I know how it happens.
You get comfortable and you give up a little bit.
And then it just gets out of control.
There are things you can do about this.
There are pills you can take.
Why haven't you taken them?
Believe me, I would if I could.
I have a heart condition.
And honestly, at my age,
I don't have to please men anymore.
But you...
Don't you want to get back into that incredible closet of yours again?
It'll be easy for you.
You're just one of those girls.
Thank you, Dawn.
- What's so funny?
- She was the most qualified.
We've got great news, but assume this is for your ample ears only.
Is it about Heinz and the Rolling Stones?
- What?
- No.
Harry's such a liar.
Baked beans and the Rolling Stones.
A client's idea if I ever heard one.
Mohawk airlines is returning.
That's great.
That's a big fish.
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.
Well, I obviously have experience.
- I mean, at a low level, but I saw how it worked.
- Your plate is full.
And, frankly, Mohawk is going to insist on a regular copywriter.
- Someone with a penis.
- I'll work on that.
Call in books.
You're the search committee.
- Okay, when?
- Immediately.
Now, this is gonna be my account.
So I don't want just some hack with retail experience.
He should be brilliant and have awards.
I want you to bring me a good-looking version of Don.
Oh, that'll be easy.
- Mrs. Francis.
- Hello.
So nice of you to see me so quickly.
Well, slow day.
What seems to be the well, it's just that I've been wondering--
I've put on a few pounds and I haven't had much luck reducing on my own for some reason.
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier to put it on and harder to take it off.
Well, a friend told me it'd be easier if you gave me diet pills.
Just to give me a little jump-start.
Is your friend a doctor?
No.
Well, I'm not going to give you a prescription without giving you an exam.
For diet pills?
If you think it's necessary.
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife has a rapid weight gain, the cause is usually psychological--
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom--
Things that cause us to lose our self-control.
But first, we have to rule out diabetes, hyperthyroidism.
Well, I don't need to take the pills forever.
I don't like that.
- What?
- Shh.
Could you swallow?
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
Mrs. Francis is on line one.
- Betts, you there?
- Don.
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?
I went to the doctor this morning and he found this thing.
It's a-- a node or a nodule or something and it's on my thyroid.
They don't know what it is, but it's a lump, Don.
And he's sending me to the city to some specialist for tests.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I can't, Don.
I can't.
Betts, what exactly did he say?
Well, nothing.
You know how they are.
Do you want me to take the kids?
The kids.
Oh, the kids.
Oh, God.
Birdy.
Say what you always say.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
If I see one more volkswagen ad with something else in it...
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toilet paper, shit bird.
Too fat.
Too thin.
Shelly Parker-
- Might be a woman, God forbid.
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."
Irony.
That's promising.
Have I lost my sense of smell or is this good?
That's bitchin'.
What's this guy's name?
Michael Ginsberg.
Nice knowing you, Mike.
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.
This is why girls don't play sports.
You've been working on Heinz for four months.
Somebody else is gonna carry the ball across the goal line?
Bringing him in for Mohawk.
I hope you like him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.
I like working with talented people.
It inspires me.
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.
Are you suddenly not competitive?
The chick who races people to the toilet?
I'm going to bring him in.
Stick to mediocre.
You'll sleep better.
Can I come in?
Of course.
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 11:00.
Tomorrow?
My boss made a call.
You told Mayor Lindsay?
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.
I don't know if tomorrow--
You want to wait on this?
Well, if it is something--
If, if, if.
Betty, let's not play that game, okay?
Come to bed.
You want some Brandy?
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.
You're sweet.
I'm gonna have a Brandy.
Betty.
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Joyce.
Hello.
How are you?
Not good.
I'm here.
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.
It's Francis now.
My husband's name is Henry, too, actually.
Look, you know what?
I'm gonna be in radiology forever.
Mrs. Darling, they're waiting for you, too.
Why are you here?
You want to get some lunch after?
Oh, I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.
You think you don't want to have lunch, but you do.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I'm going.
Hello.
I'm Peggy Olson.
Michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.
No, we're meeting here.
So what's he like?
Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?
- Excuse me?
- Don.
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.
Have a seat.
So is Don stopping by?
Nope, it's just me.
Can you hire me?
Well, no, but I'm the first round.
Wouldn't you want to talk to the person who could hire you?
I spent three weeks dancing at that crappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.
- Yes, he is.
- Is Don a real person?
'Cause I'd really like to meet him.
I'm the person you need to impress right now.
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?
Okay.
- I liked your work.
- And I like your work.
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?
- Allen Ginsberg?
- He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.
I figured we got to be related somehow.
And what's he gonna say?
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, nuts.
Listen, my stuff is good.
You can see advertising ain't my day job.
Look, you're a fair woman.
I insulted you because I'm honest.
And I apologized because I'm brave.
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.
I didn't have any control over it.
Turns out, it's the only thing I can do.
Your work's very impressive, but...
Here's some other advantages--
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
I'm one of those people who talks back to the radio.
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.
Then you're like everyone else.
I've never been accused of that, but I really am trying.
I don't know.
You can't act like this with Don.
Like what?
- We'll call you.
- Okay.
You know, your book really does have a voice.
That's what they said about "mein kampf."
"The kid really has a voice."
You're sure you're okay just with tea?
- Yes.
- Everything tastes like sawdust to me.
Everything still tastes good to me.
Turns out I have the only kind that makes you fatter.
Look, I'm sure you're fine.
When do you find out the results?
I don't remember.
It wasn't until the third visit that I knew.
Because Hank was waiting there.
Have you told your children?
They know I'm going to the doctor a lot.
And they know I'm sick, but I've always been in a bad mood, so...
I joke with Hank.
He should just tell them I got hit by a car.
It'd be easier to deal with than saying good-bye.
Ugh, the scene.
I'm leaving behind such a mess.
You're not going anywhere.
He's my second husband.
His mother's domineering.
And Don's girlfriend--
Well, they're married.
She's 20 years old.
They'll never hear a nice word about me again.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.
What is it like?
Well, it's like you're way out in the ocean alone and you're paddling, and you see people on the shore, but they're getting farther and farther away.
And you struggle because it's natural.
Then your mind wanders back to everything normal.
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I lock the back door?
And then you just get so tired, you just give in and hope you go straight down.
That's horrible.
No one's ever asked.
Hello, ladies.
I am Cecilia, and I have the gift of sight.
Could I offer you a reading?
You're gonna predict our future?
- Go ahead.
- Really?
It's always good.
- Oh, my.
- What?
You're a great soul.
You mean so much to the people around you.
You're a rock.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're done.
Thank you.
You need some more tea.
- Are you okay?
- I had drinks with Mohawk.
I sat down with two of them and I swear by the end there were three.
Did you hire him?
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.
Define crazy for a copywriter.
Sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority, drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?
- Who smells like pee?
- Writers.
Just hire him.
I can't.
Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.
I order you to bring him in.
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.
Why would you do that?
I wanted to smooth the ground about working with a Jew.
Turns out, everybody's got one now.
Tell you the truth, it makes the agency more modern.
Between that and "it's always darkest before the dawn" over there.
At least this one we're hiring on purpose.
I can find another Jew if that's what you care about.
Look, I know what you're afraid of.
Sweetheart, no one's gonna replace you.
Oh, I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.
I just think Don will hate him and then he'll hate me.
Oh.
I'll be there.
I'll handle Don.
- How can you hear anything?
- I'm following your advice.
I'm being bathed in commercials.
My God, you're so square, you've got corners.
I have to make sure I look like the man.
If Betty calls or, you know, the kids, tell them I'll call them in the morning.
What did she want anyway?
Who knows?
Well, have fun.
I don't mean that.
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.
Nice to see yo.
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones.
- They're not here.
Well, actually, we're here to see their manager, Allen Klein.
- He's not here, either.
- I'm Harry Crane.
- I'm on the list.
- There's no list.
Will you let us know when they get here?
Sir, I promise you'll know.
I should have talked him out of this at the dinner table.
Well, we either wait for them to show up or wait for them to come out of there.
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll trade him a joint for a cigarette.
You can have one for free.
No, I just wanted to make sure you guys weren't cops.
Can you light this for me?
There's a cop right over there.
He's cool.
- What are you doing?
- They're cool.
They don't look cool.
- What are you two doing here?
- We're here on business.
- What kind of business.
- Advertising.
Like "Bewitched"?
You're Durwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.
Are you sure you want to?
It's been too long.
I thought that's what you wanted.
You know who has the best stuff?
- Charlton Heston.
- Who's that?
We went to his house, he came out naked.
He's a very good-looking man.
I guess if I looked like that, I would be naked a lot, too.
In fairness, I don't think he knew we were there.
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.
We wanted him to be the voice of Vaporub.
Right?
Wouldn't that be perfect?
She just said she doesn't know who he is.
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.
- Thank you.
- No, just Harold.
- Who'd you tell 'em I was?
- Just go!
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.
I'll send for you.
She knows what she's doing.
You really think you're gonna get the Rolling Stones to do a TV ad?
They did one for cereal in England.
It must have been a long time ago.
It was three years ago.
When you were probably, what, 11?
You see someone do that in a movie?
You need to relax.
So what do you like so much about the Rolling Stones?
Why don't you get me backstage and you'll see.
What do you feel when you hear them?
Brian Jones.
He's a troubadour.
So you feel romantic.
God, you're like a psychiatrist.
What do you know about psychiatrists?
Do you have a business card or something I could try on the doorman?
I'll make breakfast.
If, if, if.
You know what?
I am hungry.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
So what do you think?
They gonna show?
Stop looking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.
They're gonna come right down that hallway and I'm gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.
And what do you expect to happen?
I'll get into that dressing room and I'm gonna stare at him while he tunes his guitar.
He'll see me from across the room.
I'm lady Jane.
He'll know that.
Then what are you gonna do?
Me I don't know.
Whatever he wants.
And what do you think he wants?
None of you want any of us to have a good time just 'cause you never did.
No, we're worried about you.
Got it!
I got it!
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.
- Wait, you met them?
- They're here.
They're here.
The Stones are here!
Who were you talking to?
They even sounded just like them when they were singing.
They played for me.
I'm sorry I failed, Don.
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.
You want the last one?
There were 20.
I thought you were getting it for your family.
You know what?
Let them get their own.
You bring home a bag of food and they go at it, and there's nothing left for you.
Eat first.
That's my recommendation to people who say they're getting married and having kids-
- Eat first.
- Sure you don't want it?
- Harry, you have to go.
Just let me sit here for a second.
I have to get home.
Those girls, Don.
Those young girls.
They are so much fun.
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.
You're on drugs.
You signed the trade winds.
Who the hell are they?
Just go inside.
What are we gonna tell Raymond?
That the Rolling Stones aren't good for Heinz.
Yeah.
His daughter just probably wanted to meet them.
I don't think they're good for her, either.
I'm gonna leave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.
- We should do this again.
- Bye, Harry.
I waited as long as I could, but we've got to go.
Really?
Drink too much with the Stones?
No, we didn't get to meet them.
Well, you'll have plenty of time to tell me.
It takes forever to get to Fire Island.
Did Betty call?
No.
Let's go.
Megan.
What?
I have to tell you something.
What happened?
It's Betty.
She might be sick.
Really sick.
What?
They found a tumor.
That's terrible.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know how you'd react.
What, did you think I'd be happy?
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.
Well, it affects me.
There's a possibility that it's nothing.
And if it's something, we'll deal with it.
You know I love Sally.
No, no, no.
I don't want to have that conversation.
Great.
Then let's go.
Your trunk's on the dresser.
No.
I just can't.
Megan, you are 26 years old.
So I don't understand death?
I understand you went to that concert last night, but now it's suddenly too overwhelming when we're supposed to go see my friends.
Come on.
There's nothing you can do.
It's okay.
This is very provocative.
Oh, that one.
I was at the movies.
Well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger?
- For what?
He doesn't even come to the meetings that are important.
- Go on.
- There's a resume in there.
Okay.
So you were at Needham for a long time and a lot of other places for a short time.
I checked his references thoroughly or I wouldn't have brought him in.
Would you let him talk?
Ahem.
I'm opinionated, but I know if you were my boss,
I would have no problem saying, "Okay, Don."
Unless you want me to call you "Mr. Draper."
I worked for someone like that.
Kirk Whitby?
I'm not gonna say.
You wouldn't want me running all over town telling your secrets.
Well, I wouldn't want you grumbling behind my back, either.
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.
I just wanted to make you smile.
I'll be honest.
I've admired you since the letter.
I thought it was the funniest thing I ever read.
And the fact that I can say the letter and everyone knows what I'm talking about.
I just want to be a part of this place.
I think it's on the way up.
Between you and Margaret...
She's very interesting.
And I think I made it clear, so are you.
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.
Good work.
Thanks.
Promise me you didn't just hire the handsomest one.
Anything else?
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of throwing something through this window.
- How'd it go?
- Good.
See?
I'm proud of you.
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.
Ahem, I'm sorry.
My stomach grumbles sometimes and it can sound like the F word.
You kn, I thought you were crazy when I met you, and you have confirmed it by not acting the way that you acted with me.
You told me not to act that way.
And the fact that you can control it really scares me.
So I'm not getting the job?
No, you start tomorrow.
I would like to pick you up and spin you around right now, but I don't want people to think that's how I got the job.
I'm glad you're excited.
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.
Nobody in the world cares I got the job but you.
Then I'm happy.
I can't believe this.
You should have just gone in to work.
Come on.
Do you want me to turn down the TV?
It's fine.
Henry Francis.
Well, tell Jim His Honor's not going to Michigan.
Because Romey's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.
Because he got a city to run.
Can we talk later?
Francis residence.
This is Betty.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
Okay.
Good-bye.
It's benign.
I knew it.
I'm so happy.
You're okay, you know.
I feel like I just got off a boat from China.
Hey, everything's okay.
No, it's good.
It's good.
It's nice to be put through the wringer and find out I'm just fat.
Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.
That's what it is, isn't it?
I don't know how many ways to tell you, but I don't see it.
I know.
Your mother's obese.
Hey.
Listen to me.
I feel like I've been given a gift.
Like scrooge seeing his tombstone.
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.
Saturday night was fun.
Okay.
I'd like to say that I've gathered you all here so you may remember how small this agency once was.
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to return to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Now, now.
I'm just pleased that after a long effort I was able to sign them.
I've also hired a new copywriter and look forward to great success with your help.
Oh, and, of course,
Mr. Sterling will be handling the day to day.
But rest assured, everything he knows I'll know.
You gonna break that over its nose?
Forget everything I said before.
- Excuse me?
- That's the last guy I hired.
Hey!
Ooh!
- Roger.
- What?
Little prick dangled it in front of me and took it away.
It was disrespectful.
You know, I used to love that kid.
I would hold his hand and help him up on the swing set.
He grew up.
What did you expect?
I'm tired of it, Don.
I'm tired of trying to prove I still have any value around here.
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the ledge and having some kid's foot on my fingertips.
Bombs away.
Betty has cancer.
Really?
I don't know.
They're waiting on tests.
Well, that would solve everything.
You want me to make a call?
She probably knows already.
I'm the one that has to call.
She's a fighter.
Come on.
I just imagine them growing up without a mother.
I never had one.
Megan will try, but what are they gonna do?
How does that end up?
Actual life and death.
I've given up on that.
I can't do that.
When is everything gonna get back to normal?
- Henry Francis.
- Hi, Henry.
It's Don.
Hello, Don.
I, uh...
Wanted to know if there was any news about Betty.
I didn't realize she--
She's fine.
She's out of the woods.
Well, that's great news.
It is.
You know, we're about to put supper on the table.
I'll let you go.
Who was it?
Nobody.
Betty's fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
You're such an optimist.
She just needs to have something to call you about.
Take you to dinner?
Sure.
Pete Fox died.
57 years old for crying out loud.
I don't know who that is, pop.
Red Sox.
Right field he played.
I got the job.
You don't say.
What do you want to eat?
What do I want to eat?
You should get girls.
An old one and a young one.
I got rye bread and some farmer cheese.
Look at me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Te don't you like it?
It's good.
Aren't you going to finish?
I'm full.
Can I watch TV?
Go ahead.

Previously on Mad Men...
Those of you who meet the qualifications will receive an interview.
- Je voudrais mas Harry.
- Good morning.
Beans, they have to be cool.
Don, you know what I'm talking about.
Things aren't perfect.
Mohawk is coming in, I brought them in.
What do you know about that?
This does not involve you, Roger.
I know what you see in her... and you could have gotten it without marrying.
Betty, are you ready?
( Straining )
It's stuck.
( Inhales ) What about now?
Henry:
Betty!
I'll get it.
Just go.
Betty.
The car is here!
What's going on?
We've got to go.
Darling, I just don't think I can go tonight.
What's the matter?
It's... a woman's thing.
Is there any way you could play with pain?
It's the junior league of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.
Your mother will be there.
It'll be very endearing.
Forgive me on the way?
( Sighs )
( Speaking French )
Thank you.
( Speaking French )
Say "au revoir."
Bon jour, Marie.
Marie, I can't understand you.
- Moustiques?
- Mosquitoes.
Okay, mama.
( Speaks French )
We can't let Heinz beat us there.
He has a name, you know.
And do you know what that is?
Are you kidding me?
He's the only man I want to please more than you.
And your father.
I'm the baby.
They miss me.
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.
I'm Canadian.
Although for all we know, they are, too.
You know, back in Pittsburgh, everybody's pretty much who you expect them to be.
Or you know them forever.
Raymond and I met in high school.
Well, then we've been married longer than you.
- I told you he was smooth.
- How did you two meet?
- Well...
- At work.
Don was divorced.
Well, that's none of my business.
You have a teenage daughter, Emily.
- How's her summer?
- It's tough.
She's around the house all the time.
Too old for camp, too young for a job.
- I say let her enjoy it.
- I agree.
You don't sound so happy about it when I get home.
Well, the music is so loud.
Do you know the Rolling Stones, Don?
- Sure.
- The Stones.
She can't get enough of them.
The other night, she's playing this song "Time, Time Is On Your Side."
- "Time Is On My Side."
- Yes, it is, dear.
Well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking, what if they were to sing, you know,
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?
Or something like that.
I don't know.
( Laughs )
They're gonna be in New York.
Emily almost jumped in our bags with us when she heard we were coming.
Maybe you could, you know, get them to record it while they're here.
Well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?
- Yes?
- ( Laughing )
Clara, where is Roger?
( Intercom buzzes )
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.
( Sighs )
You wanted to see me?
I was waiting in my office to give you some good news.
Drinking good news?
Mohawk called.
You're welcome.
They haven't informed their agency, but I'm told it's a matter of hours.
Welcome back, suckers.
I think you should handle the account.
- So, they asked for me?
- They enjoy your company.
And since you were here when they were here, they think you know their business.
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?
So you're aware they've taken on $54 million in debt to replace their planes?
And there's a mechanic strike looming.
- Although they'll likely be spared.
- So far, so good.
Don and I have been trying to explain to Lane this is a daily business and we'll need a dedicated copywriter.
I don't understand why Miss Olson can't handle it.
Because these guys are gonna ask her to make drinks.
We're still paying Don, aren't we?
Don's not going to rewrite local fare ads three times a week.
That's all it is?
Just get a guy with basic retail experience and run with it.
Congratulations!
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper.
Mr. Crane to see you.
Just a minute, dawn.
Is Don in a meeting?
He's with Mrs. Draper.
Thank you, dawn.
You're welcome.
It's so confusing.
People keep saying that.
But we haven't had any problems.
You haven't.
But out in the office, it's really hard to tell who's who.
- Hello, Harry.
- Good morning.
Backstage Forest Hills tennis stadium Saturday night, put your hands together for the Rolling Stones.
And how would you gauge their interest?
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.
- I'll drive.
- It starts at 8:00.
But apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant with a first-rate veal parm.
- Nope.
- Good.
Then I will be ready at 7:30 having eaten.
Have dawn pencil it in.
( TV playing )
( Knocking )
- Hello, Pauline.
- Hello, dear.
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
Aren't you sweet to come all the way over here when a phone call would've sufficed?
Are the children home?
They're at day camp.
You know that.
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.
Well, that's good to hear, I guess.
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.
Pauline...
And I'm sure he never shows it, but it upsets Henry when you're not there.
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.
I wasn't feeling well.
Honey, I know how it happens.
You get comfortable and you give up a little bit.
And then it just gets out of control.
There are things you can do about this.
There are pills you can take.
Why haven't you taken them?
Believe me, I would if I could.
I have a heart condition.
And honestly, at my age,
I don't have to please men anymore.
But you...
Don't you want to get back into that incredible closet of yours again?
( Sighs )
It'll be easy for you.
You're just one of those girls.
- Thank you, dawn.
- ( Laughs )
- What's so funny?
- She was the most qualified.
We've got great news, but assume this is for your ample ears only.
Is it about Heinz and the Rolling Stones?
- What?
- No.
Harry's such a liar.
Baked beans and the Rolling Stones.
A client's idea if I ever heard one.
Mohawk airlines is returning.
That's great.
That's a big fish.
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.
Well, I obviously have experience.
- I mean, at a low level, but I saw how it worked.
- Your plate is full.
And, frankly, Mohawk is going to insist on a regular copywriter.
- Someone with a penis.
- I'll work on that.
Call in books.
You're the search committee.
- Okay, when?
- Immediately.
Now, this is gonna be my account.
So I don't want just some hack with retail experience.
He should be brilliant and have awards.
I want you to bring me a good-looking version of Don.
Oh, that'll be easy.
- Mrs. Francis.
- Hello.
So nice of you to see me so quickly.
Well, slow day.
What seems to be the well, it's just that I've been wondering--
I've put on a few pounds and I haven't had much luck reducing on my own for some reason.
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier to put it on and harder to take it off.
Well, a friend told me it'd be easier if you gave me diet pills.
Just to give me a little jump-start.
Is your friend a doctor?
No.
Give you a prescription well, I'm not going to without giving you an exam.
For diet pills?
If you think it's necessary.
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife has a rapid weight gain, the cause is usually psychological--
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom--
Things that cause us to lose our self-control.
But first, we have to rule out diabetes, hyperthyroidism.
Well, I don't need to take the pills forever.
I don't like that.
- What?
- Shh.
Could you swallow?
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
- ( Intercom buzzes )
- Mrs. Francis is on line one.
- Betts, you there?
- Don.
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?
I went to the doctor this morning and he found this thing.
It's a-- a node or a nodule or something and it's on my thyroid.
They don't know what it is, but it's a lump, Don.
And he's sending me to the city to some specialist for tests.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I can't, Don.
I can't.
Betts, what exactly did he say?
Well, nothing.
You know how they are.
Do you want me to take the kids?
( Sighs ) The kids.
Oh, the kids.
Oh, God.
Birdy.
Say what you always say.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
( Sighs )
( Sighs )
If I see one more volkswagen ad with something else in it...
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toilet paper, shit bird.
Too fat.
Too thin.
Shelly Parker-
- Might be a woman, God forbid.
( Chuckles )
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."
Irony.
That's promising.
Have I lost my sense of smell or is this good?
( Chuckles ) That's bitchin'.
What's this guy's name?
Michael Ginsberg.
Nice knowing you, Mike.
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.
This is why girls don't play sports.
You've been working on Heinz for four months.
Somebody else is gonna carry the ball across the goal line?
Bringing him in for Mohawk.
I hope you like him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.
I like working with talented people.
It inspires me.
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.
Are you suddenly not competitive?
The chick who races people to the toilet?
I'm going to bring him in.
Stick to mediocre.
You'll sleep better.
( Sighs )
- ( Knocks )
- Henry:
Can I come in?
Of course.
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 11:00.
Tomorrow?
My boss made a call.
You told Mayor Lindsay?
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.
I don't know if tomorrow--
You want to wait on this?
Well, if it is something--
If, if, if.
Betty, let's not play that game, okay?
Come to bed.
You want some Brandy?
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.
You're sweet.
I'm gonna have a Brandy.
Betty.
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Joyce.
Hello.
How are you?
Not good.
I'm here.
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.
It's Francis now.
My husband's name is Henry, too, actually.
Look, you know what?
I'm gonna be in radiology forever.
Mrs. darling, they're waiting for you, too.
Why are you here?
You want to get some lunch after?
Oh, I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.
You think you don't want to have lunch, but you do.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I'm going.
Hello.
I'm Peggy Olson.
Michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.
No, we're meeting here.
So what's he like?
Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?
- Excuse me?
- Don.
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.
Have a seat.
So is Don stopping by?
Nope, it's just me.
Can you hire me?
Well, no, but I'm the first round.
Wouldn't you want to talk to the person who could hire you?
I spent three weeks dancing at that crappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.
- Yes, he is.
- Is Don a real person?
'Cause I'd really like to meet him.
I'm the person you need to impress right now.
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?
Okay.
- I liked your work.
- And I like your work.
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?
- Allen Ginsberg?
- He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.
I figured we got to be related somehow.
( Chuckles ) And what's he gonna say?
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, nuts.
Listen, my stuff is good.
You can see advertising ain't my day job.
Look, you're a fair woman.
I insulted you because I'm honest.
And I apologized because I'm brave.
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.
I didn't have any control over it.
Turns out, it's the only thing I can do.
Your work's very impressive, but...
Here's some other advantages--
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
I'm one of those people who talks back to the radio.
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.
Then you're like everyone else.
I've never been accused of that, but I really am trying.
I don't know.
You can't act like this with Don.
Like what?
- We'll call you.
- Okay.
You know, your book really does have a voice.
That's what they said about "mein kampf."
"The kid really has a voice."
You're sure you're okay just with tea?
- Yes.
- Everything tastes like sawdust to me.
Everything still tastes good to me.
Turns out I have the only kind that makes you fatter.
Look, I'm sure you're fine.
When do you find out the results?
I don't remember.
It wasn't until the third visit that I knew.
Because Hank was waiting there.
Have you told your children?
They know I'm going to the doctor a lot.
And they know I'm sick, but I've always been in a bad mood, so... ( Laughs ) I joke with Hank.
He should just tell them I got hit by a car.
It'd be easier to deal with than saying good-bye.
Ugh, the scene.
( Sighs )
I'm leaving behind such a mess.
You're not going anywhere.
He's my second husband.
His mother's domineering.
And Don's girlfriend--
Well, they're married.
She's 20 years old.
They'll never hear a nice word about me again.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.
What is it like?
Well, it's like you're way out in the ocean alone and you're paddling, and you see people on the shore, but they're getting farther and farther away.
And you struggle because it's natural.
Then your mind wanders back to everything normal.
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I lock the back door?
And then you just get so tired, you just give in and hope you go straight down.
That's horrible.
No one's ever asked.
Hello, ladies.
I am Cecilia, and I have the gift of sight.
Could I offer you a reading?
( Laughs ) You're gonna predict our future?
- Go ahead.
- Really?
It's always good.
- Oh, my.
- What?
You're a great soul.
You mean so much to the people around you.
You're a rock.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're done.
Thank you.
You need some more tea.
( Exhales )
( Groans )
- Are you okay?
- I had drinks with Mohawk.
I sat down with two of them and I swear by the end there were three.
Did you hire him?
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.
Define crazy for a copywriter.
Sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority, drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?
- Who smells like pee?
- Writers.
Just hire him.
I can't.
Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.
I order you to bring him in.
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.
Why would you do that?
I wanted to smooth the ground about working with a Jew.
Turns out, everybody's got one now.
Tell you the truth, it makes the agency more modern.
Between that and "it's always darkest before the dawn" over there.
At least this one we're hiring on purpose.
I can find another Jew if that's what you care about.
Look, I know what you're afraid of.
Sweetheart, no one's gonna replace you.
Oh, I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.
I just think Don will hate him and then he'll hate me.
Oh.
I'll be there.
I'll handle Don.
( Radio and TV playing )
- How can you hear anything?
- I'm following your advice.
I'm being bathed in commercials.
My God, you're so square, you've got corners.
I have to make sure I look like the man.
If Betty calls or, you know, the kids, tell them I'll call them in the morning.
What did she want anyway?
Who knows?
Well, have fun.
I don't mean that.
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.
Nice to see yo.
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones.
- They're not here.
Well, actually, we're here to see their manager, Allen Klein.
- He's not here, either.
- I'm Harry Crane.
- I'm on the list.
- There's no list.
Will you let us know when they get here?
Sir, I promise you'll know.
I should have talked him out of this at the dinner table.
Well, we either wait for them to show up or wait for them to come out of there.
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll trade him a joint for a cigarette.
You can have one for free.
No, I just wanted to make sure you guys weren't cops.
Can you light this for me?
There's a cop right over there.
He's cool.
- What are you doing?
- They're cool.
They don't look cool.
- What are you two doing here?
- We're here on business.
- What kind of business.
- Advertising.
Like "Bewitched"?
You're Durwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.
Are you sure you want to?
It's been too long.
I thought that's what you wanted.
You know who has the best stuff?
- Charlton Heston.
- Who's that?
We went to his house, he came out naked.
He's a very good-looking man.
I guess if I looked like that, I would be naked a lot, too.
In fairness, I don't think he knew we were there.
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.
We wanted him to be the voice of Vaporub.
Right?
Wouldn't that be perfect?
She just said she doesn't know who he is.
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.
- Thank you.
- No, just Harold.
- Who'd you tell 'em I was?
- Just go!
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.
I'll send for you.
She knows what she's doing.
You really think you're gonna get the Rolling Stones to do a TV ad?
They did one for cereal in England.
It must have been a long time ago.
It was three years ago.
When you were probably, what, 11?
You see someone do that in a movie?
You need to relax.
So what do you like so much about the Rolling Stones?
Why don't you get me backstage and you'll see.
What do you feel when you hear them?
Brian Jones.
He's a troubadour.
So you feel romantic.
God, you're like a psychiatrist.
What do you know about psychiatrists?
Do you have a business card or something I could try on the doorman?
I'll make breakfast.
If, if, if.
You know what?
I am hungry.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
So what do you think?
They gonna show?
Stop looking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.
They're gonna come right down that hallway and I'm gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.
And what do you expect to happen?
I'll get into that dressing room and I'm gonna stare at him while he tunes his guitar.
He'll see me from across the room.
I'm lady Jane.
He'll know that.
Then what are you gonna do?
Me I don't know.
Whatever he wants.
And what do you think he wants?
None of you want any of us to have a good time just 'cause you never did.
No, we're worried about you.
( Helicopter whirring )
Got it!
I got it!
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.
- Wait, you met them?
- Man:
They're here.
They're here.
Woman:
The Stones are here!
( Screaming )
Who were you talking to?
They even sounded just like them when they were singing.
They played for me.
I'm sorry I failed, Don.
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.
You want the last one?
There were 20.
I thought you were getting it for your family.
You know what?
Let them get their own.
You bring home a bag of food and they go at it, and there's nothing left for you.
Eat first.
That's my recommendation to people who say they're getting married and having kids-
- Eat first.
- Sure you don't want it?
- Harry, you have to go.
Just let me sit here for a second.
I have to get home.
Those girls, Don.
Those young girls.
They are so much fun.
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.
You're on drugs.
You signed the trade winds.
Who the hell are they?
Just go inside.
What are we gonna tell Raymond?
That the Rolling Stones aren't good for Heinz.
Yeah.
His daughter just probably wanted to meet them.
I don't think they're good for her, either.
( Sighs )
I'm gonna leave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.
- We should do this again.
- Bye, Harry.
( Starts engine )
I waited as long as I could, but we've got to go.
( Groans )
Really?
Drink too much with the Stones?
No, we didn't get to meet them.
Well, you'll have plenty of time to tell me.
It takes forever to get to Fire Island.
Did Betty call?
No.
Let's go.
Megan.
What?
I have to tell you something.
What happened?
It's Betty.
She might be sick.
Really sick.
What?
They found a tumor.
That's terrible.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know how you'd react.
What, did you think I'd be happy?
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.
Well, it affects me.
There's a possibility that it's nothing.
And if it's something, we'll deal with it.
You know I love Sally.
No, no, no.
I don't want to have that conversation.
Great.
Then let's go.
Your trunk's on the dresser.
No.
I just can't.
Megan, you are 26 years old.
So I don't understand death?
I understand you went to that concert last night, but now it's suddenly too overwhelming when we're supposed to go see my friends.
Come on.
There's nothing you can do.
It's okay.
( Children giggling )
This is very provocative.
Oh, that one.
I was at the movies.
Well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger?
- For what?
He doesn't even come to the meetings that are important.
- Go on.
- There's a resume in there.
Okay.
So you were at Needham for a long time and a lot of other places for a short time.
I checked his references thoroughly or I wouldn't have brought him in.
Would you let him talk?
Ahem.
I'm opinionated, but I know if you were my boss,
I would have no problem saying, "Okay, Don."
Unless you want me to call you "Mr. Draper."
I worked for someone like that.
Kirk Whitby?
I'm not gonna say.
You wouldn't want me running all over town telling your secrets.
Well, I wouldn't want you grumbling behind my back, either.
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.
I just wanted to make you smile.
I'll be honest.
I've admired you since the letter.
I thought it was the funniest thing I ever read.
And the fact that I can say the letter and everyone knows what I'm talking about.
I just want to be a part of this place.
I think it's on the way up.
Between you and Margaret...
She's very interesting.
And I think I made it clear, so are you.
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.
Good work.
Thanks.
Promise me you didn't just hire the handsomest one.
Anything else?
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of throwing something through this window.
- How'd it go?
- Good.
See?
I'm proud of you.
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.
Ahem, I'm sorry.
My stomach grumbles sometimes and it can sound like the F word.
You kn, I thought you were crazy when I met you, and you have confirmed it by not acting the way that you acted with me.
You told me not to act that way.
And the fact that you can control it really scares me.
So I'm not getting the job?
No, you start tomorrow.
( Laughs )
I would like to pick you up and spin you around right now, but I don't want people to think that's how I got the job.
You're excited.
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.
Nobody in the world cares I got the job but you.
Then I'm happy.
I can't believe this.
( TV playing )
( Phone rings ) you should have just gone in to work.
Come on.
Do you want me to turn down the TV?
It's fine.
Henry Francis.
Well, tell Jim His Honor's not going to Michigan.
Because Romey's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.
( Phone ringing )
Because he got a city to run.
Can we talk later?
Francis residence.
This is Betty.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
Okay.
Good-bye.
It's benign.
( Exhales )
I knew it.
I'm so happy.
( Laughs )
You're okay, you know.
I feel like I just got off a boat from China.
Hey, everything's okay.
No, it's good.
It's good.
It's nice to be put through the wringer and find out I'm just fat.
Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.
That's what it is, isn't it?
I don't know how many ways to tell you, but I don't see it.
I know.
Your mother's obese.
Hey.
Listen to me.
I feel like I've been given a gift.
Like scrooge seeing his tombstone.
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.
Saturday night was fun.
Okay.
I'd like to say that I've gathered you all here so you may remember how small this agency once was.
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to return to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Now, now.
I'm just pleased that after a long effort I was able to sign them.
A new copywriter and look forward to great success with your help.
Oh, and, of course,
Mr. Sterling will be handling the day to day.
But rest assured, everything he knows I'll know.
( Applause )
You gonna break that over its nose?
( Laughter )
Forget everything I said before.
- Excuse me?
- That's the last guy I hired.
- ( Pops )
- Hey!
Ooh!
- Roger.
- What?
Little prick dangled it in front of me and took it away.
It was disrespectful.
You know, I used to love that kid.
I would hold his hand and help him up on the swing set.
He grew up.
What did you expect?
I'm tired of it, Don.
I'm tired of trying to prove I still have any value around here.
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the ledge and having some kid's foot on my fingertips.
( Sighs ) Bombs away.
Betty has cancer.
Really?
I don't know.
They're waiting on tests.
Well, that would solve everything.
You want me to make a call?
She probably knows already.
I'm the one that has to call.
She's a fighter.
Come on.
I just imagine them growing up without a mother.
I never had one.
Megan will try, but what are they gonna do?
How does that end up?
Actual life and death.
I've given up on that.
I can't do that.
When is everything gonna get back to normal?
( Phone ringing )
- Henry Francis.
- Hi, Henry.
It's Don.
Hello, Don.
I, uh...
Wanted to know if there was any news about Betty.
I didn't realize she--
She's fine.
She's out of the woods.
Well, that's great news.
It is.
You know, we're about to put supper on the table.
I'll let you go.
Betty:
Who was it?
Nobody.
Betty's fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
You're such an optimist.
She just needs to have something to call you about.
( Sighs )
Take you to dinner?
Sure.
( Man shouting )
Pete Fox died.
57 years old for crying out loud.
I don't know who that is, pop.
Red Sox.
Right field he played.
I got the job.
You don't say.
What do you want to eat?
What do I want to eat?
You should get girls.
An old one and a young one.
I got rye bread and some farmer cheese.
Look at me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
( Speaking Hebrew )
Te don't you like it?
It's good.
Aren't you going to finish?
I'm full.
Can I watch TV?
Go ahead.

Previously on Mad Men...
Those of you who meet the qualifications will receive an interview.
- Je voudrais mas Harry.
- Good morning.
Beans, they have to be cool.
Don, you know what I'm talking about.
Things aren't perfect.
Mohawk is coming in, I brought them in.
What do you know about that?
This does not involve you, Roger.
I know what you see in her... and you could have gotten it without marrying.
Betty, are you ready?
It's stuck.
What about now?
Betty!
I'll get it.
Just go.
Betty.
The car is here!
What's going on?
We've got to go.
Darling, I just don't think I can go tonight.
What's the matter?
It's... a woman's thing.
Is there any way you could play with pain?
It's the junior league of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.
Your mother will be there.
It'll be very endearing.
Forgive me on the way?
Thank you.
Say "au revoir."
Bon jour, Marie.
Marie, I can't understand you.
- Moustiques?
- Mosquitoes.
Okay, mama.
We can't let Heinz beat us there.
He has a name, you know.
And do you know what that is?
Are you kidding me?
He's the only man I want to please more than you.
And your father.
I'm the baby.
They miss me.
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.
I'm Canadian.
Although for all we know, they are, too.
You know, back in Pittsburgh, everybody's pretty much who you expect them to be.
Or you know them forever.
Raymond and I met in high school.
Well, then we've been married longer than you.
- I told you he was smooth.
- How did you two meet?
- Well...
- At work.
Don was divorced.
Well, that's none of my business.
You have a teenage daughter, Emily.
- How's her summer?
- It's tough.
She's around the house all the time.
Too old for camp, too young for a job.
- I say let her enjoy it.
- I agree.
You don't sound so happy about it when I get home.
Well, the music is so loud.
Do you know the Rolling Stones, Don?
- Sure.
- The Stones.
She can't get enough of them.
The other night, she's playing this song "Time, Time Is On Your Side."
- "Time Is On My Side."
- Yes, it is, dear.
Well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking, what if they were to sing, you know,
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?
Or something like that.
I don't know.
They're gonna be in New York.
Emily almost jumped in our bags with us when she heard we were coming.
Maybe you could, you know, get them to record it while they're here.
Well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?
Yes?
Clara, where is Roger?
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.
You wanted to see me?
I was waiting in my office to give you some good news.
Drinking good news?
Mohawk called.
You're welcome.
They haven't informed their agency, but I'm told it's a matter of hours.
Welcome back, suckers.
I think you should handle the account.
- So, they asked for me?
- They enjoy your company.
And since you were here when they were here, they think you know their business.
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?
So you're aware they've taken on $54 million in debt to replace their planes?
And there's a mechanic strike looming.
- Although they'll likely be spared.
- So far, so good.
Don and I have been trying to explain to Lane this is a daily business and we'll need a dedicated copywriter.
I don't understand why Miss Olson can't handle it.
Because these guys are gonna ask her to make drinks.
We're still paying Don, aren't we?
Don's not going to rewrite local fare ads three times a week.
That's all it is?
Just get a guy with basic retail experience and run with it.
Congratulations!
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper.
Mr. Crane to see you.
Just a minute, dawn.
Is Don in a meeting?
He's with Mrs. Draper.
Thank you, dawn.
You're welcome.
It's so confusing.
People keep saying that.
But we haven't had any problems.
You haven't.
But out in the office, it's really hard to tell who's who.
- Hello, Harry.
- Good morning.
Backstage Forest Hills tennis stadium Saturday night, put your hands together for the Rolling Stones.
And how would you gauge their interest?
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.
- I'll drive.
- It starts at 8:00.
But apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant with a first-rate veal parm.
- Nope.
- Good.
Then I will be ready at 7:30 having eaten.
Have dawn pencil it in.
- Hello, Pauline.
- Hello, dear.
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
Aren't you sweet to come all the way over here when a phone call would've sufficed?
Are the children home?
They're at day camp.
You know that.
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.
Well, that's good to hear, I guess.
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.
Pauline...
And I'm sure he never shows it, but it upsets Henry when you're not there.
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.
I wasn't feeling well.
Honey, I know how it happens.
You get comfortable and you give up a little bit.
And then it just gets out of control.
There are things you can do about this.
There are pills you can take.
Why haven't you taken them?
Believe me, I would if I could.
I have a heart condition.
And honestly, at my age,
I don't have to please men anymore.
But you...
Don't you want to get back into that incredible closet of yours again?
It'll be easy for you.
You're just one of those girls.
Thank you, dawn.
- What's so funny?
- She was the most qualified.
We've got great news, but assume this is for your ample ears only.
Is it about Heinz and the Rolling Stones?
- What?
- No.
Harry's such a liar.
Baked beans and the Rolling Stones.
A client's idea if I ever heard one.
Mohawk airlines is returning.
That's great.
That's a big fish.
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.
Well, I obviously have experience.
- I mean, at a low level, but I saw how it worked.
- Your plate is full.
And, frankly, Mohawk is going to insist on a regular copywriter.
- Someone with a penis.
- I'll work on that.
Call in books.
You're the search committee.
- Okay, when?
- Immediately.
Now, this is gonna be my account.
So I don't want just some hack with retail experience.
He should be brilliant and have awards.
I want you to bring me a good-looking version of Don.
Oh, that'll be easy.
- Mrs. Francis.
- Hello.
So nice of you to see me so quickly.
Well, slow day.
What seems to be the well, it's just that I've been wondering--
I've put on a few pounds and I haven't had much luck reducing on my own for some reason.
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier to put it on and harder to take it off.
Well, a friend told me it'd be easier if you gave me diet pills.
Just to give me a little jump-start.
Is your friend a doctor?
No.
Give you a prescription well, I'm not going to without giving you an exam.
For diet pills?
If you think it's necessary.
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife has a rapid weight gain, the cause is usually psychological--
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom--
Things that cause us to lose our self-control.
But first, we have to rule out diabetes, hyperthyroidism.
Well, I don't need to take the pills forever.
I don't like that.
- What?
- Shh.
Could you swallow?
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
Mrs. Francis is on line one.
- Betts, you there?
- Don.
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?
I went to the doctor this morning and he found this thing.
It's a-- a node or a nodule or something and it's on my thyroid.
They don't know what it is, but it's a lump, Don.
And he's sending me to the city to some specialist for tests.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I can't, Don.
I can't.
Betts, what exactly did he say?
Well, nothing.
You know how they are.
Do you want me to take the kids?
The kids.
Oh, the kids.
Oh, God.
Birdy.
Say what you always say.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
If I see one more volkswagen ad with something else in it...
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toilet paper, shit bird.
Too fat.
Too thin.
Shelly Parker-
- Might be a woman, God forbid.
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."
Irony.
That's promising.
Have I lost my sense of smell or is this good?
That's bitchin'.
What's this guy's name?
Michael Ginsberg.
Nice knowing you, Mike.
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.
This is why girls don't play sports.
You've been working on Heinz for four months.
Somebody else is gonna carry the ball across the goal line?
Bringing him in for Mohawk.
I hope you like him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.
I like working with talented people.
It inspires me.
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.
Are you suddenly not competitive?
The chick who races people to the toilet?
I'm going to bring him in.
Stick to mediocre.
You'll sleep better.
Can I come in?
Of course.
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 11:00.
Tomorrow?
My boss made a call.
You told Mayor Lindsay?
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.
I don't know if tomorrow--
You want to wait on this?
Well, if it is something--
If, if, if.
Betty, let's not play that game, okay?
Come to bed.
You want some Brandy?
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.
You're sweet.
I'm gonna have a Brandy.
Betty.
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Joyce.
Hello.
How are you?
Not good.
I'm here.
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.
It's Francis now.
My husband's name is Henry, too, actually.
Look, you know what?
I'm gonna be in radiology forever.
Mrs. darling, they're waiting for you, too.
Why are you here?
You want to get some lunch after?
Oh, I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.
You think you don't want to have lunch, but you do.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I'm going.
Hello.
I'm Peggy Olson.
Michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.
No, we're meeting here.
So what's he like?
Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?
- Excuse me?
- Don.
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.
Have a seat.
So is Don stopping by?
Nope, it's just me.
Can you hire me?
Well, no, but I'm the first round.
Wouldn't you want to talk to the person who could hire you?
I spent three weeks dancing at that crappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.
- Yes, he is.
- Is Don a real person?
'Cause I'd really like to meet him.
I'm the person you need to impress right now.
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?
Okay.
- I liked your work.
- And I like your work.
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?
- Allen Ginsberg?
- He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.
I figured we got to be related somehow.
And what's he gonna say?
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, nuts.
Listen, my stuff is good.
You can see advertising ain't my day job.
Look, you're a fair woman.
I insulted you because I'm honest.
And I apologized because I'm brave.
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.
I didn't have any control over it.
Turns out, it's the only thing I can do.
Your work's very impressive, but...
Here's some other advantages--
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
I'm one of those people who talks back to the radio.
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.
Then you're like everyone else.
I've never been accused of that, but I really am trying.
I don't know.
You can't act like this with Don.
Like what?
- We'll call you.
- Okay.
You know, your book really does have a voice.
That's what they said about "mein kampf."
"The kid really has a voice."
You're sure you're okay just with tea?
- Yes.
- Everything tastes like sawdust to me.
Everything still tastes good to me.
Turns out I have the only kind that makes you fatter.
Look, I'm sure you're fine.
When do you find out the results?
I don't remember.
It wasn't until the third visit that I knew.
Because Hank was waiting there.
Have you told your children?
They know I'm going to the doctor a lot.
And they know I'm sick, but I've always been in a bad mood, so...
I joke with Hank.
He should just tell them I got hit by a car.
It'd be easier to deal with than saying good-bye.
Ugh, the scene.
I'm leaving behind such a mess.
You're not going anywhere.
He's my second husband.
His mother's domineering.
And Don's girlfriend--
Well, they're married.
She's 20 years old.
They'll never hear a nice word about me again.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.
What is it like?
Well, it's like you're way out in the ocean alone and you're paddling, and you see people on the shore, but they're getting farther and farther away.
And you struggle because it's natural.
Then your mind wanders back to everything normal.
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I lock the back door?
And then you just get so tired, you just give in and hope you go straight down.
That's horrible.
No one's ever asked.
Hello, ladies.
I am Cecilia, and I have the gift of sight.
Could I offer you a reading?
You're gonna predict our future?
- Go ahead.
- Really?
It's always good.
- Oh, my.
- What?
You're a great soul.
You mean so much to the people around you.
You're a rock.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're done.
Thank you.
You need some more tea.
- Are you okay?
- I had drinks with Mohawk.
I sat down with two of them and I swear by the end there were three.
Did you hire him?
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.
Define crazy for a copywriter.
Sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority, drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?
- Who smells like pee?
- Writers.
Just hire him.
I can't.
Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.
I order you to bring him in.
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.
Why would you do that?
I wanted to smooth the ground about working with a Jew.
Turns out, everybody's got one now.
Tell you the truth, it makes the agency more modern.
Between that and "it's always darkest before the dawn" over there.
At least this one we're hiring on purpose.
I can find another Jew if that's what you care about.
Look, I know what you're afraid of.
Sweetheart, no one's gonna replace you.
Oh, I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.
I just think Don will hate him and then he'll hate me.
Oh.
I'll be there.
I'll handle Don.
- How can you hear anything?
- I'm following your advice.
I'm being bathed in commercials.
My God, you're so square, you've got corners.
I have to make sure I look like the man.
If Betty calls or, you know, the kids, tell them I'll call them in the morning.
What did she want anyway?
Who knows?
Well, have fun.
I don't mean that.
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.
Nice to see yo.
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones.
- They're not here.
Well, actually, we're here to see their manager, Allen Klein.
- He's not here, either.
- I'm Harry Crane.
- I'm on the list.
- There's no list.
Will you let us know when they get here?
Sir, I promise you'll know.
I should have talked him out of this at the dinner table.
Well, we either wait for them to show up or wait for them to come out of there.
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll trade him a joint for a cigarette.
You can have one for free.
No, I just wanted to make sure you guys weren't cops.
Can you light this for me?
There's a cop right over there.
He's cool.
- What are you doing?
- They're cool.
They don't look cool.
- What are you two doing here?
- We're here on business.
- What kind of business.
- Advertising.
Like "Bewitched"?
You're Durwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.
Are you sure you want to?
It's been too long.
I thought that's what you wanted.
You know who has the best stuff?
- Charlton Heston.
- Who's that?
We went to his house, he came out naked.
He's a very good-looking man.
I guess if I looked like that, I would be naked a lot, too.
In fairness, I don't think he knew we were there.
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.
We wanted him to be the voice of Vaporub.
Right?
Wouldn't that be perfect?
She just said she doesn't know who he is.
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.
- Thank you.
- No, just Harold.
- Who'd you tell 'em I was?
- Just go!
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.
I'll send for you.
She knows what she's doing.
You really think you're gonna get the Rolling Stones to do a TV ad?
They did one for cereal in England.
It must have been a long time ago.
It was three years ago.
When you were probably, what, 11?
You see someone do that in a movie?
You need to relax.
So what do you like so much about the Rolling Stones?
Why don't you get me backstage and you'll see.
What do you feel when you hear them?
Brian Jones.
He's a troubadour.
So you feel romantic.
God, you're like a psychiatrist.
What do you know about psychiatrists?
Do you have a business card or something I could try on the doorman?
I'll make breakfast.
If, if, if.
You know what?
I am hungry.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
So what do you think?
They gonna show?
Stop looking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.
They're gonna come right down that hallway and I'm gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.
And what do you expect to happen?
I'll get into that dressing room and I'm gonna stare at him while he tunes his guitar.
He'll see me from across the room.
I'm lady Jane.
He'll know that.
Then what are you gonna do?
Me I don't know.
Whatever he wants.
And what do you think he wants?
None of you want any of us to have a good time just 'cause you never did.
No, we're worried about you.
Got it!
I got it!
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.
- Wait, you met them?
- They're here.
They're here.
The Stones are here!
Who were you talking to?
They even sounded just like them when they were singing.
They played for me.
I'm sorry I failed, Don.
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.
You want the last one?
There were 20.
I thought you were getting it for your family.
You know what?
Let them get their own.
You bring home a bag of food and they go at it, and there's nothing left for you.
Eat first.
That's my recommendation to people who say they're getting married and having kids-
- Eat first.
- Sure you don't want it?
- Harry, you have to go.
Just let me sit here for a second.
I have to get home.
Those girls, Don.
Those young girls.
They are so much fun.
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.
You're on drugs.
You signed the trade winds.
Who the hell are they?
Just go inside.
What are we gonna tell Raymond?
That the Rolling Stones aren't good for Heinz.
Yeah.
His daughter just probably wanted to meet them.
I don't think they're good for her, either.
I'm gonna leave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.
- We should do this again.
- Bye, Harry.
I waited as long as I could, but we've got to go.
Really?
Drink too much with the Stones?
No, we didn't get to meet them.
Well, you'll have plenty of time to tell me.
It takes forever to get to Fire Island.
Did Betty call?
No.
Let's go.
Megan.
What?
I have to tell you something.
What happened?
It's Betty.
She might be sick.
Really sick.
What?
They found a tumor.
That's terrible.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know how you'd react.
What, did you think I'd be happy?
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.
Well, it affects me.
There's a possibility that it's nothing.
And if it's something, we'll deal with it.
You know I love Sally.
No, no, no.
I don't want to have that conversation.
Great.
Then let's go.
Your trunk's on the dresser.
No.
I just can't.
Megan, you are 26 years old.
So I don't understand death?
I understand you went to that concert last night, but now it's suddenly too overwhelming when we're supposed to go see my friends.
Come on.
There's nothing you can do.
It's okay.
This is very provocative.
Oh, that one.
I was at the movies.
Well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger?
- For what?
He doesn't even come to the meetings that are important.
- Go on.
- There's a resume in there.
Okay.
So you were at Needham for a long time and a lot of other places for a short time.
I checked his references thoroughly or I wouldn't have brought him in.
Would you let him talk?
Ahem.
I'm opinionated, but I know if you were my boss,
I would have no problem saying, "Okay, Don."
Unless you want me to call you "Mr. Draper."
I worked for someone like that.
Kirk Whitby?
I'm not gonna say.
You wouldn't want me running all over town telling your secrets.
Well, I wouldn't want you grumbling behind my back, either.
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.
I just wanted to make you smile.
I'll be honest.
I've admired you since the letter.
I thought it was the funniest thing I ever read.
And the fact that I can say the letter and everyone knows what I'm talking about.
I just want to be a part of this place.
I think it's on the way up.
Between you and Margaret...
She's very interesting.
And I think I made it clear, so are you.
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.
Good work.
Thanks.
Promise me you didn't just hire the handsomest one.
Anything else?
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of throwing something through this window.
- How'd it go?
- Good.
See?
I'm proud of you.
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.
Ahem, I'm sorry.
My stomach grumbles sometimes and it can sound like the F word.
You kn, I thought you were crazy when I met you, and you have confirmed it by not acting the way that you acted with me.
You told me not to act that way.
And the fact that you can control it really scares me.
So I'm not getting the job?
No, you start tomorrow.
I would like to pick you up and spin you around right now, but I don't want people to think that's how I got the job.
You're excited.
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.
Nobody in the world cares I got the job but you.
Then I'm happy.
I can't believe this.
You should have just gone in to work.
Come on.
Do you want me to turn down the TV?
It's fine.
Henry Francis.
Well, tell Jim His Honor's not going to Michigan.
Because Romey's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.
Because he got a city to run.
Can we talk later?
Francis residence.
This is Betty.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
Okay.
Good-bye.
It's benign.
I knew it.
I'm so happy.
You're okay, you know.
I feel like I just got off a boat from China.
Hey, everything's okay.
No, it's good.
It's good.
It's nice to be put through the wringer and find out I'm just fat.
Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.
That's what it is, isn't it?
I don't know how many ways to tell you, but I don't see it.
I know.
Your mother's obese.
Hey.
Listen to me.
I feel like I've been given a gift.
Like scrooge seeing his tombstone.
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.
Saturday night was fun.
Okay.
I'd like to say that I've gathered you all here so you may remember how small this agency once was.
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to return to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Now, now.
I'm just pleased that after a long effort I was able to sign them.
A new copywriter and look forward to great success with your help.
Oh, and, of course,
Mr. Sterling will be handling the day to day.
But rest assured, everything he knows I'll know.
You gonna break that over its nose?
Forget everything I said before.
- Excuse me?
- That's the last guy I hired.
Hey!
Ooh!
- Roger.
- What?
Little prick dangled it in front of me and took it away.
It was disrespectful.
You know, I used to love that kid.
I would hold his hand and help him up on the swing set.
He grew up.
What did you expect?
I'm tired of it, Don.
I'm tired of trying to prove I still have any value around here.
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the ledge and having some kid's foot on my fingertips.
Bombs away.
Betty has cancer.
Really?
I don't know.
They're waiting on tests.
Well, that would solve everything.
You want me to make a call?
She probably knows already.
I'm the one that has to call.
She's a fighter.
Come on.
I just imagine them growing up without a mother.
I never had one.
Megan will try, but what are they gonna do?
How does that end up?
Actual life and death.
I've given up on that.
I can't do that.
When is everything gonna get back to normal?
- Henry Francis.
- Hi, Henry.
It's Don.
Hello, Don.
I, uh...
Wanted to know if there was any news about Betty.
I didn't realize she--
She's fine.
She's out of the woods.
Well, that's great news.
It is.
You know, we're about to put supper on the table.
I'll let you go.
Who was it?
Nobody.
Betty's fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
You're such an optimist.
She just needs to have something to call you about.
Take you to dinner?
Sure.
Pete Fox died.
57 years old for crying out loud.
I don't know who that is, pop.
Red Sox.
Right field he played.
I got the job.
You don't say.
What do you want to eat?
What do I want to eat?
You should get girls.
An old one and a young one.
I got rye bread and some farmer cheese.
Look at me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Te don't you like it?
It's good.
Aren't you going to finish?
I'm full.
Can I watch TV?
Go ahead.
♪ you wait, little girl, on an empty stage ♪
♪ for fate to turn the light on ♪
♪ that men will want to write on ♪

♪ baby, it's time to think ♪

Go, just go.
Sling your hook.
Fair enough.
Is there someone else?
No.
Have you got time for a drink or...
I don't know what you had to do, Dom, in prison to get by but that is in the past, you're in my world now.
Are you all right?
You just saved my life.
Rachel?
Sean?
# THEME TUNE
I'd better go.
Andy.
(GROANING)
Come on.
No.
Please, come on.
It's nearly midnight.
I've got to get home.
Have you thought any more about telling the girls?
I can't, not at the minute.
Not with a job like this one.
I hardly see them as it is, never mind -
Why don't we try and organise a Sunday off together and take them for a meal and tell them?
Together, and Dorothy.
Yeah...just not now.
Not with this job like it is.
Obviously not now.
I mean, in a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
You don't sound too convinced.
I'm tired.
Is everything OK?
It's fine.
I'm still a bit - What?
Bothered...about why you didn't tell me you and Ade had split up.
Are you going to keep picking at this?
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.
I'm just - You are.
I didn't want to talk about it.
I didn't want people coming up to me saying,
'Oh, I'm sorry to hear about you and Ade.'
I wanted time to think about things.
Properly.
Yeah, but...
I'm not on about 'people'.
I'm on about me.
Janet.
Don't analyse things to death.
'Detectives in Greater Manchester are continuing the search for the missing schoolboy, Dylan Nicols.
Following Dawn Nichols' plea yesterday for information on her eight-year-old son's whereabouts,
Manchester Police's Major Incident Team have recieved hundreds of calls with alleged sightings of Dylan in Amsterdam and Barcelona.' We want him home.
We just want him home.
'Friends, relatives and neighbours have joined a team of more than 100 -' Look, look, there's me.
'..in the search for Dylan...' Where?
(PHONE RINGING)
'..who was last seen four days ago.' (PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Uh, yeah, it is, yeah.
Tomorrow morning?
What time?
Uh...
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Yeah, that's fine.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Nine o'clock?
Thank you.
All right, bye-bye-bye.
What?
Dom's gotta have an HIV test.
That was the clinic.
I've booked him an appointment for three weeks but they've had a cancellation and they can see him tomorrow at nine.
You couldn't go with him for me, could you?
I've got my exam, my sergeant's exam.
You're on three elevens.
Look, if someone doesn't go with him then he's not going to turn up.
I've taken three hours out of the exam.
I don't want to ask Godzilla if I can have the whole morning off.
Not in the middle of this.
Why's he got to have an HIV test?
Course I will.
Course I will.
Course I'll go with him.
Is it:
A - when he arranges to meet the child?
B - when he starts walking to meet the child?
C - when he first meets the child in the park?
D - he does not commit the offence as he has not previously communicated with the child?
I think it's B - when he's walking to meet the child.
I think it's A - when he arranges to meet the child.
Well, go on, then!
What?
D. Why?
How come?
Section 15 makes it an offence for a person aged 18 or over -
(PHONE RINGING) ..or to travel with the intention of meeting a child...
DS Roper. ..the stumbling block to the offence in this question is the lack of previous communication.
Thanks.
He's here.
He has entered the building.
(MURMURING) Ooh, he's here.
He's here!
Boss, he's here.
Right, excuse me.
Who's here?
The Chief Con.
Mr Rutterford?
Aw, look at you, all star struck.
Why's he here?
They're having a gold meeting.
Here?
Mm.
Big enquiry like this, they just do.
It boosts morale allegedly and it looks good.
Do we get to sit in on it?
Of course you do, Kevin.
You and the strategic commanders.
We're going to go through to the briefing room, Andy.
Can you organise us some teas?
Thank you.
Ma'am.
A 48-year-old guy owns a sweet shop which he uses to further his paedophilic desires.
He sees a 12-year-old kid in the shop and has desires to touch him sexually.
He arranges to - Put that away.
Get on with what you're supposed to be doing.
Exam's tomorrow!
I didn't get to bed last night, Kevin.
I didn't even get home.
Get on board.
Idiot.
Mr Rutterford.
Morning.
Good morning.
Sir.
Morning, sir.
Morning, sir.
Thought we'd take it through to the briefing room.
Good, good.
The key to the whole thing, I think we all agree, is the fact that Dylan spent the entire day in the slot machine arcade on Silver Street.
He was in there for upwards of nine hours.
We've identified 47 people who went in there during those nine hours.
Gambling addicts, druggies, alcoholics, a convicted sex offender.
We've identified all 47 and we're in the process of speaking to all 47.
Can you talk me through his last known movements?
I can, yes.
The arcade manager, Michael Nash, locked up just after eight o'clock.
Dylan was hanging about outside the arcade with a little girl, Louise Armitage.
Nash knew Dylan, knew where he lived, offered to drive him home with Louise Armitage who lives four doors down from Dylan.
Nash dropped them both off on the corner at the end of their street, 8:20, we've got that on CCTV.
Louise went straight home, Dylan didn't.
Dylan said he was going to the chip shop.
Louise wanted to go with him but Dylan wouldn't let her.
Normally he will share.
We both do.
Depends who has the cash.
Why do you think he didn't want to this time, Louise?
I don't know.
Do you remember what he said?
'Bugger off, Louise.'
It was an excuse to get rid of her.
What we also know is that Dylan never went into the chip shop.
CCTV confirms that.
So he had plans other than going in the chip shop and he had to shake Louise off first.
At the minute, Louise is the last person we know spoke to him.
The last sighting is the CCTV from Netherfield Road that you've seen so much of on the news.
So he was walking away from his home and back towards Wynthenshawe.
So where he was going and who he was gonna meet is the $64 million question.
I am convinced it's someone he spoke to at that arcade, during those nine hours.
Obviously, you're talking to this Michael Nash, the arcade manager?
Oh, are we talking to Michael Nash!
I've had him in twice with one of the tier threes.
She's downstairs again with him now.
I wish that I'd taken him to the door.
Both of them.
I would have normally...only he were insisting on going buying chips.
So...
Normally... ..what do you mean, 'normally', Michael?
Have you driven Dylan home before?
I know his mother.
The thing is, I know that he's not old enough to be in the arcade and I know that he should be in school...
..but I'd rather he was there where I could keep an eye on him.
And what about this registered sex offender?
Ryan Varney, 22 years old, small-time low-life dickhead.
Mental age of a banana.
Convicted of having sex with a 12-year-old girl five years ago.
We know he spent a lot of time with Dylan that day.
He took photos of him on his phone, messing about in the arcade, and he gave him money for pop and crisps.
I've had him in twice, as well, with another tier three and she's asked him back in today.
There's an eight-year-old boy missing... who, on the day that he went missing, you gave money to and you filmed on your phone.
In an arcade that he wasn't old enough to be in.
On a day that he was meant to be in school.
We've got half of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Force out looking for this kid.
It's really important, Ryan, that you try and tell me the truth.
Do you understand that?
And what're you thinking?
I'm thinking that out of the 120-plus people we've TIE-d, one of these two knows significantly more than they're telling us at the moment.
Nash was the last adult to speak to Dylan and Varney has this child sex offence.
Beyond that, it's an instinct.
I'm just unhappy about the pair of them.
And we're thinking the boy's dead?
Statistically, historically, yeah.
I've got 30 officers doing house-to-house.
I've got 20 dedicated search officers.
Based on advice from POLSA and CATCHEM, we're moving out in concentric half-mile circles from the point of the last sighting on Netherfield Road.
What I'd like to do, Gill...
Given the nature of the inquiry - this is no reflection on the job you're doing -
I'd like to bring the review team in sooner rather than later.
Think of it as a support, too, in this instance.
Is Mandy Saunders back off maternity, then?
No.
Uh, no.
You'll be working with your ex-husband.
I assume you haven't got a problem with that?
No, sir.
Thanks for asking.
I'd rather he was there in the arcade where I know he's safe than wandering the streets which is what he'd do.
At least then I can say, hand on heart, I was trying to keep an eye on him.
How long have you known Dawn, Michael?
Five or six months.
Is something the matter, only you seem a little bit embarrassed?
I...
OK, well, I've been seeing her.
Dawn.
You mean you've been having a relationship with her?
Yeah.
What sort of relationship?
A sexual relationship?
Yeah, yeah.
Sort of, yeah.
But, obviously, my wife doesn't know.
It's OK, Michael, we're not sat here judging you.
We just want to know where Dylan is and what's happened to him.
Sweet kid.
I just want to help her and be doing something for her.
OK.
I'd like to take you back to that Monday night again, if that's all right with you, Michael?
After you dropped Dylan off.
But, before I do, when you said just now, 'sweet kid,' who were you referring to?
Well, Dawn.
But, yeah, he's a sweet kid and all.
So what we know now, Ryan, is that when you told us that you went to McDonald's after you left the arcade... ..what we know now is that, in fact, you didn't.
Because we've got CCTV from inside and outside of McDonald's on Campbell Street... and you're not in there at all.
At any point during the evening.
Did I say the one on Campbell's Street, McDonald's?
Cos it might have been that other one.
By Tesco's.
I don't normally go in that other one but I do sometimes.
OK, but you told me... that when you ordered your meal, you went and sat on the left-hand-side by the window and, opposite, you could see people standing at a bus stop, yeah?
Do you remember telling me that?
Yeah.
Did I?
Mm, Well, you wouldn't have sat on the left-hand-side at the one near Tesco's, would you?
Because there's no seating down the left-hand-side when you're facing away from the counter.
And you couldn't have seen anybody stood at any bus stops, could you?
At the one near Tesco's?
Cos it's in, like, a... like a shopping, industrial estate type of area, isn't it?
All you'd have seen is a car park.
Yeah, yeah...
I must have been in that first one, then.
No, Ryan.
That's the point.
You weren't.
Yeah, well, I must have got me days...mixed up, then.
Right.
This Monday night, this last Monday night -
That is what I normally do do.
I come home from the arcade,
I go and have my tea in McDonald's.
Most days that is what I'm doing.
This Monday was different, wasn't it, because you didn't do that.
You didn't do what you normally do.
What did you do, Ryan?
Am I under arrest?
No.
So can I go, please?
Yeah.
Any time you like.
But I'd have thought that somebody in your position would have wanted us to help you...
..rule yourself out.
He said he was going to a house in Fallowfield, 11 Enfield Road.
He said he stayed there for four or five hours.
Which, when we got there, is all boarded up.
The whole street is.
Yeah, it's a druggie squat.
He gave us a few names, people he reckons he was there with.
Bash, Smiffey, Digsy - no real names but we're gonna follow it all up with the FIO.
So could he have taken Dylan there?
He could have done but...
We searched it thoroughly.
Cellar, attic.
If he was there, he's not there now.
How are we doing with Michael Nash?
Well, the plot thickens.
Turns out he's having a relationship with Dylan's mother.
I knew there was something he wasn't telling us.
How long's he known her?
Six months.
How did he meet her?
I didn't ask.
Do you want me to find out?
Yes, I do.
Right, tomorrow.
A
- I won't be spending any more time with the press.
I'm handing it over.
It's ridiculous -
It's not ridiculous, it's necessary, but it's not an appropriate use of my time.
B - nothing to worry about - it's normal in an enquiry this high-profiled - but the review team's coming in.
(SIGHS)
Right, thank you.
Night-night.
Get some sleep.
Please remember, as you leave the building and beyond, the eyes of the media are on you 24/7.
Do not let yourself be photographed smiling or laughing, doing anything that could be misinterpreted because it will decimate the mother and these delightful people will have no compunction whatsoever, about showing it.
Are you gonna get some sleep?
Be nice, wouldn't it?
The parking's shit, apparently, outside the college.
So what do you want to do, drive over there together?
Save petrol and the hassle of trying to find more than one space.
I suppose we'd better get used to it anyway, you, driving me around, calling me 'Ma'am'.
I'm not gonna come round tonight.
I'm too tired.
Do you mind?
Something's not right.
I know, I can tell.
You're not committed to this.
I want to take it steady.
I don't want it assumed that I'll be round every night, especially when we're working silly hours.
You're right.
You're tired.
We're both tired.
We're all tired.
Yeah.
A job like this, it affects you.
Whether you like it or not, it just does.
Night-night.
Night.
Good night.
Right.
Ring me as soon as you can if... ..you know, if you want to.
Look, the point is...if the result isn't the one that you're wanting, you do get counselling straight away so...
..yeah, so - well, not that you'll need it, probably.
Hopefully, so.
(DOORBELL) That'll be Kev.
Kev?
Yeah.
Parking's a nightmare so I'm gonna leave my car here then we're gonna drive over to the college at lunchtime.
Anyway, then I can go for a drink and not have to worry about...
In fact, why don't we all go for a drink after?
Yeah?
Hopefully, probably celebrating.
Yeah?
Yeah, good luck.
And you.
Ring me.
Yeah.
We'll deal with it.
You don't have to come with me, Sean.
I'm coming with you.
Alternatively, we could always leave mine here and go in your sexy little - Yeah, like that's happening.
That's Sean McCartney's car, that sad shitheap.
Is it?
Are you and him?
What?
What?
You know, I could...
When you were going with that flashy barrister,
I'm like, 'Fair enough.
Whatever.
At least he's in her league,'
But, Jesus, Bailey, a road rat?
He's all right, is Sean.
Anyway, that flashy barrister turned out to be a complete cock, didn't he?
(PHONE RINGING)
Chatterton Banana-Bending Factory, good morning.
We've got a body.
She's just rung me.
She wants me at the scene.
Where?
Rusholme.
Is it a kid?
Is it him?
Well, it's a kid.
Right, well, I will see you when I see you.
Look, if I don't see you before lunchtime, good luck.
If I can do it, you can do it - with knobs on.
Oh, and Kevin.
If you see Kevin, give him a kiss from me.
Right, yeah, will do.
Yeah, see you.
Was that Scotty?
The kid's body's turned up.
(POLICE RADIO)
Is it him?
Good morning, DCI Murray, MIT.
I need to speak to the duty pathologist.
Can you ask whoever it is to ring me urgently?
Thanks.
On this number.
And can you flag up that we're going to need a paediatric pathologist as well as the Home Office one?
Thank you.
I want you to get on to Andy, house-to-house, starting with this street, that street, these streets along here.
Any CCTV in the vicinity going back to last Monday night.
I've seen a bus go along that road so let's find out the route, there might be more than one.
Get hold of any CCTV from any busses.
Mr Welsh, good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
I'm at the job on your division - Andy.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm with her now.
..age, clothing, hair colour.
The body appears to be our boy.
Given the situation, we're already attracting onlookers.
I'm anticipating the press being here within minutes and I've not got a tent here to cover the body for another hour so what I'm planning to do is move the body sooner rather than later.
I don't even want to wait for the pathologist.
What I don't want is the mother to see the bin.
He's in a bin.
I don't want any vultures photographing the bin.
I seem to remember there are a couple of busses going along there, 36 and 157, there might be another one.
If there's
- Janet!
Hang on.
I need a van.
A van we can get a wheelie bin in upright and I need it now.
She says she wants a van now, right now.
wheelie bin in.
I think she's planning on moving the body before the vultures descend.
..I will indeed.
Thank you.
Ta-ta...
Yeah, OK.
Speak later, bye.
Kid in a bin, eh?
I love this job, I love this job.
Do you know why?
I'm the one that gets to nail the bastard that did this to the wall by his fucking testicles.
Heather!
Good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
Can you put me through to Mr Rutterford, please?
(POLICE RADIO)
Mitch.
Is it bad news?
Hello, Mr Nash.
Have you found him?
We've come to see Dawn.
Dawn!
It's Mitch and another one.
DC Bailey.
What are you doing here, Mr Nash?
I'm a friend of the family.
Oh.
Have you found him?
Where's your mum, Dawn?
She's...
Do you want to sit down for me?
Do you want to give Cheryl a call for me, Michael?
Do you want me to sit in with you, Dawn?
Can you give Cheryl a shout for me?
Cheryl!
Dawn - You've found him!
Haven't you?
Have they found him?
Do you want to go in with Dawn, Mrs Williams?
Why don't you go make some tea?
She needs me with her.
No, she's got her mother in there with her.
This is stupid, the way I'm being treated.
I want to help her.
This isn't about you, Michael.
So if you really care about Dawn, go and put the kettle on.
We think it is Dylan.
(SOBBING) Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
(SOBBING)
Andy, Dirty Dave's rung him asking when you're available to brief the review team.
Any time this morning.
Ohh.
Are you gonna give me an answer or are you gonna make like an ostrich?
Yeah, that last one.
Tell him to tell him I'll be back in the office at half past and if he doesn't mind allowing me to kill two birds with one stone, he can join us for the briefing, all right?
Did you get that?
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Guess what?
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
I'm absolutely fucking brilliant!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey, Rachel, thanks for making me go.
It's not a problem.
Erm, Rachel?
What?
I love you.
I love you too.
See ya.
See ya.
Talk me through Michael Nash's alibi.
Nash dropped Dylan and Louise off at the end of their road at approximately 8:20pm.
Our last sighting of Dylan walking along Netherfield Road is at 8:45pm.
At 8:47, Nash is four miles away buying sweet-and-sour pork from a Chinese takeaway in Openshaw near to where he lives.
We've got the till roll.
The fellow remembers him.
He's a regular.
They had a conversation about wind turbines and solar panels.
Then, he says, he went home.
His wife and kids weren't there that night, they were visiting relatives in Sheffield but we know that he phoned her at 11pm or, at least, that a phone call was made from his house.
Whether he actually did go home before he made that phone call at 11pm, we don't know.
We found nothing to suggest otherwise but I'm not convinced.
Obviously, the onus is on us to prove he was elsewhere not him to prove he was at home.
Do you know, I'd really like to know where those takeaway cartons are.
If they're in his rubbish then we know he went straight home but if they're not then where are they?
Have you suspended his refuse collections?
I can do.
What time's the post-mortem?
Some time today, hopefully.
There's logistical issues.
You couldn't event trying to get a paediatric pathologist and our Home Office pathologist in the same city at the same time.
It will be interesting to know what's in the lad's stomach, eh?
Absolutely, it will.
What about Ryan Varney?
He's a better suspect.
He lied to us about where he was, he filmed the lad on a mobile phone, he gave him money.
His new alibi, which we're still looking at, puts him in a house less than 200 yards away from where Dylan's body turned up this morning.
He's got a previous conviction for an underage sex offence.
The other thing to say about Nash, of course, is that he's been messing about behind his wife's back.
With Dylan's mother, is the point.
How long for?
Six months.
How did he meet her?
Online.
Online dating.
Have you found his...online profile thing?
No, I didn't realise you wanted me to.
Yes, please.
Ma'am, is it all right if me and Kev get off?
Yes, go!
Good luck!
ALL:
Good luck!
Go for it, you can do it.
Sergeant's exam.
Well, break a leg.
Good luck, Kev.
Has anyone got a car, registration Sierra-Lima-Zero-Eight-Romeo-Zebra Charlie?
Red CLS?
Yeah, it's mine.
Why?
Somebody's towing it away apparently.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
Slob arse.
That's an interesting choice to spend money on for a personalised number plate, isn't it, Ma'am?
(GIGGLING)
And I'm the best man in your life ever that you've ever had anything to do with ever.
You are definitely up there with the best of them, Sean, at this present moment in time.
So, what I was thinking was we need to stop messing about, you and me, and just get married.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
No, we are...you and me, destined to be together.
Why?
Why do we always end up in bed together, eh?
Even when we haven't seen each other for years.
I mean, this has been going on, on-and-off, since we were, what?
14?
It's meant to be.
It's just so obvious.
I'm surprised I'm having to spell it out.
I'm suprised we've not thought of it sooner.
I am never going to meet anyone more fantastic than you.
You are never going to meet anyone more fantastic than me.
Just think of the fantastic kids we'll be having.
You can't fight fate.
What do you want for your tea?
You see, a fellow like Sean - and I can see he can be amusing in a limited sort of way - he's just got no ambition.
You need a fellow - Neither have you.
I do.
No, you don't.
You're a chancer.
You float along the line of least resistance.
Why am I doing this exam, then?
Why am I in MIT?
I know you all like to think I'm a knob but who gets into MIT being a knob?
Kevin, you're the exception that proves the rule.
That's why we love you.
Your sole function on this planet is to make the rest of us look good.
I saved your life!
Hello?
Yeah, it is, yeah.
What?
No, no, I'll be there.
I'm on my way.
What's up?
My brother's in hospital.
He's been involved in some sort of traffic accident.
He's unconscious.
You're kidding.
I've gotta go.
You're kidding!
What about the -
I need a taxi!
Alison?
Shit.
I'll drive you.
No, you won't.
Alison, Dom's been in an accident.
He's at hospital in Royal Oldham and he's unconscious.
That's as much as I know.
They've just rung me.
I'm gonna get round there now.
Shit.
Shit.
Fucking shit.
I'll take you!
No.
I'm taking you.
You're not missing it because of me.
Don't be daft!
Kevin!
You'd do the same for me!
I wouldn't.
We're missing a trainer, boss.
It's probably in the bin contents.
Gill?
You're interested in the stomach content.
Have you come across that before?
Sweet and sour.
Sweet and sour, kiddy's stomach content.
Can you get someone to draft an order for arresting Michael Nash?
And let's get his rubbish collection suspended.
Will do.
See you.
Oh, my God.
His profile on this dating site!
'Single mothers welcome'.
The calling card of paedophiles everywhere.
He wasn't just grooming the kid, he's groomed the family.
Have you got any biscuits, Rach?
Usual place.
I will pay you back.
Like when you burnt my kitchen?
How are you going to pay me back, Dom?
You sell your arse a few more times?
I still owe £5,000 on that car.
You weren't insured, Dominic.
You've written her car off and you're made her miss her sergeant's exam.
Do you know?
Have you any idea?
Have you got the tiniest little inkling of how much that meant to her, eh?
Do you know how hard she's worked?
And you weren't even bloody-well unconscious for more than five seconds.
It isn't his fault that the hospital rung us.
I was just happy.
So you thought you'd go for a spin in somebody else's car?
What you gonna do?
Go back to work.
Tea.
Come on.
I'll drop you off at Oldham.
OK, let's go.
You guys stay here.
We'll go around the other side.
Michael, I've come to see Dawn.
Is she in?
Yeah.
Can I have a word with you, Mr Nash, in another room?
What for?
Kitchen.
What for?
Kitchen.
Dawn, I've come here with some of my colleagues.
What's happening is they're just in the kitchen just now with Michael.
They're just arresting him.
Mickey?
Why would... (SHOUTING FROM THE KITCHEN) Why are they
- Mickey's not...
Mickey wouldn't...
Why are they arresting Mickey?
There are certain questions that we have to ask him.
Trust me, Dawn, and I know you and me have only known each other for four days...but trust me.
(SHOUTING FROM THE KITCHEN) He does need to be under arrest.
Ohh!
FROM KITCHEN:
Get off me!
Bastard!
All right.
All right.
All right.
It wasn't me, Dawn!
It wasn't me!
I wouldn't do that to Dylan!
Why would I do that to Dylan?
Ow!
Ow!
How did you get on?
Where's Kevin?
We have had some information, following a bit of joined-up thinking.
One of the cars spotted in the area where Dylan went missing, reported stolen two weeks previously, belongs to a Graham Sutherland.
Yeah?
So Sutherland is Michael Nash's brother-in-law.
Jesus!
So...
So he stole his brother-in-law's car two weeks ago.
This is so planned.
He grooms the family and then targets a car to pinch?
I missed my exam.
My brother was in an accident and I had to go to the hospital so I missed it.
Oh, my God!
Is he OK?
Yeah, he's fine.
Sorry.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, Rach - No, really.
Really.
More flowers?
Mm.
Who are they from this time?
Same.
So, from the PM we know that Dylan was strangled.
The marks left on his neck suggest a belt just under an inch wide.
There's also the imprint of what may well be a buckle, here, like he's tethered with this thing round his neck.
We took a belt off Nash when we brought him in.
Good.
Well, let's see if we can get a match.
If we don't, we got POLSA turn his house inside out.
I think what he's done is...he's been to buy this Chinese.
He's driven home in his own car, picked up this other one - this one he's nicked - went back to meet Dylan somewhere - where?
- with his glutinous bright red sweet-and-sour pork.
I'm retrieving all the stuff from the bins round the back of the arcade.
I think that's a likely candidate for where he took him, lured him.
Then he did what he did to him and we're waiting now to see if we got any CCTV of that same stolen car going over to Fallowfield later that same night when - let's assume the same night - Dylan was dumped.
Is someone interviewing Nash's wife?
Oh, yeah.
And Nash's solicitor's gone in with him, has he?
Ten minutes since.
I can confirm that this morning, a child's body was found in the Rusholme area of Manchester.
Dylan's mother, Dawn, subsequently identified her son's body.
'This afternoon, a man was arrested.
The arrested man turned out to be Michael Nash who had presented himself as a friend of the family and who, earlier in the day, had made this impassioned please.'
We just ask that Dawn be left alone in peace so that she can try... (PHONE RINGING) Hello?
Mum, it's gonna be another late one.
That's all right, love.
Are the girls all right?
Yes, Tasie made burgers at school and we've had them for our tea.
I had to add a few onions and mushrooms.
Oh, and a bit of tomato puree!
But she did very well.
It was very tasty.
Anyway, you've caught him!
Yeah, we think we have.
We've made an arrest.
I suppose you'll have a lot of paperwork to do.
Who'll be actually interviewing him, then?
Gill?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Does the name Adam Hoyle mean anything to you, Michael?
I didn't do it.
Have you ever used another name?
Following your appearance on the news this evening when you made a statement on behalf of the family outside Dawn's house, we've received a number of calls identifying you as Patrick David Whitmore.
Mud sticks.
Are you Patrick David Whitmore?
Yeah, I changed my name.
I had to.
Why did you chance your name, Michael?
Why did he go on the news like that?
He must have known people would recognise him.
They do.
They're thick.
They can't help it.
They like to put themselves at the heart of the investigation.
Look at Ian Huntley, it's a compulsion.
They're sick.
He'd get such a buzz talking to the press like that this afternoon.
That man, that gibbering, sorry, apologetic wreck... ..is one of the most calculating, cynical, evil human beings you'll ever look at.
11 counts of sexual assault.
Yeah, I was convicted of none of them.
But mud sticks.
And he still trying to damage me with it now.
Not him.
He didn't ring in.
It was his sister.
Adam Hoyle took his own life eight years ago right after you walked free from court.
Well, he brought it on himself.
I never touched him.
He lied.
He lied and he lied.
Yeah, but he was obviously sick in the head.
Hey, how was your exam?
I'm going to have to re-sit it next year.
My brother had an accident.
I missed it.
Is he...all right?
Yes, thank you.
He's fine.
We found a car, a blue Ford Fiesta, registered to your brother-in-law, Graham Sutherland.
He reported it stolen two weeks ago.
In it, in the boot... we found a trainer stuck down the side by the door.
It matches a trainer that we found on Dylan's body this morning when we removed him from the bin that he'd been left in.
Also in the car, we found takeaway containers.
In them were the remnants of sweet-and-sour pork.
What can you tell me about that, Michael?
Didn't do it.
We've identified a mark on Dylan's neck as being made by a belt buckle.
(WHIMPERING)
The mark is very similar to the buckle on your belt, the belt that we removed from you when you arrived here this evening.
What would your response be to that, Michael?
I didn't do it.
What we think happened, Michael - correct me if I'm wrong - is that you tethered Dylan with the belt while you sexually assaulted him.
Did I mention that we found semen?
Is that going to turn out to be yours, Michael?
(SOBBING)
(SOBBING AND HEAVY BREATHING)
Hi.
Hi.
I'm not stopping.
OK.
Not even for a drink.
OK.
Sorry.
It's fine.
I don't want to do this any more.
What?
I nearly went straight home and rang you but I can't.
I don't want to let you go on thinking that this is happening when it isn't.
I've tried and it isn't what I want.
I'm sorry.
I...
I said to Rach when I split up with Adrian that I didn't want to walk out of one relationship straight into another and that's exactly what I've done.
You spoke to Rachel about Adrian?
You told me you hadn't told anyone at work.
You said I was the only one that knew.
Yeah, well...
I tell Rach stuff.
Why?
She's an airhead.
She's my best friend and she's not an airhead.
She's very far from being an airhead.
She fucked up her exam.
She did not fuck up her exam.
I thought I was your best friend?
Obviously not.
So... ..that's it then, is it?
Just like that?
Why?
Time, space.
All the things I've talked about.
All the things that I've never made a secret of.
I hope
- I hope, we're friends but I can't...
I'm going now.
Hello.
You evil, pathetic, nasty, little shitbag.
What was his name, Andy?
Were you?
Having a fling with him?
No.
Does the Assistant Chief Con know you had your car repossessed?
You're not hard up, are you?
He had no enemies!
This was about the colour of his skin!
Andy, we're starting to talk about harassment.
Sean, he's asked me to be his best man.
What?
At this wedding.
What wedding?
Yours!
itfc subtitles
Is there someone else?
No.
Have you got time for a drink or...
I don't know what you had to do, Dom, in prison to get by but that is in the past, you're in my world now.
Are you all right?
You just saved my life.
Rachel?
Sean?
I'd better go.
Andy.
Come on.
No.
Please, come on.
It's nearly midnight.
I've got to get home.
Have you thought any more about telling the girls?
I can't, not at the minute.
Not with a job like this one.
I hardly see them as it is, never mind...
Why don't we try and organise a Sunday off together and take them for a meal and tell them?
Together, and Dorothy.
Yeah... just not now.
Not with this job like it is.
Obviously not now.
I mean, in a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
You don't sound too convinced.
I'm tired.
Is everything OK?
It's fine.
I'm still a bit...
What?
Bothered... about why you didn't tell me you and Ade had split up.
Are you going to keep picking at this?
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.
I'm just...
You are.
I didn't want to talk about it.
I didn't want people coming up to me saying,
'Oh, I'm sorry to hear about you and Ade.'
I wanted time to think about things.
Properly.
Yeah, but...
I'm not on about 'people'.
I'm on about me.
Janet.
Don't analyse things to death.
'Detectives in Greater Manchester are continuing the search for the missing schoolboy, Dylan Nicols.
Following Dawn Nichols' plea yesterday for information on her eight-year-old son's whereabouts,
Manchester Police's Major Incident Team have recieved hundreds of calls with alleged sightings of Dylan in Amsterdam and Barcelona.' We want him home.
We just want him home.
'Friends, relatives and neighbours have joined a team of more than 100...' Look, look, there's me.
'In the search for Dylan...' Where?
'Who was last seen four days ago.'
Hello?
Uh, yeah, it is, yeah.
Tomorrow morning?
What time?
Uh...
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Yeah, that's fine.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Nine o'clock?
Thank you.
All right, bye-bye-bye.
What?
Dom's gotta have an HIV test.
That was the clinic.
I've booked him an appointment for three weeks but they've had a cancellation and they can see him tomorrow at nine.
You couldn't go with him for me, could you?
I've got my exam, my sergeant's exam.
You're on three elevens.
Look, if someone doesn't go with him then he's not going to turn up.
I've taken three hours out of the exam.
I don't want to ask Godzilla if I can have the whole morning off.
Not in the middle of this.
Why's he got to have an HIV test?
Course I will.
Course I will.
Course I'll go with him.
Is it:
A - when he arranges to meet the child?
B - when he starts walking to meet the child?
C - when he first meets the child in the park?
D - he does not commit the offence as he has not previously communicated with the child?
I think it's B - when he's walking to meet the child.
I think it's A - when he arranges to meet the child.
Well, go on, then!
What?
D. Why?
How come?
Section 15 makes it an offence for a person aged 18 or over... or to travel with the intention of meeting a child...
DS Roper... the stumbling block to the offence in this question is the lack of previous communication.
Thanks.
He's here.
He has entered the building.
Ooh, he's here.
He's here!
Boss, he's here.
Right, excuse me.
Who's here?
The Chief Con.
Mr Rutterford?
Aw, look at you, all star struck.
Why's he here?
They're having a gold meeting.
Here?
Mm.
Big enquiry like this, they just do.
It boosts morale allegedly and it looks good.
Do we get to sit in on it?
Of course you do, Kevin.
You and the strategic commanders.
We're going to go through to the briefing room, Andy.
Can you organise us some teas?
Thank you.
Ma'am.
A 48-year-old guy owns a sweet shop which he uses to further his paedophilic desires.
He sees a 12-year-old kid in the shop and has desires to touch him sexually.
He arranges to...
Put that away.
Get on with what you're supposed to be doing.
Exam's tomorrow!
I didn't get to bed last night, Kevin.
I didn't even get home.
Get on board.
Idiot.
Mr Rutterford.
Morning.
Good morning.
Sir.
Morning, sir.
Morning, sir.
Thought we'd take it through to the briefing room.
Good, good.
The key to the whole thing, I think we all agree, is the fact that Dylan spent the entire day in the slot machine arcade on Silver Street.
He was in there for upwards of nine hours.
We've identified 47 people who went in there during those nine hours.
Gambling addicts, druggies, alcoholics, a convicted sex offender.
We've identified all 47 and we're in the process of speaking to all 47.
Can you talk me through his last known movements?
I can, yes.
The arcade manager, Michael Nash, locked up just after eight o'clock.
Dylan was hanging about outside the arcade with a little girl, Louise Armitage.
Nash knew Dylan, knew where he lived, offered to drive him home with Louise Armitage who lives four doors down from Dylan.
Nash dropped them both off on the corner at the end of their street, 8:20, we've got that on CCTV.
Louise went straight home, Dylan didn't.
Dylan said he was going to the chip shop.
Louise wanted to go with him but Dylan wouldn't let her.
Normally he will share.
We both do.
Depends who has the cash.
Why do you think he didn't want to this time, Louise?
I don't know.
Do you remember what he said?
'Bugger off, Louise.'
It was an excuse to get rid of her.
What we also know is that Dylan never went into the chip shop.
CCTV confirms that.
So he had plans other than going in the chip shop and he had to shake Louise off first.
At the minute, Louise is the last person we know spoke to him.
The last sighting is the CCTV from Netherfield Road that you've seen so much of on the news.
So he was walking away from his home and back towards Wynthenshawe.
So where he was going and who he was gonna meet is the $64 million question.
I am convinced it's someone he spoke to at that arcade, during those nine hours.
Obviously, you're talking to this Michael Nash, the arcade manager?
Oh, are we talking to Michael Nash!
I've had him in twice with one of the tier threes.
She's downstairs again with him now.
I wish that I'd taken him to the door.
Both of them.
I would have normally... only he were insisting on going buying chips.
So...
Normally... what do you mean, 'normally', Michael?
Have you driven Dylan home before?
I know his mother.
The thing is, I know that he's not old enough to be in the arcade and I know that he should be in school... but I'd rather he was there where I could keep an eye on him.
And what about this registered sex offender?
Ryan Varney, 22 years old, small-time low-life dickhead.
Mental age of a banana.
Convicted of having sex with a 12-year-old girl five years ago.
We know he spent a lot of time with Dylan that day.
He took photos of him on his phone, messing about in the arcade, and he gave him money for pop and crisps.
I've had him in twice, as well, with another tier three and she's asked him back in today.
There's an eight-year-old boy missing... who, on the day that he went missing, you gave money to and you filmed on your phone.
In an arcade that he wasn't old enough to be in.
On a day that he was meant to be in school.
We've got half of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Force out looking for this kid.
It's really important, Ryan, that you try and tell me the truth.
Do you understand that?
And what're you thinking?
I'm thinking that out of the 120-plus people we've TIE-d, one of these two knows significantly more than they're telling us at the moment.
Nash was the last adult to speak to Dylan and Varney has this child sex offence.
Beyond that, it's an instinct.
I'm just unhappy about the pair of them.
And we're thinking the boy's dead?
Statistically, historically, yeah.
I've got 30 officers doing house-to-house.
I've got 20 dedicated search officers.
Based on advice from POLSA and CATCHEM, we're moving out in concentric half-mile circles from the point of the last sighting on Netherfield Road.
What I'd like to do, Gill...
Given the nature of the inquiry... this is no reflection on the job you're doing...
I'd like to bring the review team in sooner rather than later.
Think of it as a support, too, in this instance.
Is Mandy Saunders back off maternity, then?
No.
Uh, no.
You'll be working with your ex-husband.
I assume you haven't got a problem with that?
No, sir.
Thanks for asking.
I'd rather he was there in the arcade where I know he's safe than wandering the streets which is what he'd do.
At least then I can say, hand on heart, I was trying to keep an eye on him.
How long have you known Dawn, Michael?
Five or six months.
Is something the matter, only you seem a little bit embarrassed?
I...
OK, well, I've been seeing her.
Dawn.
You mean you've been having a relationship with her?
Yeah.
What sort of relationship?
A sexual relationship?
Yeah, yeah.
Sort of, yeah.
But, obviously, my wife doesn't know.
It's OK, Michael, we're not sat here judging you.
We just want to know where Dylan is and what's happened to him.
Sweet kid.
I just want to help her and be doing something for her.
OK.
I'd like to take you back to that Monday night again, if that's all right with you, Michael?
After you dropped Dylan off.
But, before I do, when you said just now, 'sweet kid, ' who were you referring to?
Well, Dawn.
But, yeah, he's a sweet kid and all.
So what we know now, Ryan, is that when you told us that you went to McDonald's after you left the arcade... what we know now is that, in fact, you didn't.
Because we've got CCTV from inside and outside of McDonald's on Campbell Street... and you're not in there at all.
At any point during the evening.
Did I say the one on Campbell's Street, McDonald's?
Cos it might have been that other one.
By Tesco's.
I don't normally go in that other one but I do sometimes.
OK, but you told me... that when you ordered your meal, you went and sat on the left-hand-side by the window and, opposite, you could see people standing at a bus stop, yeah?
Do you remember telling me that?
Yeah.
Did I?
Mm, Well, you wouldn't have sat on the left-hand-side at the one near Tesco's, would you?
Because there's no seating down the left-hand-side when you're facing away from the counter.
And you couldn't have seen anybody stood at any bus stops, could you?
At the one near Tesco's?
Cos it's in, like, a... like a shopping, industrial estate type of area, isn't it?
All you'd have seen is a car park.
Yeah, yeah...
I must have been in that first one, then.
No, Ryan.
That's the point.
You weren't.
Yeah, well, I must have got me days... mixed up, then.
Right.
This Monday night, this last Monday night...
That is what I normally do do.
I come home from the arcade,
I go and have my tea in McDonald's.
Most days that is what I'm doing.
This Monday was different, wasn't it, because you didn't do that.
You didn't do what you normally do.
What did you do, Ryan?
Am I under arrest?
No.
So can I go, please?
Yeah.
Any time you like.
But I'd have thought that somebody in your position would have wanted us to help you... rule yourself out.
He said he was going to a house in Fallowfield, 11 Enfield Road.
He said he stayed there for four or five hours.
Which, when we got there, is all boarded up.
The whole street is.
Yeah, it's a druggie squat.
He gave us a few names, people he reckons he was there with.
Bash, Smiffey, Digsy... no real names but we're gonna follow it all up with the FIO.
So could he have taken Dylan there?
He could have done but...
We searched it thoroughly.
Cellar, attic.
If he was there, he's not there now.
How are we doing with Michael Nash?
Well, the plot thickens.
Turns out he's having a relationship with Dylan's mother.
I knew there was something he wasn't telling us.
How long's he known her?
Six months.
How did he meet her?
I didn't ask.
Do you want me to find out?
Yes, I do.
Right, tomorrow.
A
- I won't be spending any more time with the press.
I'm handing it over.
It's ridiculous...
It's not ridiculous, it's necessary, but it's not an appropriate use of my time.
B - nothing to worry about - it's normal in an enquiry this high-profiled... but the review team's coming in.
Right, thank you.
Night-night.
Get some sleep.
Please remember, as you leave the building and beyond, the eyes of the media are on you 24/7.
Do not let yourself be photographed smiling or laughing, doing anything that could be misinterpreted because it will decimate the mother and these delightful people will have no compunction whatsoever, about showing it.
Are you gonna get some sleep?
Be nice, wouldn't it?
The parking's shit, apparently, outside the college.
So what do you want to do, drive over there together?
Save petrol and the hassle of trying to find more than one space.
I suppose we'd better get used to it anyway, you, driving me around, calling me 'Ma'am'.
I'm not gonna come round tonight.
I'm too tired.
Do you mind?
Something's not right.
I know, I can tell.
You're not committed to this.
I want to take it steady.
I don't want it assumed that I'll be round every night, especially when we're working silly hours.
You're right.
You're tired.
We're both tired.
We're all tired.
Yeah.
A job like this, it affects you.
Whether you like it or not, it just does.
Night-night.
Night.
Good night.
Right.
Ring me as soon as you can if... you know, if you want to.
Look, the point is... if the result isn't the one that you're wanting, you do get counselling straight away so... yeah, so... well, not that you'll need it, probably.
- Hopefully, so.
- That'll be Kev.
Kev?
Yeah.
Parking's a nightmare so I'm gonna leave my car here then we're gonna drive over to the college at lunchtime.
Anyway, then I can go for a drink and not have to worry about...
In fact, why don't we all go for a drink after?
Yeah?
Hopefully, probably celebrating.
Yeah?
Yeah, good luck.
And you.
Ring me.
Yeah.
We'll deal with it.
You don't have to come with me, Sean.
I'm coming with you.
Alternatively, we could always leave mine here and go in your sexy little...
Yeah, like that's happening.
That's Sean McCartney's car, that sad shitheap.
Is it?
Are you and him?
What?
What?
You know, I could...
When you were going with that flashy barrister,
I'm like, 'Fair enough.
Whatever.
At least he's in her league, '
But, Jesus, Bailey, a road rat?
He's all right, is Sean.
Anyway, that flashy barrister turned out to be a complete cock, didn't he?
Chatterton Banana-Bending Factory, good morning.
We've got a body.
She's just rung me.
She wants me at the scene.
Where?
Rusholme.
Is it a kid?
Is it him?
Well, it's a kid.
Right, well, I will see you when I see you.
Look, if I don't see you before lunchtime, good luck.
If I can do it, you can do it...
with knobs on.
Oh, and Kevin.
If you see Kevin, give him a kiss from me.
Right, yeah, will do.
Yeah, see you.
Was that Scotty?
The kid's body's turned up.
Is it him?
Good morning, DCI Murray, MIT.
I need to speak to the duty pathologist.
Can you ask whoever it is to ring me urgently?
Thanks.
On this number.
And can you flag up that we're going to need a paediatric pathologist as well as the Home Office one?
Thank you.
I want you to get on to Andy, house-to-house, starting with this street, that street, these streets along here.
Any CCTV in the vicinity going back to last Monday night.
I've seen a bus go along that road so let's find out the route, there might be more than one.
Get hold of any CCTV from any busses.
Mr Welsh, good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
I'm at the job on your division...
Andy.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm with her now.
..age, clothing, hair colour.
The body appears to be our boy.
Given the situation, we're already attracting onlookers.
I'm anticipating the press being here within minutes and I've not got a tent here to cover the body for another hour so what I'm planning to do is move the body sooner rather than later.
I don't even want to wait for the pathologist.
What I don't want is the mother to see the bin.
He's in a bin.
I don't want any vultures photographing the bin.
I seem to remember there are a couple of busses going along there, 36 and 157, there might be another one.
If there's...
Janet!
Hang on.
I need a van.
A van we can get a wheelie bin in upright and I need it now.
She says she wants a van now, right now.
Wheelie bin in.
I think she's planning on moving the body before the vultures descend.
I will indeed.
Thank you.
Ta-ta...
Yeah, OK.
Speak later, bye.
Kid in a bin, eh?
I love this job, I love this job.
Do you know why?
I'm the one that gets to nail the bastard that did this to the wall by his fucking testicles.
Heather!
Good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
Can you put me through to Mr Rutterford, please?
Mitch.
Is it bad news?
Hello, Mr Nash.
Have you found him?
We've come to see Dawn.
Dawn!
It's Mitch and another one.
DC Bailey.
What are you doing here, Mr Nash?
I'm a friend of the family.
Oh.
Have you found him?
Where's your mum, Dawn?
She's...
Do you want to sit down for me?
Do you want to give Cheryl a call for me, Michael?
Do you want me to sit in with you, Dawn?
Can you give Cheryl a shout for me?
Cheryl!
Dawn...
You've found him!
Haven't you?
Have they found him?
Do you want to go in with Dawn, Mrs Williams?
Why don't you go make some tea?
She needs me with her.
No, she's got her mother in there with her.
This is stupid, the way I'm being treated.
I want to help her.
This isn't about you, Michael.
So if you really care about Dawn, go and put the kettle on.
We think it is Dylan.
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Andy, Dirty Dave's rung him asking when you're available to brief the review team.
Any time this morning.
Ohh.
Are you gonna give me an answer or are you gonna make like an ostrich?
Yeah, that last one.
Tell him to tell him I'll be back in the office at half past and if he doesn't mind allowing me to kill two birds with one stone, he can join us for the briefing, all right?
Did you get that?
Hello?
Guess what?
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
I'm absolutely fucking brilliant!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey, Rachel, thanks for making me go.
It's not a problem.
Erm, Rachel?
What?
I love you.
I love you too.
See ya.
See ya.
Talk me through Michael Nash's alibi.
Nash dropped Dylan and Louise off at the end of their road at approximately 8:20pm.
Our last sighting of Dylan walking along Netherfield Road is at 8:45pm.
At 8:47, Nash is four miles away buying sweet-and-sour pork from a Chinese takeaway in Openshaw near to where he lives.
We've got the till roll.
The fellow remembers him.
He's a regular.
They had a conversation about wind turbines and solar panels.
Then, he says, he went home.
His wife and kids weren't there that night, they were visiting relatives in Sheffield but we know that he phoned her at 11pm or, at least, that a phone call was made from his house.
Whether he actually did go home before he made that phone call at 11pm, we don't know.
We found nothing to suggest otherwise but I'm not convinced.
Obviously, the onus is on us to prove he was elsewhere not him to prove he was at home.
Do you know, I'd really like to know where those takeaway cartons are.
If they're in his rubbish then we know he went straight home but if they're not then where are they?
Have you suspended his refuse collections?
I can do.
What time's the post-mortem?
Some time today, hopefully.
There's logistical issues.
You couldn't event trying to get a paediatric pathologist and our Home Office pathologist in the same city at the same time.
It will be interesting to know what's in the lad's stomach, eh?
Absolutely, it will.
What about Ryan Varney?
He's a better suspect.
He lied to us about where he was, he filmed the lad on a mobile phone, he gave him money.
His new alibi, which we're still looking at, puts him in a house less than 200 yards away from where Dylan's body turned up this morning.
He's got a previous conviction for an underage sex offence.
The other thing to say about Nash, of course, is that he's been messing about behind his wife's back.
With Dylan's mother, is the point.
How long for?
Six months.
How did he meet her?
Online.
Online dating.
Have you found his... online profile thing?
No, I didn't realise you wanted me to.
Yes, please.
Ma'am, is it all right if me and Kev get off?
Yes, go!
- Good luck!
- Good luck!
Go for it, you can do it.
Sergeant's exam.
Well, break a leg.
Good luck, Kev.
Has anyone got a car, registration Sierra-Lima-Zero-Eight-Romeo-Zebra Charlie?
Red CLS?
Yeah, it's mine.
Why?
Somebody's towing it away apparently.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
Slob arse.
That's an interesting choice to spend money on for a personalised number plate, isn't it, Ma'am?
And I'm the best man in your life ever that you've ever had anything to do with ever.
You are definitely up there with the best of them, Sean, at this present moment in time.
So, what I was thinking was we need to stop messing about, you and me, and just get married.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
No, we are... you and me, destined to be together.
Why?
Why do we always end up in bed together, eh?
Even when we haven't seen each other for years.
I mean, this has been going on, on-and-off, since we were, what?
14?
It's meant to be.
It's just so obvious.
I'm surprised I'm having to spell it out.
I'm suprised we've not thought of it sooner.
I am never going to meet anyone more fantastic than you.
You are never going to meet anyone more fantastic than me.
Just think of the fantastic kids we'll be having.
You can't fight fate.
What do you want for your tea?
You see, a fellow like Sean...
and I can see he can be amusing in a limited sort of way...
he's just got no ambition.
You need a fellow...
Neither have you.
I do.
No, you don't.
You're a chancer.
You float along the line of least resistance.
Why am I doing this exam, then?
Why am I in MIT?
I know you all like to think I'm a knob but who gets into MIT being a knob?
Kevin, you're the exception that proves the rule.
That's why we love you.
Your sole function on this planet is to make the rest of us look good.
I saved your life!
Hello?
Yeah, it is, yeah.
What?
No, no, I'll be there.
I'm on my way.
What's up?
My brother's in hospital.
He's been involved in some sort of traffic accident.
He's unconscious.
You're kidding.
I've gotta go.
You're kidding!
What about the...
I need a taxi!
Alison?
Shit.
I'll drive you.
No, you won't.
Alison, Dom's been in an accident.
He's at hospital in Royal Oldham and he's unconscious.
That's as much as I know.
They've just rung me.
I'm gonna get round there now.
Shit.
Shit.
Fucking shit.
I'll take you!
No.
I'm taking you.
You're not missing it because of me.
Don't be daft!
Kevin!
You'd do the same for me!
I wouldn't.
We're missing a trainer, boss.
It's probably in the bin contents.
Gill?
You're interested in the stomach content.
Have you come across that before?
Sweet and sour.
Sweet and sour, kiddy's stomach content.
Can you get someone to draft an order for arresting Michael Nash?
And let's get his rubbish collection suspended.
Will do.
See you.
Oh, my God.
His profile on this dating site!
'Single mothers welcome'.
The calling card of paedophiles everywhere.
He wasn't just grooming the kid, he's groomed the family.
Have you got any biscuits, Rach?
Usual place.
I will pay you back.
Like when you burnt my kitchen?
How are you going to pay me back, Dom?
You sell your arse a few more times?
I still owe Ј5,000 on that car.
You weren't insured, Dominic.
You've written her car off and you're made her miss her sergeant's exam.
Do you know?
Have you any idea?
Have you got the tiniest little inkling of how much that meant to her, eh?
Do you know how hard she's worked?
And you weren't even bloody-well unconscious for more than five seconds.
It isn't his fault that the hospital rung us.
I was just happy.
So you thought you'd go for a spin in somebody else's car?
What you gonna do?
Go back to work.
Tea.
Come on.
I'll drop you off at Oldham.
OK, let's go.
You guys stay here.
We'll go around the other side.
Michael, I've come to see Dawn.
Is she in?
Yeah.
Can I have a word with you, Mr Nash, in another room?
What for?
Kitchen.
What for?
Kitchen.
Dawn, I've come here with some of my colleagues.
What's happening is they're just in the kitchen just now with Michael.
They're just arresting him.
Mickey?
Why would...
Why are they...
Mickey's not...
Mickey wouldn't...
Why are they arresting Mickey?
There are certain questions that we have to ask him.
Trust me, Dawn, and I know you and me have only known each other for four days... but trust me.
He does need to be under arrest.
- Ohh!
- Get off me!
Bastard!
All right.
All right.
All right.
It wasn't me, Dawn!
It wasn't me!
I wouldn't do that to Dylan!
Why would I do that to Dylan?
Ow!
Ow!
How did you get on?
Where's Kevin?
We have had some information, following a bit of joined-up thinking.
One of the cars spotted in the area where Dylan went missing, reported stolen two weeks previously, belongs to a Graham Sutherland.
Yeah?
So Sutherland is Michael Nash's brother-in-law.
Jesus!
So...
So he stole his brother-in-law's car two weeks ago.
This is so planned.
He grooms the family and then targets a car to pinch?
I missed my exam.
My brother was in an accident and I had to go to the hospital so I missed it.
Oh, my God!
Is he OK?
Yeah, he's fine.
Sorry.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, Rach...
No, really.
Really.
More flowers?
Mm.
Who are they from this time?
Same.
So, from the PM we know that Dylan was strangled.
The marks left on his neck suggest a belt just under an inch wide.
There's also the imprint of what may well be a buckle, here, like he's tethered with this thing round his neck.
We took a belt off Nash when we brought him in.
Good.
Well, let's see if we can get a match.
If we don't, we got POLSA turn his house inside out.
I think what he's done is... he's been to buy this Chinese.
He's driven home in his own car, picked up this other one... this one he's nicked... went back to meet Dylan somewhere... where?
With his glutinous bright red sweet-and-sour pork.
I'm retrieving all the stuff from the bins round the back of the arcade.
I think that's a likely candidate for where he took him, lured him.
Then he did what he did to him and we're waiting now to see if we got any CCTV of that same stolen car going over to Fallowfield later that same night when...
let's assume the same night...
Dylan was dumped.
Is someone interviewing Nash's wife?
Oh, yeah.
And Nash's solicitor's gone in with him, has he?
Ten minutes since.
I can confirm that this morning, a child's body was found in the Rusholme area of Manchester.
Dylan's mother, Dawn, subsequently identified her son's body.
'This afternoon, a man was arrested.
The arrested man turned out to be Michael Nash who had presented himself as a friend of the family and who, earlier in the day, had made this impassioned please.'
We just ask that Dawn be left alone in peace so that she can try...
Hello?
Mum, it's gonna be another late one.
That's all right, love.
Are the girls all right?
Yes, Tasie made burgers at school and we've had them for our tea.
I had to add a few onions and mushrooms.
Oh, and a bit of tomato puree!
But she did very well.
It was very tasty.
Anyway, you've caught him!
Yeah, we think we have.
We've made an arrest.
I suppose you'll have a lot of paperwork to do.
Who'll be actually interviewing him, then?
Gill?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Does the name Adam Hoyle mean anything to you, Michael?
I didn't do it.
Have you ever used another name?
Following your appearance on the news this evening when you made a statement on behalf of the family outside Dawn's house, we've received a number of calls identifying you as Patrick David Whitmore.
Well, you see, things like that... come back to haunt you.
Mud sticks.
Are you Patrick David Whitmore?
Yeah, I changed my name.
I had to.
Why did you chance your name, Michael?
Why did he go on the news like that?
He must have known people would recognise him.
They do.
They're thick.
They can't help it.
They like to put themselves at the heart of the investigation.
Look at Ian Huntley, it's a compulsion.
They're sick.
He'd get such a buzz talking to the press like that this afternoon.
That man, that gibbering, sorry, apologetic wreck... is one of the most calculating, cynical, evil human beings you'll ever look at.
11 counts of sexual assault.
Yeah, I was convicted of none of them.
But mud sticks.
And he still trying to damage me with it now.
Not him.
He didn't ring in.
It was his sister.
Adam Hoyle took his own life eight years ago right after you walked free from court.
Well, he brought it on himself.
I never touched him.
He lied.
He lied and he lied.
Yeah, but he was obviously sick in the head.
Hey, how was your exam?
I'm going to have to re-sit it next year.
My brother had an accident.
I missed it.
Is he... all right?
Yes, thank you.
He's fine.
We found a car, a blue Ford Fiesta, registered to your brother-in-law, Graham Sutherland.
He reported it stolen two weeks ago.
In it, in the boot... we found a trainer stuck down the side by the door.
It matches a trainer that we found on Dylan's body this morning when we removed him from the bin that he'd been left in.
Also in the car, we found takeaway containers.
In them were the remnants of sweet-and-sour pork.
What can you tell me about that, Michael?
Didn't do it.
We've identified a mark on Dylan's neck as being made by a belt buckle.
The mark is very similar to the buckle on your belt, the belt that we removed from you when you arrived here this evening.
What would your response be to that, Michael?
I didn't do it.
What we think happened, Michael...
correct me if I'm wrong... is that you tethered Dylan with the belt while you sexually assaulted him.
Did I mention that we found semen?
Is that going to turn out to be yours, Michael?
Hi.
Hi.
I'm not stopping.
OK.
Not even for a drink.
OK.
Sorry.
It's fine.
I don't want to do this any more.
What?
I nearly went straight home and rang you but I can't.
I don't want to let you go on thinking that this is happening when it isn't.
I've tried and it isn't what I want.
I'm sorry.
I...
I said to Rach when I split up with Adrian that I didn't want to walk out of one relationship straight into another and that's exactly what I've done.
You spoke to Rachel about Adrian?
You told me you hadn't told anyone at work.
You said I was the only one that knew.
Yeah, well...
I tell Rach stuff.
Why?
She's an airhead.
She's my best friend and she's not an airhead.
She's very far from being an airhead.
She fucked up her exam.
She did not fuck up her exam.
I thought I was your best friend?
Obviously not.
So... that's it then, is it?
Just like that?
Why?
Time, space.
All the things I've talked about.
All the things that I've never made a secret of.
I hope...
I hope, we're friends but I can't...
I'm going now.
Hello.
You evil, pathetic, nasty, little shitbag.
What was his name, Andy?
Were you?
Having a fling with him?
No.
Does the Assistant Chief Con know you had your car repossessed?
You're not hard up, are you?
He had no enemies!
This was about the colour of his skin!
Andy, we're starting to talk about harassment.
Sean, he's asked me to be his best man.
What?
At this wedding.
What wedding?
Yours!
- Go.
Sling your hook.
- Fair enough.
- Is there someone else?
- No.
Have you got time for a drink or...
I don't know what you had to do, Dom, in prison to get by.
That is in the past.
You're in my world now.
- Are you all right?
- You just saved my life,
- bugger.
- Rachel?
Sean?

I'd better go.
Andy.
- Come on.
- No.
Please, come on.
It's nearly midnight.
I've got to get home.
Have you thought any more about telling the girls?
I can't, not at the minute.
Not with a job like this one.
I hardly see them as it is, never mind -
Why don't we try and organise a Sunday off together and take them for a meal and tell them?
- Together, and Dorothy.
- Yeah... just not now.
- Not with this job like it is.
- Obviously not now.
I mean, in a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- You don't sound too convinced.
- I'm tired.
- Is everything OK?
- It's fine.
- I'm still a bit -
- What?
Bothered... about why you didn't tell me you and Ade had split up.
Are you going to keep picking at this?
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.
- I'm just -
- You are.
I didn't want to talk about it.
I didn't want people coming up to me saying,
'Oh, I'm sorry to hear about you and Ade.'
I wanted time to think about things.
Properly.
Yeah, but...
I'm not on about 'people'.
I'm on about me.
- Janet.
- Don't... analyse things to death.
Detectives in Greater Manchester are continuing the search for the missing schoolboy,
Dylan Nichols.
Following Dawn Nichols' plea yesterday for information on her eight-year-old son's whereabouts,
Manchester Police's Major Incident Team have recieved hundreds of calls with alleged sightings of Dylan in Amsterdam and Barcelona.
We want him home.
We just want him home.
Friends, relatives and neighbours have joined a team
- of more than 100 -
- Look, look, there's me.
- ..in the search for Dylan...
- Where?
..who was last seen four days ago.
Hello?
Yeah, it is, yeah.
Tomorrow morning?
What time?
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Yeah, that's fine.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Nine o'clock?
Thank you.
All right, bye-bye-bye.
What?
Dom's gotta have an HIV test.
That was the clinic.
I've booked him an appointment for three weeks but they've had a cancellation and they can see him tomorrow at nine.
You couldn't go with him for me, could you?
I've got my exam, my sergeant's exam is twelve.
You're on three elevens.
Look, if someone doesn't go with him then he's not going to turn up.
And...
I've taken three hours out of the exam.
I don't want to ask Godzilla if I can have the whole morning off.
Not in the middle of this.
Why's he got to have an HIV test?
Course I will.
Course I will.
Course I'll go with him.
Is it:
A) when he arranges to meet the child?
B) when he starts walking to meet the child?
C) when he first meets the child in the park?
D) he does not commit the offence as he has not previously communicated with the child?
I think it's B) when he's walking to meet the child.
I think it's A) when he arranges to meet the child.
Well, go on, then!
- What?
D.
- Why?
How come?
Section 15 makes it an offence for a person aged 18 or over -
..or to travel with the intention of meeting a child...
DS Roper.
..the stumbling block to the offence in this question is the lack of previous communication.
Thanks.
He's here.
He has entered the building.
- Ooh, he's here.
- He's here!
- Boss, he's here.
- Right, excuse me.
- Who's here?
- The Chief Con.
Mr. Rutterford?
Look at you, all star struck.
Why's he here?
They're having a gold meeting.
Here?
Big enquiry like this, they just do.
It boosts morale allegedly and it looks good.
- Do we get to sit in on it?
- Of course you do, Kevin.
You and the strategic commanders.
We're going to go through to the briefing room, Andy.
Can you organise us some teas?
Thank you.
Ma'am.
A 48-year-old guy owns a sweet shop which he uses to further his paedophilic desires.
He sees a 12-year-old kid in the shop and has desires to touch him sexually.
- He arranges to -
- Put that away.
Get on with what you're supposed to be doing.
- Exam's tomorrow!
- I didn't get to bed last night, Kevin.
I didn't even get home.
Get on board.
Idiot.
- Mr. Rutterford.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Sir.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.
Thought we'd take it through to the briefing room.
Good, good.
The key to the whole thing, I think we all agree, is the fact that Dylan spent the entire day in the slot machine arcade on Silver Street.
He was in there for upwards of nine hours.
We've identified 47 people who went in there during those nine hours.
Gambling addicts, druggies, alcoholics, a convicted sex offender.
We've identified all 47 and we're in the process of speaking to all 47.
Can you talk me through his last known movements?
I can, yes.
The arcade manager, Michael Nash, locked up just after eight o'clock.
Dylan was hanging about outside the arcade with a little girl, Louise Armitage.
Nash knew Dylan, knew where he lived, offered to drive him home with Louise Armitage who lives four doors down from Dylan.
Nash dropped them both off on the corner at the end of their street, 8:20, we've got that on CCTV.
Louise went straight home, Dylan didn't.
Dylan said he was going to the chip shop.
Louise wanted to go with him but Dylan wouldn't let her.
Normally he will share.
We both do.
Depends who has the cash.
Why do you think he didn't want to this time, Louise?
I don't know.
Do you remember what he said?
'Bugger off, Louise.'
It was an excuse to get rid of her.
What we also know is that Dylan never went into the chip shop.
CCTV confirms that.
So he had plans other than going in the chip shop and he had to shake Louise off first.
At the minute, Louise is the last person we know spoke to him.
The last sighting is the CCTV from Netherfield Road that you've seen so much of on the news.
So he was walking away from his home and back towards Wynthenshawe.
So where he was going and who he was gonna meet is the $64 million question.
I am... convinced... it's someone he spoke to at that arcade, during those nine hours.
Obviously, you're... talking to this Michael Nash, the arcade manager?
Oh, are we talking to Michael Nash!
I've had him in twice with one of the tier threes.
She's downstairs again with him now.
I wish that I'd taken him to the door.
Both of them.
I would have normally... only he were insisting on going buying chips.
- So...
- Normally... ..what do you mean, 'normally', Michael?
Have you driven Dylan home before?
I know his mother.
The thing is, I know that he's not old enough to be in the arcade and I know that he should be in school... ..but I'd rather he was there where I could keep an eye on him.
And what about this registered sex offender?
Ryan Varney, 22 years old, small-time low-life dickhead.
Mental age of a banana.
Convicted of having sex with a 12-year-old girl five years ago.
We know he spent a lot of time with Dylan that day.
He took photos of him on his phone, messing about in the arcade, and he gave him money for pop and crisps.
I've had him in twice, as well, with another tier three and she's asked him back in today.
There's an eight-year-old boy missing... who, on the day that he went missing, you gave money to and you filmed on your phone.
In an arcade that he wasn't old enough to be in.
On a day that he was meant to be in school.
We've got half of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Force out looking for this kid.
It's really important, Ryan, that you try and tell me the truth.
Do you understand that?
And what're you thinking?
I'm thinking that out of the 120-plus people we've TIE-d, one of these two knows significantly more than they're telling us at the moment.
Nash was the last adult to speak to Dylan and Varney has this child sex offence.
Beyond that, it's an instinct.
I'm just unhappy about the pair of them.
And we're thinking the boy's dead?
Statistically, historically, yeah.
I've got 30 officers doing house-to-house.
I've got 20 dedicated search officers.
Based on advice from POLSA and CATCHEM, we're moving out in concentric half-mile circles from the point of the last sighting on Netherfield Road.
What I'd like to do, Gill...
Given the nature of the inquiry - this is no reflection on the job you're doing -
I'd like to bring the review team in sooner rather than later.
Think of it as a support, too, in this instance.
Is Mandy Saunders back off maternity, then?
No... no.
You'll be working with your ex-husband.
I assume you haven't got a problem with that?
No, sir.
Thanks for asking.
I'd rather he was there in the arcade where I know he's safe than wandering the streets which is what he'd do.
At least then I can say, hand on heart,
I was trying to keep an eye on him.
How long have you known Dawn, Michael?
Five or six months.
Is something the matter, only you seem a little bit embarrassed?
I...
OK, well, I've been seeing her.
Dawn.
You mean you've been having a relationship with her?
- Yeah.
- What sort of relationship?
A sexual relationship?
Yeah, yeah.
Sort of, yeah.
But, obviously, my wife doesn't know.
It's OK, Michael, we're not sat here judging you.
We just want to know where Dylan is and what's happened to him.
Sweet kid.
I just want to help her and be doing something for her.
OK.
I'd like to take you back to that Monday night again, if that's all right with you, Michael?
After you dropped Dylan off.
But, before I do, when you said just now, 'sweet kid,' who were you referring to?
Well, Dawn.
But, yeah, he's a sweet kid and all.
So what we know now, Ryan, is that when you told us that you went to McDonald's after you left the arcade... ..what we know now is that, in fact, you didn't.
Because we've got CCTV from inside and outside of McDonald's on Campbell Street... and you're not in there at all.
At any point during the evening.
Did I say the one on Campbell's Street, McDonald's?
Cos it might have been that other one.
By Tesco's.
I don't normally go in that other one but I do sometimes.
OK, but you told me... that when you ordered your meal, you went and sat on the left-hand-side by the window and, opposite, you could see people standing at a bus stop, yeah?
Do you remember telling me that?
Yeah.
Did I?
Well, you wouldn't have sat on the left-hand-side at the one near Tesco's, would you?
Because there's no seating down the left-hand-side when you're facing away from the counter.
And you couldn't have seen anybody stood at any bus stops, could you?
At the one near Tesco's?
Cos it's in, like, a... like a shopping, industrial estate type of area, isn't it?
All you'd have seen is a car park.
Yeah, yeah...
I must have been in that first one, then.
No, Ryan.
That's the point.
You weren't.
Yeah, well, I must have got me days... mixed up, then.
Right.
This Monday night, this last Monday night -
That is what I normally do do.
I come home from the arcade,
I go and have my tea in McDonald's.
Most days that is what I'm doing.
This Monday was different, wasn't it, because you didn't do that.
You didn't do what you normally do.
- What did you do, Ryan?
- Am I under arrest?
No.
So can I go, please?
Yeah.
Any time you like.
But I'd have thought that somebody in your position would have wanted us to help you...
..rule yourself out.
He said he was going to a house in Fallowfield, 11 Enfield Road.
He said he stayed there for four or five hours.
Which, when we got there, is all boarded up.
- The whole street is.
- Yeah, it's a druggie squat.
He gave us a few names, people he reckons he was there with.
Bash, Smiffey, Digsy - no real names but we're gonna follow it all up with the FIO.
So could he have taken Dylan there?
He could have done but...
We searched it thoroughly.
Cellar, attic.
If he was there, he's not there now.
How are we doing with Michael Nash?
Well, the plot thickens.
Turns out he's having a relationship with Dylan's mother.
I knew there was something he wasn't telling us.
- How long's he known her?
- Six months.
How did he meet her?
I didn't ask.
Do you want me to find out?
Yes, I do.
Right, tomorrow.
A) I won't be spending any more time with the press.
I'm handing it over.
It's ridiculous -
It's not ridiculous, it's necessary, but it's not an appropriate use of my time.
B) nothing to worry about - it's normal in an enquiry this high-profiled - but the review team's coming in.
Right, thank you.
Night-night.
Get some sleep.
Please remember, as you leave the building and beyond, the eyes of the media are on you 24/7.
Do not let yourself be photographed smiling or laughing, doing anything that could be misinterpreted because it will decimate the mother and these delightful people will have no compunction whatsoever, about showing it.
- Are you gonna get some sleep?
- Be nice, wouldn't it?
The parking's shit, apparently, outside the college.
So what do you want to do, drive over there together?
Save petrol and the hassle of trying to find more than one space.
I suppose we'd better get used to it anyway, you, driving me around, calling me 'Ma'am'.
I'm not gonna come round tonight.
I'm too tired.
Do you mind?
Something's not right.
I know, I can tell.
You're not committed to this.
I want to take it steady.
I don't want it assumed that I'll be round every night, especially when we're working silly hours.
You're right.
You're tired.
We're both tired.
We're all tired.
Yeah.
A job like this, it affects you.
Whether you like it or not, it just does.
Night-night.
Night.
Good night.
Right.
Ring me as soon as you can if... ..you know, if you want to.
Look, the point is... if the result isn't the one that you're wanting, you do get counselling straight away so...
..yeah, so - well, not that you'll need it, probably.
Hopefully, so.
That'll be Kev.
- Kev?
- Yeah.
Parking's a nightmare so...
I'm gonna leave my car here then we're gonna drive over to the college together at lunchtime.
Anyway, then I can go for a drink and not have to worry about...
In fact, why don't we all go for a drink after?
Yeah?
Hopefully, probably celebrating.
Yeah?
Yeah, good luck.
And you.
- Ring me.
- Yeah.
We'll deal with it.
- You don't have to come with me, Sean.
- I'm coming with you.
Alternatively, we could always leave mine here
- and go in your sexy little -
- Yeah, like that's happening.
That's Sean McCartney's car, that sad shitheap.
Is it?
- Are you and him?
- What?
- What?
- You know, I could...
When you were going with that flashy barrister,
I'm like, 'Fair enough.
Whatever.
'At least he's in her league,'
But, Jesus, Bailey, a road rat?
He's all right, is Sean.
Anyway, that flashy barrister turned out to be a complete cock, didn't he?
Chatterton Banana-Bending Factory, good morning.
We've got a body.
She's just rung me.
- She wants me at the scene.
- Where?
- Rusholme.
- Is it a kid?
- Is it him?
- Well, it's a kid.
Right, well, I will see you when I see you.
Look, if I don't see you before lunchtime, good luck.
If I can do it, you can do it - with knobs on.
Oh, and Kevin.
If you see Kevin, give him a kiss from me.
Right, yeah, will do.
Yeah, see you.
Was that Scotty?
The kid's body's turned up.
Is it him?
Good morning, DCI Murray, MIT.
I need to speak to the duty pathologist.
Can you ask whoever it is to ring me urgently?
Thanks.
On this number.
And can you flag up that we're going to need a paediatric pathologist as well as the Home Office one?
Thank you.
I want you to get on to Andy, house-to-house, starting with this street, that street, these streets along here.
Any CCTV in the vicinity going back to last Monday night.
I've seen a bus go along that road so let's find out the route, there might be more than one.
Get hold of any CCTV from any busses.
Mr. Welsh, good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
- I'm at the job on your division -
- Andy.
- I'm just confirm...
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm with her now.
- ..age, clothing, hair colour.
The body appears to be our boy.
Given the situation, we're already attracting onlookers.
I'm anticipating the press being here within minutes and I've not got a tent here to cover the body for another hour so what I'm planning to do is move the body sooner rather than later.
I don't even want to wait for the pathologist.
What I don't want is the mother to see the bin.
He's in a bin.
I don't want any vultures photographing the bin.
I seem to remember there are a couple of busses going along there, 36 and 157, there might be another one.
If there's -
- Janet!
- Hang on.
I need a van.
A van we can get a wheelie bin in upright and I need it now.
She says she wants a van now, right now.
One big to put wheelie bin in.
I think she's planning on moving the body before the vultures descend.
- ..
I will indeed.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- OK -
- Ta-ta...
- Speak later, bye.
Kid in a bin, eh?
I love this job, I love this job.
Do you know why?
Because I'm the one that gets to nail the bastard that did this to the wall by his fucking testicles.
Heather!
Good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
Can you put me through to Mr. Rutterford, please?
Mitch.
- Is it bad news?
- Hello, Mr. Nash.
- Have you found him?
- We've come to see Dawn.
Dawn!
- It's Mitch and another one.
- DC Bailey.
What are you doing here, Mr. Nash?
I'm a friend of the family.
- Have you found him?
- Where's your mum, Dawn?
She's...
Do you want to sit down for me?
Do you want to give Cheryl a call for me, Michael?
Do you want me to sit in with you, Dawn?
Can you give Cheryl a shout for me?
Cheryl!
- Dawn -
- You've found him!
- Haven't you?
- Have they found him?
Do you want to go in with Dawn, Mrs. Williams?
Why don't you go make some tea?
- She needs me with her.
- No, she's got her mother in there with her.
This is stupid, the way I'm being treated.
- I want to help her.
- This isn't about you, Michael.
So if you really care about Dawn, go and put the kettle on.
We think it is Dylan.
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Andy, Dirty Dave's rung him asking when you're available to brief the review team.
Any time this morning.
Are you gonna give me an answer or are you gonna make like an ostrich?
Yeah, that last one.
Tell him to tell him I'll be back in the office at half past and if he doesn't mind allowing me to kill two birds with one stone, he can join us for the briefing, all right?
Did you get that?
- Hello?
- Guess what?
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
I'm absolutely fucking brilliant!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey, Rachel, thanks for making me go.
It's not a problem.
- Rachel?
- What?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- See ya.
See ya.
Talk me through Michael Nash's alibi.
Nash dropped Dylan and Louise off at the end of their road at approximately 8:20pm.
Our last sighting of Dylan walking along Netherfield Road is at 8:45pm.
At 8:47, Nash is four miles away buying sweet-and-sour pork from a Chinese takeaway in Openshaw near to where he lives.
We've got the till roll.
The fellow remembers him.
He's a regular.
They had a conversation about wind turbines and solar panels.
Then, he says, he went home.
His wife and kids weren't there that night, they were visiting relatives in Sheffield but we know that he phoned her at 11pm or, at least, that a phone call was made from his house.
Whether he actually did go home before he made that phone call at 11pm, we don't know.
We found nothing to suggest otherwise but I'm not convinced.
Obviously, the onus is on us to prove he was elsewhere not him to prove he was at home.
Do you know, I'd really like to know where those takeaway cartons are.
If they're in his rubbish then we know he went straight home but if they're not then where are they?
Have you suspended his refuse collections?
I can do.
What time's the post-mortem?
Don't know, some time today, hopefully.
There's logistical issues.
You couldn't event trying to get a paediatric pathologist and our Home Office pathologist in the same city at the same time.
It will be interesting to know what's in the lad's stomach, eh?
Absolutely, it will.
What about Ryan Varney?
He's a better suspect.
He lied to us about where he was, he filmed the lad on a mobile phone, he gave him money.
His new alibi, which we're still looking at, puts him in a house less than 200 yards away from where Dylan's body turned up this morning.
He's got a previous conviction for an underage sex offence.
The other thing to say about Nash, of course, is that he's been messing about behind his wife's back.
With Dylan's mother, is the point.
- How long for?
- Six months.
- How did he meet her?
- Online.
Online dating.
Have you found his... online profile thing?
No, I didn't realise you wanted me to.
- Yes, please.
- Ma'am,
- is it all right if me and Kev get off?
- Yes, go!
- Good luck!
- Good luck!
- Go for it, you can do it.
- Sergeant's exam.
- Well, break a leg.
- Good luck, Kev.
Has anyone got a car, registration
Sierra-Lima-Zero-Eight-Romeo-Zebra Charlie?
Red CLS?
Yeah, it's mine.
Why?
Somebody's towing it away apparently.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
"Slob arse."
That's an interesting choice to spend money on for a personalised number plate, isn't it, Ma'am?
And I'm the best man in your life ever that you've ever had anything to do with ever.
You are definitely up there with the best of them, Sean, at this present moment in time.
So, what I was thinking was we need to stop messing about, you and me, and just get married.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
No, we are...you and me, destined to be together.
Why?
Why do we always end up in bed together, eh?
Even when we haven't seen each other for years.
I mean, this has been going on, on-and-off, since we were, what?
14?
It's meant to be.
It's just so obvious.
I'm surprised I'm having to spell it out.
I'm surprised we've not thought of it sooner.
I am never going to meet anyone more fantastic than you.
You are never going to meet anyone more fantastic than me.
Just think of the fantastic kids we'll be having.
You can't fight fate.
What do you want for your tea?
You see, a fellow like Sean - and I can see he can be amusing in a limited sort of way - he's just got no ambition.
- You need a fellow -
- Neither have you.
- I do.
- No, you don't.
You're a chancer.
You float along the line of least resistance.
Why am I doing this exam, then?
Why am I in MIT?
I know you all like to think I'm a knob but who gets into MIT being a knob?
Kevin, you're the exception that proves the rule.
That's why we love you.
Your sole function on this planet is to make the rest of us look good.
I saved your life a couple weeks ago!
Hello?
Yeah, it is, yeah.
What?
No, no, I'll be there.
I'm on my way.
- What's up?
- My brother's in hospital.
He's been involved in some sort of traffic accident.
- He's unconscious.
- You're kidding.
- I've gotta go.
- You're kidding!
What about the -
I need a taxi!
Alison?
Shit.
- I'll drive you.
- No, you won't.
Alison, Dom's been in an accident.
He's at hospital in Royal Oldham and he's unconscious.
That's as much as I know.
They've just rung me.
I'm gonna get round there now.
Shit.
Shit.
Fucking shit.
- I'll take you!
- No.
- I'm taking you.
- You're not missing it
- because of me.
- Don't be daft!
- Kevin!
- You'd do the same for me!
I wouldn't.
We're missing a trainer, boss.
It's probably in the bin contents.
Gill?
You're interested in the stomach content.
Have you come across that before?
Sweet and sour.
Sweet and sour, kiddy's stomach content.
Can you get someone to draft an order for arresting Michael Nash?
And let's get his rubbish collection suspended.
Will do.
See you.
Oh, my God.
His profile on this dating site!
'Single mothers welcome'.
The calling card of paedophiles everywhere.
He wasn't just grooming the kid, he's groomed the family.
Have you got any biscuits, Rach?
Usual place.
I will pay you back.
Like when you burnt my kitchen?
How are you going to pay me back, Dom?
You sell your arse a few more times?
I still owe £5,000 on that car.
You weren't insured, Dominic.
You've written her car off and you're made her miss her sergeant's exam.
Do you know?
Have you any idea?
Have you got the tiniest little inkling of how much that meant to her, eh?
Do you know how hard she's worked?
And you weren't even bloody-well unconscious for more than five seconds.
It isn't his fault that the hospital rung us.
I was just happy.
So you thought you'd go for a spin in somebody else's car?
What you gonna do?
Go back to work.
Tea.
Come on.
I'll drop you off at Oldham.
OK, let's go.
You guys stay here.
We'll go around the other side.
Michael, I've come to see Dawn.
Is she in?
Yeah.
Can I have a word with you, Mr. Nash, in another room?
- What for?
- Kitchen.
Dawn,
I've come here with some of my colleagues.
What's happening is they're just in the kitchen just now with Michael.
They're just arresting him.
- Mickey?
- Why would...
- Why are they...
- Mickey's not...
- Mickey wouldn't...
- Why are they arresting Mickey?
There are certain questions that we have to ask him.
Trust me, Dawn, and I know you and me have only known each other for four days... but trust me.
He does need to be under arrest.
Get off me!
Bastard!
All right.
All right.
All right.
It wasn't me, Dawn!
It wasn't me!
I wouldn't do that to Dylan!
Why would I do that to Dylan?
How did you get on?
Where's Kevin?
We have had some information, following a bit of joined-up thinking.
One of the cars spotted in the area where Dylan went missing, reported stolen two weeks previously, belongs to a Graham Sutherland.
- Yeah?
- So Sutherland is Michael Nash's brother-in-law.
Jesus!
So...
So he stole his brother-in-law's car two weeks ago.
This is so planned.
He grooms the family and then targets a car to pinch?
I missed my exam.
My brother was in an accident and I had to go to the hospital so I missed it.
Oh, my God!
Is he OK?
Yeah, he's fine.
Sorry.
I don't want to talk about it.
- Well, Rach -
- No, really.
Really.
More flowers?
Who are they from this time?
Same.
So, from the PM we know that Dylan was strangled.
The marks left on his neck suggest a belt just under an inch wide.
There's also the imprint of what may well be a buckle, here, like he's tethered with this thing round his neck.
We took a belt of Nash when we brought him in.
Good.
Well, let's see if we can get a match.
If we don't, we got POLSA turn his house inside out.
I think what he's done is... he's been to buy this Chinese.
He's driven home in his own car, picked up this other one - this one he's nicked - went back to meet Dylan somewhere - where?
- with his glutinous bright red sweet-and-sour pork.
I'm retrieving all the stuff from the bins round the back of the arcade.
I think that's a likely candidate for where he took him, lured him.
Then he did what he did to him and we're waiting now to see if we got any CCTV of that same stolen car going over to Fallowfield later that same night when - let's assume the same night
- Dylan was dumped.
Is someone interviewing Nash's wife?
- Oh, yeah.
- And Nash's solicitor's gone in with him, has he?
Ten minutes since.
I can confirm that this morning, a child's body was found in the Rusholme area of Manchester.
Dylan's mother, Dawn, subsequently identified her son's body.
This afternoon, a man was arrested.
The arrested man turned out to be Michael Nash who had presented himself as a friend of the family and who, earlier in the day, had made this impassioned please.
We just ask that Dawn be left alone in peace so that she can try...
- Hello?
- Mum, it's gonna be another late one.
- That's all right, love.
- Are the girls all right?
Yes, Tasie made burgers at school and we've had them for our tea.
I had to add a few onions and mushrooms.
Oh, and a bit of tomato puree!
But she did very well.
It was very tasty.
Anyway, you've caught him!
Yeah, we think we have.
We've made an arrest.
I suppose you'll have a lot of paperwork to do.
Who'll be actually interviewing him, then?
Gill?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Does the name Adam Hoyle mean anything to you, Michael?
I didn't do it.
Have you ever used another name?
Following your appearance on the news this evening when you made a statement on behalf of the family outside Dawn's house, we've received a number of calls identifying you as Patrick David Whitmore.
Well, you see, things like that... come back to haunt you.
Mud sticks.
Are you Patrick David Whitmore?
Yeah, I changed my name.
I had to.
Why did you chance your name, Michael?
Why did he go on the news like that?
He must have known people would recognise him.
They do.
They're thick.
They can't help it.
They like to put themselves at the heart of the investigation.
Look at Ian Huntley, it's a compulsion.
They're sick.
He'd get such a buzz talking to the press like that this afternoon.
That man, that gibbering, sorry, apologetic wreck... ..is one of the most calculating, cynical, evil human beings you'll ever look at.
11 counts of sexual assault.
Yeah, I was convicted of none of them.
But mud sticks.
And he still trying to damage me with it now.
Not him.
He didn't ring in.
It was his sister.
Adam Hoyle took his own life eight years ago right after you walked free from court.
Well, he brought it on himself.
I never touched him.
He lied.
He lied and he lied.
Yeah, but he was obviously sick in the head.
Hey, how was your exam?
I'm going to have to re-sit it next year.
My brother had an accident.
I missed it.
Is he... all right?
Yes, thank you.
He's fine.
I didn't do it.
We found a car, a blue Ford Fiesta, registered to your brother-in-law, Graham Sutherland.
He reported it stolen two weeks ago.
In it, in the boot... we found a trainer stuck down the side by the door.
It matches a trainer that we found on Dylan's body this morning when we removed him from the bin that he'd been left in.
Also in the car, we found takeaway containers.
In them were the remnants of sweet-and-sour pork.
What can you tell me about that, Michael?
Didn't do it.
We've identified a mark on Dylan's neck as being made by a belt buckle.
The mark is very similar to the buckle on your belt, the belt that we removed from you when you arrived here this evening.
What would your response be to that, Michael?
I didn't do it.
What we think happened, Michael - correct me if I'm wrong -
is that you tethered Dylan with the belt while you sexually assaulted him.
Did I mention that we found semen?
Is that going to turn out to be yours, Michael?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm not stopping.
- OK.
Not even for a drink.
- OK.
- Sorry.
It's fine.
I don't want to do this any more.
What?
I nearly went straight home and rang you but I can't.
I don't want to let you go on thinking that this is happening when it isn't.
I've tried and it isn't what I want.
I'm sorry.
I...
I said to Rach when I split up with Adrian that I didn't want to walk out of one relationship straight into another and that's exactly what I've done.
You spoke to Rachel about Adrian?
You told me you hadn't told anyone at work.
You said I was the only one that knew.
Yeah, well...
I tell Rach stuff.
Why?
She's an airhead.
She's my best friend and she's not an airhead.
She's very far from being an airhead.
- She fucked up her exam.
- She did not fuck up her exam.
I thought I was your best friend?
Obviously not.
So... ..that's it then, is it?
Just like that?
Why?
Time, space.
All the things I've talked about.
All the things that I've never made a secret of.
I hope
- I hope, we're friends but I can't...
I'm going now.
- Hello.
- You evil, pathetic, nasty, little shitbag.
What was his name, Andy?
Were you?
Having a fling with him?
No.
Does the Assistant Chief Con know you had your car repossessed?
You're not hard up, are you?
He had no enemies!
This was about the colour of his skin!
Andy, we're starting to talk about harassment.
Sean, he's asked me to be his best man.
- What?
- At this wedding.
- What wedding?
- Yours!

Sling your hook.
- Fair enough.
- Is there someone else?
- No.
Have you got time for a drink or...
I don't know what you had to do, Dom, in prison to get by.
That is in the past.
You're in my world now.

I'd better go.
Andy.
- Come on.
- No.
Please, come on.
It's nearly midnight.
I've got to get home.
Have you thought any more about telling the girls?
I can't, not at the minute.
Not with a job like this one.
I hardly see them as it is, never mind -
Why don't we try and organise a Sunday off together and take them for a meal and tell them?
- Together, and Dorothy.
- Yeah... just not now.
- Not with this job like it is.
- Obviously not now.
I mean, in a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- You don't sound too convinced.
- I'm tired.
- Is everything OK?
- It's fine.
- I'm still a bit -
- What?
Bothered... about why you didn't tell me you and Ade had split up.
Are you going to keep picking at this?
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.
- I'm just -
- You are.
I didn't want to talk about it.
I didn't want people coming up to me saying,
'Oh, I'm sorry to hear about you and Ade.'
I wanted time to think about things.
Properly.
Yeah, but...
I'm not on about 'people'.
I'm on about me.
- Janet.
- Don't... analyse things to death.
Detectives in Greater Manchester are continuing the search for the missing schoolboy,
Dylan Nichols.
Following Dawn Nichols' plea yesterday for information on her eight-year-old son's whereabouts,
Manchester Police's Major Incident Team have recieved hundreds of calls with alleged sightings of Dylan in Amsterdam and Barcelona.
We want him home.
We just want him home.
Friends, relatives and neighbours have joined a team
- of more than 100 -
- Look, look, there's me.
- ..in the search for Dylan...
- Where?
..who was last seen four days ago.
Hello?
Yeah, it is, yeah.
Tomorrow morning?
What time?
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Yeah, that's fine.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Nine o'clock?
Thank you.
All right, bye-bye-bye.
What?
Dom's gotta have an HIV test.
That was the clinic.
I've booked him an appointment for three weeks but they've had a cancellation and they can see him tomorrow at nine.
You couldn't go with him for me, could you?
I've got my exam, my sergeant's exam is twelve.
You're on three elevens.
Look, if someone doesn't go with him then he's not going to turn up.
And...
I've taken three hours out of the exam.
I don't want to ask Godzilla if I can have the whole morning off.
Not in the middle of this.
Why's he got to have an HIV test?
Course I will.
Course I will.
Course I'll go with him.
Is it:
A) when he arranges to meet the child?
B) when he starts walking to meet the child?
C) when he first meets the child in the park?
D) he does not commit the offence as he has not previously communicated with the child?
I think it's B) when he's walking to meet the child.
I think it's A) when he arranges to meet the child.
Well, go on, then!
- What?
D.
- Why?
How come?
Section 15 makes it an offence for a person aged 18 or over -
..or to travel with the intention of meeting a child...
DS Roper.
..the stumbling block to the offence in this question is the lack of previous communication.
Thanks.
He's here.
He has entered the building.
- Ooh, he's here.
- He's here!
- Boss, he's here.
- Right, excuse me.
- Who's here?
- The Chief Con.
Mr. Rutterford?
Look at you, all star struck.
Why's he here?
They're having a gold meeting.
Here?
Big enquiry like this, they just do.
It boosts morale allegedly and it looks good.
- Do we get to sit in on it?
- Of course you do, Kevin.
You and the strategic commanders.
We're going to go through to the briefing room, Andy.
Can you organise us some teas?
Thank you.
Ma'am.
A 48-year-old guy owns a sweet shop which he uses to further his paedophilic desires.
He sees a 12-year-old kid in the shop and has desires to touch him sexually.
- He arranges to -
- Put that away.
Get on with what you're supposed to be doing.
- Exam's tomorrow!
- I didn't get to bed last night, Kevin.
I didn't even get home.
Get on board.
Idiot.
- Mr. Rutterford.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Sir.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.
Thought we'd take it through to the briefing room.
Good, good.
The key to the whole thing, I think we all agree, is the fact that Dylan spent the entire day in the slot machine arcade on Silver Street.
He was in there for upwards of nine hours.
We've identified 47 people who went in there during those nine hours.
Gambling addicts, druggies, alcoholics, a convicted sex offender.
We've identified all 47 and we're in the process of speaking to all 47.
Can you talk me through his last known movements?
I can, yes.
The arcade manager, Michael Nash, locked up just after eight o'clock.
Dylan was hanging about outside the arcade with a little girl, Louise Armitage.
Nash knew Dylan, knew where he lived, offered to drive him home with Louise Armitage who lives four doors down from Dylan.
Nash dropped them both off on the corner at the end of their street, 8:20, we've got that on CCTV.
Louise went straight home, Dylan didn't.
Dylan said he was going to the chip shop.
Louise wanted to go with him but Dylan wouldn't let her.
Normally he will share.
We both do.
Depends who has the cash.
Why do you think he didn't want to this time, Louise?
I don't know.
Do you remember what he said?
'Bugger off, Louise.'
It was an excuse to get rid of her.
What we also know is that Dylan never went into the chip shop.
CCTV confirms that.
So he had plans other than going in the chip shop and he had to shake Louise off first.
At the minute, Louise is the last person we know spoke to him.
The last sighting is the CCTV from Netherfield Road that you've seen so much of on the news.
So he was walking away from his home and back towards Wynthenshawe.
So where he was going and who he was gonna meet is the $64 million question.
I am... convinced... it's someone he spoke to at that arcade, during those nine hours.
Obviously, you're... talking to this Michael Nash, the arcade manager?
Oh, are we talking to Michael Nash!
I've had him in twice with one of the tier threes.
She's downstairs again with him now.
I wish that I'd taken him to the door.
Both of them.
I would have normally... only he were insisting on going buying chips.
- So...
- Normally... ..what do you mean, 'normally', Michael?
Have you driven Dylan home before?
I know his mother.
The thing is, I know that he's not old enough to be in the arcade and I know that he should be in school... ..but I'd rather he was there where I could keep an eye on him.
And what about this registered sex offender?
Ryan Varney, 22 years old, small-time low-life dickhead.
Mental age of a banana.
Convicted of having sex with a 12-year-old girl five years ago.
We know he spent a lot of time with Dylan that day.
He took photos of him on his phone, messing about in the arcade, and he gave him money for pop and crisps.
I've had him in twice, as well, with another tier three and she's asked him back in today.
There's an eight-year-old boy missing... who, on the day that he went missing, you gave money to and you filmed on your phone.
In an arcade that he wasn't old enough to be in.
On a day that he was meant to be in school.
We've got half of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Force out looking for this kid.
It's really important, Ryan, that you try and tell me the truth.
Do you understand that?
And what're you thinking?
I'm thinking that out of the 120-plus people we've TIE-d, one of these two knows significantly more than they're telling us at the moment.
Nash was the last adult to speak to Dylan and Varney has this child sex offence.
Beyond that, it's an instinct.
I'm just unhappy about the pair of them.
And we're thinking the boy's dead?
Statistically, historically, yeah.
I've got 30 officers doing house-to-house.
I've got 20 dedicated search officers.
Based on advice from POLSA and CATCHEM, we're moving out in concentric half-mile circles from the point of the last sighting on Netherfield Road.
What I'd like to do, Gill...
Given the nature of the inquiry - this is no reflection on the job you're doing -
I'd like to bring the review team in sooner rather than later.
Think of it as a support, too, in this instance.
Is Mandy Saunders back off maternity, then?
No... no.
You'll be working with your ex-husband.
I assume you haven't got a problem with that?
No, sir.
Thanks for asking.
I'd rather he was there in the arcade where I know he's safe than wandering the streets which is what he'd do.
At least then I can say, hand on heart,
I was trying to keep an eye on him.
How long have you known Dawn, Michael?
Five or six months.
Is something the matter, only you seem a little bit embarrassed?
I...
OK, well, I've been seeing her.
Dawn.
You mean you've been having a relationship with her?
- Yeah.
- What sort of relationship?
A sexual relationship?
Yeah, yeah.
Sort of, yeah.
But, obviously, my wife doesn't know.
It's OK, Michael, we're not sat here judging you.
We just want to know where Dylan is and what's happened to him.
Sweet kid.
I just want to help her and be doing something for her.
OK.
I'd like to take you back to that Monday night again, if that's all right with you, Michael?
After you dropped Dylan off.
But, before I do, when you said just now, 'sweet kid,' who were you referring to?
Well, Dawn.
But, yeah, he's a sweet kid and all.
So what we know now, Ryan, is that when you told us that you went to McDonald's after you left the arcade... ..what we know now is that, in fact, you didn't.
Because we've got CCTV from inside and outside of McDonald's on Campbell Street... and you're not in there at all.
At any point during the evening.
Did I say the one on Campbell's Street, McDonald's?
Cos it might have been that other one.
By Tesco's.
I don't normally go in that other one but I do sometimes.
OK, but you told me... that when you ordered your meal, you went and sat on the left-hand-side by the window and, opposite, you could see people standing at a bus stop, yeah?
Do you remember telling me that?
Yeah.
Did I?
Well, you wouldn't have sat on the left-hand-side at the one near Tesco's, would you?
Because there's no seating down the left-hand-side when you're facing away from the counter.
And you couldn't have seen anybody stood at any bus stops, could you?
At the one near Tesco's?
Cos it's in, like, a... like a shopping, industrial estate type of area, isn't it?
All you'd have seen is a car park.
Yeah, yeah...
I must have been in that first one, then.
No, Ryan.
That's the point.
You weren't.
Yeah, well, I must have got me days... mixed up, then.
Right.
This Monday night, this last Monday night -
That is what I normally do do.
I come home from the arcade,
I go and have my tea in McDonald's.
Most days that is what I'm doing.
This Monday was different, wasn't it, because you didn't do that.
You didn't do what you normally do.
- What did you do, Ryan?
- Am I under arrest?
No.
So can I go, please?
Yeah.
Any time you like.
But I'd have thought that somebody in your position would have wanted us to help you...
..rule yourself out.
He said he was going to a house in Fallowfield, 11 Enfield Road.
He said he stayed there for four or five hours.
Which, when we got there, is all boarded up.
- The whole street is.
- Yeah, it's a druggie squat.
He gave us a few names, people he reckons he was there with.
Bash, Smiffey, Digsy - no real names but we're gonna follow it all up with the FIO.
So could he have taken Dylan there?
He could have done but...
We searched it thoroughly.
Cellar, attic.
If he was there, he's not there now.
How are we doing with Michael Nash?
Well, the plot thickens.
Turns out he's having a relationship with Dylan's mother.
I knew there was something he wasn't telling us.
- How long's he known her?
- Six months.
How did he meet her?
I didn't ask.
Do you want me to find out?
Yes, I do.
Right, tomorrow.
A) I won't be spending any more time with the press.
I'm handing it over.
It's ridiculous -
It's not ridiculous, it's necessary, but it's not an appropriate use of my time.
B) nothing to worry about - it's normal in an enquiry this high-profiled - but the review team's coming in.
Right, thank you.
Night-night.
Get some sleep.
Please remember, as you leave the building and beyond, the eyes of the media are on you 24/7.
Do not let yourself be photographed smiling or laughing, doing anything that could be misinterpreted because it will decimate the mother and these delightful people will have no compunction whatsoever, about showing it.
- Are you gonna get some sleep?
- Be nice, wouldn't it?
The parking's shit, apparently, outside the college.
So what do you want to do, drive over there together?
Save petrol and the hassle of trying to find more than one space.
I suppose we'd better get used to it anyway, you, driving me around, calling me 'Ma'am'.
I'm not gonna come round tonight.
I'm too tired.
Do you mind?
Something's not right.
I know, I can tell.
You're not committed to this.
I want to take it steady.
I don't want it assumed that I'll be round every night, especially when we're working silly hours.
You're right.
You're tired.
We're both tired.
We're all tired.
Yeah.
A job like this, it affects you.
Whether you like it or not, it just does.
Night-night.
Night.
Good night.
Right.
Ring me as soon as you can if... ..you know, if you want to.
Look, the point is... if the result isn't the one that you're wanting, you do get counselling straight away so...
..yeah, so - well, not that you'll need it, probably.
Hopefully, so.
That'll be Kev.
- Kev?
- Yeah.
Parking's a nightmare so...
I'm gonna leave my car here then we're gonna drive over to the college together at lunchtime.
Anyway, then I can go for a drink and not have to worry about...
In fact, why don't we all go for a drink after?
Yeah?
Hopefully, probably celebrating.
Yeah?
Yeah, good luck.
And you.
- Ring me.
- Yeah.
We'll deal with it.
- You don't have to come with me, Sean.
- I'm coming with you.
Alternatively, we could always leave mine here
- and go in your sexy little -
- Yeah, like that's happening.
That's Sean McCartney's car, that sad shitheap.
Is it?
- Are you and him?
- What?
- What?
- You know, I could...
When you were going with that flashy barrister,
I'm like, 'Fair enough.
Whatever.
'At least he's in her league,'
But, Jesus, Bailey, a road rat?
He's all right, is Sean.
Anyway, that flashy barrister turned out to be a complete cock, didn't he?
Chatterton Banana-Bending Factory, good morning.
We've got a body.
She's just rung me.
- She wants me at the scene.
- Where?
- Rusholme.
- Is it a kid?
- Is it him?
- Well, it's a kid.
Right, well, I will see you when I see you.
Look, if I don't see you before lunchtime, good luck.
If I can do it, you can do it - with knobs on.
Oh, and Kevin.
If you see Kevin, give him a kiss from me.
Right, yeah, will do.
Yeah, see you.
Was that Scotty?
The kid's body's turned up.
Is it him?
Good morning, DCI Murray, MIT.
I need to speak to the duty pathologist.
Can you ask whoever it is to ring me urgently?
Thanks.
On this number.
And can you flag up that we're going to need a paediatric pathologist as well as the Home Office one?
Thank you.
I want you to get on to Andy, house-to-house, starting with this street, that street, these streets along here.
Any CCTV in the vicinity going back to last Monday night.
I've seen a bus go along that road so let's find out the route, there might be more than one.
Get hold of any CCTV from any busses.
Mr. Welsh, good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
- I'm at the job on your division -
- Andy.
- I'm just confirm...
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm with her now.
- ..age, clothing, hair colour.
The body appears to be our boy.
Given the situation, we're already attracting onlookers.
I'm anticipating the press being here within minutes and I've not got a tent here to cover the body for another hour so what I'm planning to do is move the body sooner rather than later.
I don't even want to wait for the pathologist.
What I don't want is the mother to see the bin.
He's in a bin.
I don't want any vultures photographing the bin.
I seem to remember there are a couple of busses going along there, 36 and 157, there might be another one.
If there's -
- Janet!
- Hang on.
I need a van.
A van we can get a wheelie bin in upright and I need it now.
She says she wants a van now, right now.
One big to put wheelie bin in.
I think she's planning on moving the body before the vultures descend.
- ..
I will indeed.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- OK -
- Ta-ta...
- Speak later, bye.
Kid in a bin, eh?
I love this job, I love this job.
Do you know why?
Because I'm the one that gets to nail the bastard that did this to the wall by his fucking testicles.
Heather!
Good morning.
DCI Murray, MIT.
Can you put me through to Mr. Rutterford, please?
Mitch.
- Is it bad news?
- Hello, Mr. Nash.
- Have you found him?
- We've come to see Dawn.
Dawn!
- It's Mitch and another one.
- DC Bailey.
What are you doing here, Mr. Nash?
I'm a friend of the family.
- Have you found him?
- Where's your mum, Dawn?
She's...
Do you want to sit down for me?
Do you want to give Cheryl a call for me, Michael?
Do you want me to sit in with you, Dawn?
Can you give Cheryl a shout for me?
Cheryl!
- Dawn -
- You've found him!
- Haven't you?
- Have they found him?
Do you want to go in with Dawn, Mrs. Williams?
Why don't you go make some tea?
- She needs me with her.
- No, she's got her mother in there with her.
This is stupid, the way I'm being treated.
- I want to help her.
- This isn't about you, Michael.
So if you really care about Dawn, go and put the kettle on.
We think it is Dylan.
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Andy, Dirty Dave's rung him asking when you're available to brief the review team.
Any time this morning.
Are you gonna give me an answer or are you gonna make like an ostrich?
Yeah, that last one.
Tell him to tell him I'll be back in the office at half past and if he doesn't mind allowing me to kill two birds with one stone, he can join us for the briefing, all right?
Did you get that?
- Hello?
- Guess what?
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
I'm absolutely fucking brilliant!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey, Rachel, thanks for making me go.
It's not a problem.
- Rachel?
- What?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- See ya.
See ya.
Talk me through Michael Nash's alibi.
Nash dropped Dylan and Louise off at the end of their road at approximately 8:20pm.
Our last sighting of Dylan walking along Netherfield Road is at 8:45pm.
At 8:47, Nash is four miles away buying sweet-and-sour pork from a Chinese takeaway in Openshaw near to where he lives.
We've got the till roll.
The fellow remembers him.
He's a regular.
They had a conversation about wind turbines and solar panels.
Then, he says, he went home.
His wife and kids weren't there that night, they were visiting relatives in Sheffield but we know that he phoned her at 11pm or, at least, that a phone call was made from his house.
Whether he actually did go home before he made that phone call at 11pm, we don't know.
We found nothing to suggest otherwise but I'm not convinced.
Obviously, the onus is on us to prove he was elsewhere not him to prove he was at home.
Do you know, I'd really like to know where those takeaway cartons are.
If they're in his rubbish then we know he went straight home but if they're not then where are they?
Have you suspended his refuse collections?
I can do.
What time's the post-mortem?
Don't know, some time today, hopefully.
There's logistical issues.
You couldn't event trying to get a paediatric pathologist and our Home Office pathologist in the same city at the same time.
It will be interesting to know what's in the lad's stomach, eh?
Absolutely, it will.
What about Ryan Varney?
He's a better suspect.
He lied to us about where he was, he filmed the lad on a mobile phone, he gave him money.
His new alibi, which we're still looking at, puts him in a house less than 200 yards away from where Dylan's body turned up this morning.
He's got a previous conviction for an underage sex offence.
The other thing to say about Nash, of course, is that he's been messing about behind his wife's back.
With Dylan's mother, is the point.
- How long for?
- Six months.
- How did he meet her?
- Online.
Online dating.
Have you found his... online profile thing?
No, I didn't realise you wanted me to.
- Yes, please.
- Ma'am,
- is it all right if me and Kev get off?
- Yes, go!
- Good luck!
- Good luck!
- Go for it, you can do it.
- Sergeant's exam.
- Well, break a leg.
- Good luck, Kev.
Has anyone got a car, registration
Sierra-Lima-Zero-Eight-Romeo-Zebra Charlie?
Red CLS?
Yeah, it's mine.
Why?
Somebody's towing it away apparently.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
"Slob arse."
That's an interesting choice to spend money on for a personalised number plate, isn't it, Ma'am?
And I'm the best man in your life ever that you've ever had anything to do with ever.
You are definitely up there with the best of them, Sean, at this present moment in time.
So, what I was thinking was we need to stop messing about, you and me, and just get married.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
No, we are...you and me, destined to be together.
Why?
Why do we always end up in bed together, eh?
Even when we haven't seen each other for years.
I mean, this has been going on, on-and-off, since we were, what?
14?
It's meant to be.
It's just so obvious.
I'm surprised I'm having to spell it out.
I'm surprised we've not thought of it sooner.
I am never going to meet anyone more fantastic than you.
You are never going to meet anyone more fantastic than me.
Just think of the fantastic kids we'll be having.
You can't fight fate.
What do you want for your tea?
You see, a fellow like Sean - and I can see he can be amusing in a limited sort of way - he's just got no ambition.
- You need a fellow -
- Neither have you.
- I do.
- No, you don't.
You're a chancer.
You float along the line of least resistance.
Why am I doing this exam, then?
Why am I in MIT?
I know you all like to think I'm a knob but who gets into MIT being a knob?
Kevin, you're the exception that proves the rule.
That's why we love you.
Your sole function on this planet is to make the rest of us look good.
I saved your life a couple weeks ago!
Hello?
Yeah, it is, yeah.
What?
No, no, I'll be there.
I'm on my way.
- What's up?
- My brother's in hospital.
He's been involved in some sort of traffic accident.
- He's unconscious.
- You're kidding.
- I've gotta go.
- You're kidding!
What about the -
I need a taxi!
Alison?
Shit.
- I'll drive you.
- No, you won't.
Alison, Dom's been in an accident.
He's at hospital in Royal Oldham and he's unconscious.
That's as much as I know.
They've just rung me.
I'm gonna get round there now.
Shit.
Shit.
Fucking shit.
- I'll take you!
- No.
- I'm taking you.
- You're not missing it
- because of me.
- Don't be daft!
- Kevin!
- You'd do the same for me!
I wouldn't.
We're missing a trainer, boss.
It's probably in the bin contents.
Gill?
You're interested in the stomach content.
Have you come across that before?
Sweet and sour.
Sweet and sour, kiddy's stomach content.
Can you get someone to draft an order for arresting Michael Nash?
And let's get his rubbish collection suspended.
Will do.
See you.
Oh, my God.
His profile on this dating site!
'Single mothers welcome'.
The calling card of paedophiles everywhere.
He wasn't just grooming the kid, he's groomed the family.
Have you got any biscuits, Rach?
Usual place.
I will pay you back.
Like when you burnt my kitchen?
How are you going to pay me back, Dom?
You sell your arse a few more times?
I still owe £5,000 on that car.
You weren't insured, Dominic.
You've written her car off and you're made her miss her sergeant's exam.
Do you know?
Have you any idea?
Have you got the tiniest little inkling of how much that meant to her, eh?
Do you know how hard she's worked?
And you weren't even bloody-well unconscious for more than five seconds.
It isn't his fault that the hospital rung us.
I was just happy.
So you thought you'd go for a spin in somebody else's car?
What you gonna do?
Go back to work.
Tea.
Come on.
I'll drop you off at Oldham.
OK, let's go.
You guys stay here.
We'll go around the other side.
Michael, I've come to see Dawn.
Is she in?
Yeah.
Can I have a word with you, Mr. Nash, in another room?
- What for?
- Kitchen.
Dawn,
I've come here with some of my colleagues.
What's happening is they're just in the kitchen just now with Michael.
They're just arresting him.
- Mickey?
- Why would...
- Why are they...
- Mickey's not...
- Mickey wouldn't...
- Why are they arresting Mickey?
There are certain questions that we have to ask him.
Trust me, Dawn, and I know you and me have only known each other for four days... but trust me.
He does need to be under arrest.
Get off me!
Bastard!
All right.
All right.
All right.
It wasn't me, Dawn!
It wasn't me!
I wouldn't do that to Dylan!
Why would I do that to Dylan?
How did you get on?
Where's Kevin?
We have had some information, following a bit of joined-up thinking.
One of the cars spotted in the area where Dylan went missing, reported stolen two weeks previously, belongs to a Graham Sutherland.
- Yeah?
- So Sutherland is Michael Nash's brother-in-law.
Jesus!
So...
So he stole his brother-in-law's car two weeks ago.
This is so planned.
He grooms the family and then targets a car to pinch?
I missed my exam.
My brother was in an accident and I had to go to the hospital so I missed it.
Oh, my God!
Is he OK?
Yeah, he's fine.
Sorry.
I don't want to talk about it.
- Well, Rach -
- No, really.
Really.
More flowers?
Who are they from this time?
Same.
So, from the PM we know that Dylan was strangled.
The marks left on his neck suggest a belt just under an inch wide.
There's also the imprint of what may well be a buckle, here, like he's tethered with this thing round his neck.
We took a belt of Nash when we brought him in.
Good.
Well, let's see if we can get a match.
If we don't, we got POLSA turn his house inside out.
I think what he's done is... he's been to buy this Chinese.
He's driven home in his own car, picked up this other one - this one he's nicked - went back to meet Dylan somewhere - where?
- with his glutinous bright red sweet-and-sour pork.
I'm retrieving all the stuff from the bins round the back of the arcade.
I think that's a likely candidate for where he took him, lured him.
Then he did what he did to him and we're waiting now to see if we got any CCTV of that same stolen car going over to Fallowfield later that same night when - let's assume the same night
- Dylan was dumped.
Is someone interviewing Nash's wife?
- Oh, yeah.
- And Nash's solicitor's gone in with him, has he?
Ten minutes since.
I can confirm that this morning, a child's body was found in the Rusholme area of Manchester.
Dylan's mother, Dawn, subsequently identified her son's body.
This afternoon, a man was arrested.
The arrested man turned out to be Michael Nash who had presented himself as a friend of the family and who, earlier in the day, had made this impassioned please.
We just ask that Dawn be left alone in peace so that she can try...
- Hello?
- Mum, it's gonna be another late one.
- That's all right, love.
- Are the girls all right?
Yes, Tasie made burgers at school and we've had them for our tea.
I had to add a few onions and mushrooms.
Oh, and a bit of tomato puree!
But she did very well.
It was very tasty.
Anyway, you've caught him!
Yeah, we think we have.
We've made an arrest.
I suppose you'll have a lot of paperwork to do.
Who'll be actually interviewing him, then?
Gill?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Does the name Adam Hoyle mean anything to you, Michael?
I didn't do it.
Have you ever used another name?
Following your appearance on the news this evening when you made a statement on behalf of the family outside Dawn's house, we've received a number of calls identifying you as Patrick David Whitmore.
Well, you see, things like that... come back to haunt you.
Mud sticks.
Are you Patrick David Whitmore?
Yeah, I changed my name.
I had to.
Why did you chance your name, Michael?
Why did he go on the news like that?
He must have known people would recognise him.
They do.
They're thick.
They can't help it.
They like to put themselves at the heart of the investigation.
Look at Ian Huntley, it's a compulsion.
They're sick.
He'd get such a buzz talking to the press like that this afternoon.
That man, that gibbering, sorry, apologetic wreck... ..is one of the most calculating, cynical, evil human beings you'll ever look at.
11 counts of sexual assault.
Yeah, I was convicted of none of them.
But mud sticks.
And he still trying to damage me with it now.
Not him.
He didn't ring in.
It was his sister.
Adam Hoyle took his own life eight years ago right after you walked free from court.
Well, he brought it on himself.
I never touched him.
He lied.
He lied and he lied.
Yeah, but he was obviously sick in the head.
Hey, how was your exam?
I'm going to have to re-sit it next year.
My brother had an accident.
I missed it.
Is he... all right?
Yes, thank you.
He's fine.
I didn't do it.
We found a car, a blue Ford Fiesta, registered to your brother-in-law, Graham Sutherland.
He reported it stolen two weeks ago.
In it, in the boot... we found a trainer stuck down the side by the door.
It matches a trainer that we found on Dylan's body this morning when we removed him from the bin that he'd been left in.
Also in the car, we found takeaway containers.
In them were the remnants of sweet-and-sour pork.
What can you tell me about that, Michael?
Didn't do it.
We've identified a mark on Dylan's neck as being made by a belt buckle.
The mark is very similar to the buckle on your belt, the belt that we removed from you when you arrived here this evening.
What would your response be to that, Michael?
I didn't do it.
What we think happened, Michael - correct me if I'm wrong -
is that you tethered Dylan with the belt while you sexually assaulted him.
Did I mention that we found semen?
Is that going to turn out to be yours, Michael?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm not stopping.
- OK.
Not even for a drink.
- OK.
- Sorry.
It's fine.
I don't want to do this any more.
What?
I nearly went straight home and rang you but I can't.
I don't want to let you go on thinking that this is happening when it isn't.
I've tried and it isn't what I want.
I'm sorry.
I...
I said to Rach when I split up with Adrian that I didn't want to walk out of one relationship straight into another and that's exactly what I've done.
You spoke to Rachel about Adrian?
You told me you hadn't told anyone at work.
You said I was the only one that knew.
Yeah, well...
I tell Rach stuff.
Why?
She's an airhead.
She's my best friend and she's not an airhead.
She's very far from being an airhead.
- She fucked up her exam.
- She did not fuck up her exam.
I thought I was your best friend?
Obviously not.
So... ..that's it then, is it?
Just like that?
Why?
Time, space.
All the things I've talked about.
All the things that I've never made a secret of.
I hope
- I hope, we're friends but I can't...
I'm going now.
- Hello.
- You evil, pathetic, nasty, little shitbag.
What was his name, Andy?
Were you?
Having a fling with him?
No.
Does the Assistant Chief Con know you had your car repossessed?
You're not hard up, are you?
He had no enemies!
This was about the colour of his skin!
Andy, we're starting to talk about harassment.
Sean, he's asked me to be his best man.
- What?
- At this wedding.
- What wedding?
- Yours!

I haven't talked to him since he got hurt.
Lieutenant Anderson is here because his face got burned in Afghanistan.
This is Lieutenant Anderson.
Welcome to our house, sir.
Thanks, finn.
Come on in.
Captain Nicole Galassini-- She's up for a Purple Heart.
And you recommend Bronze Star with "V" device for valor?
I do, sir.
Her actions in the face of armed opposition allowed us to evacuate those American citizens without bloodshed, sir.
You don't have tell me, Frank.
She's the genuine article, all right.
To my Bronze Star winner.
Face it, girl.
You are a hell of a soldier.
Here's to you.
To us.
(Clinks)
(Voice breaks) Will you marry me?
Yes. (Laughs)
Yes, I will.
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't know her.
(Crying) Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Gloria.
- Just get out.
- Let's just talk about it, please.
- Just get out.
Just get out.
Just get out!
- Let's talk about it.
Please!
I don't want to see you!
Never!
Go!
(Crying)
I just got a text from TJ.
His class is going to the Lincoln Memorial today, and then to the Air and Space museum.
I want to go to the Air and Space museum.
You will someday, buddy.
How's the hand this morning?
Uh... the swelling's gone down some.
Yeah, I'm not gonna be throwing any more breaking curveballs, but...
You don't know that.
They can do a lot with rehab these days, right?
Can you hear out of your bad ear?
(Roxy) Finn, don't be rude.
Dad asked about his hand.
It's okay.
Um, yes, I can hear out of it.
It's just not so pretty to look at.
Cool.
Okay, you got your answer, mister.
Go get your backpack.
Sorry.
Don't be.
It's always the same.
People can't look or can't look away.
Um...
If you want, I can give you a lift to Mercer on my way to work.
Thanks.
They have a courtesy van.
It's no trouble.
And I can wait with you at the hospital if you want.
I don't need a babysitter, Roxy.
It's just a post-op exam.
Even Jessica stopped going to those eventually.
You know, we're both really sorry about what's happened.
This?
Or my wife running out on me?
I was thinking about Jessica.
To hell with her.
Thank you for breakfast.
(Inhales deeply)
(Inhales and exhales)
(Doorbell rings)
(Roxy) Hey.
You're not gonna believe this.
Come on in.
(Voice breaks) Hector cheated on me.
What?
(Sniffles) With some skank he met at a bar.
Are you kidding me?
How did you find out?
I-I saw an e-mail she sent him.
And then he tried to lie his way out of it, but then he finally caved in.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
(Crying) I-I just-
- I can't believe he did this to me, you know?
You were right about that necklace.
That wasn't love.
That was guilt.
Aww.
It's okay.
(Footsteps approach)
- Hey, Roxy.
Uh, do you have any gauze?
- Oh-- oh, my God.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Uh, Cody, this is Gloria.
Gloria, Cody.
Uh, yeah.
I'll come back later.
(Sighs)
Uh, that's our friend I was telling you about.
I can't believe I did that, Rox.
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry about Cody.
I'll talk to him.
(Sighs)
Come on.
Sit down.
Let's talk about you, okay?
(Indistinct conversations)
Lieutenant.
It's Cruz again, sir.
What now?
On top of being late again this morning, he's telling me he needs to move into barracks.
It's a bad situation, sir, and it's not getting any better.
We need to drop the hammer.
Okay.
(Clatters)
Cruz.
Sergeant Wisniewski tells me
- you're still having problems at home.
- A little fight is all.
Any connection between your personal life and this platoon ends today.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
You have 24 hours to present to me a written plan on how you're gonna fix this situation with your wife.
In that plan, I expect to see an appointment with a marriage counselor or a divorce attorney.
Are we clear?
Head and eyes forward!
Yes, sir.
You're down to your last strike, Cruz.
Failure to comply will result in an article 15.
We're done here.
(Knock on door)
May I come in?
It's your house.
I'm sorry about that.
Gloria didn't mean to be rude.
She asked me to apologize.
You look like a monster, people are gonna react that way.
It's really not that bad, you know.
Your face, I mean.
You're still the same great guy underneath all that.
No, I'm not.
(Man)
- What do you mean, you can't help me?
!
- Sir...
- Sir--
- I need my meds!
Bernie.
Just calm down.
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Oh, there's my girlfriend.
She'll-- she'll straighten this out.
What-
- Straighten what out, Bernie?
- What's going on?
- I'm dead.
You're-- you're what?
Look, according to my computer, this man is officially deceased.
Surprised the hell outta me, too.
All right, look, Mr. Wolzoczak's my patient.
He's a vet, and I can vouch for the fact that he's very much alive.
Thank you.
Trust me, nothing would make me happier than to give him his prescription and send him on his way.
But I can't do that.
The system won't let me.
See what I'm dealing with?
Look, you can't override the system?
I'm not gonna break the law.
I'd like to take this pinhead and twist him into a pretzel.
- Bernie, that's not helpful.
- I need my meds.
Look, if it's a legal matter, I-I know someone who can help.
Okay?
(Claudia Joy) So let's get this straight, last week your pension and social security checks failed to arrive?
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, th-then yesterday, I got a letter
"to the executor of my estate."
Hmm.
Have you heard of something like this happening before?
Not exactly.
It sounds like a clerical error.
Let me find out who to talk to here at the hospital.
Well, thank you, ma'am.
Happy to help.
♪
Gloria.
I am not talking to you.
You gotta come to marriage counseling with me.
What?
It's not my idea.
It's the army.
But if you don't go, I might get an article 15, which means lower rank and less pay.
Oh, this is about money.
It's not like that.
You know it.
Come here.
(Huffs)
I don't know anything, Hector, not after the other night.
Look, you don't have to talk to the counselor.
All you have to do is show up.
- Why should I?
- Because it's important.
Important to who, you?
To the both of us.
Baby, we're just going through a little problem right now.
That's all.
We can fix this.
Yeah, that's what you think this is, a little problem?
(Scoffs)
Gloria, I love you.
Little late for that.
Are you really willing to admit before God and everyone that this marriage is over, your sisters, your mother?
(Door squeaks open) Kevin.
Hey.
For once, Pentagon meetings were shorter than expected.
I caught an early hop home.
So I see.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
You off to work?
Not yet.
I had something else on my agenda.
Really?
Yeah.
It's classified.
(Water running)
(Sighs)
(Water turns off)
So everything went well in Washington?
Yeah.
Kevin, what aren't you telling me?
I know a little bit more about our deployment.
(Sighs)
I thought you'll be there to train Afghan nationals.
No.
32nd will be patrolling the Pakistani border.
(Groans)
I asked for the new assignment.
I want my troops to be where we're most needed.
Mm. (Sighs)
There's nothing new here.
No, you've always been consistent.
First to the fight.
Doing what I was born to do.
But I'm still allowed to worry about you.
You'll be okay?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
I have more support now than I ever did, but I'm not sure how Sophie's gonna take it.
She'll be strong.
She takes after her mother.
(Sighs)
I understand what a terrible inconvenience this must be for you, Mr. Wolzoczak.
And I do apologize.
Apology accepted.
Just mark down that I'm alive and kickin', and we'll call it even.
I'm afraid it isn't that simple.
- Why not?
- From what I can determine, the problem originated with the VA.
(Clicks)
The Department of Veterans Affairs listed you as "deceased,"
and all other government agencies fell in line.
Well, why would the VA do a damn fool thing like that?
We'll figure it out, Bernie.
In the meantime, there must be some way we can get his prescriptions filled.
Yes.
I'm satisfied that Mr. Wolzoczak is still very much with us. (Chuckles)
I'll authorize his medication.
(Pen clicks) Well, hallelujah.
(Chuckles) But you're going to keep having problems until you clear things up with the VA.
That'll be our next stop then, isn't it, Counselor?
I guess it is.
Good luck.
So I'll try to make an appointment with the VA for tomorrow.
Great.
Uh, in the meantime,
I was wondering if you could give me a lift.
Where to?
Uh, my American legion post.
It-- it's not far as the crow flies, but it's, uh, two bus transfers, and it's a pain in the butt.
Happy to take you.
Oh, you're an angel.
Thank you so much.
Oh, and... we gotta make one stop along the way.
(Indistinct conversations)
(Man) Well...
Look what the cat dragged in.
(Bernie) You know, you might want to think of putting some low-fat items on your list.
Unless of course that's, uh, body armor you're wearing.
(Chuckles)
All muscle, baby.
Right.
All your muscle's between your ears.
(Laughs) Thanks, buddy.
(Laughs)
Hey.
Hey.
How was your appointment?
Everything checked out.
They even gave me this nifty little ball to strengthen the tendons in my hand.
Isn't it the other hand?
Look, um...
I was talking to a friend of mine.
He's a psychiatrist.
He works with a lot of soldiers.
And... he said he'd be happy to talk to you.
If you're interested.
I've talked to a ton of shrinks since this happened, and it's all the same.
"One day at a time, small victories,"
blah, blah, blah, blah.
Look, Cody...
I'm worried about you.
I'm not gonna kill myself, if that's what's bothering you.
I couldn't do that to my mother.
I'm all that...
She has in this world.
Isn't that a pathetic thought?
I know you're trying to help me.
But I'm not your problem, all right?
The 32nd will be responsible for securing Paktika province.
Now with the current drawdowns in effect,
CENTCOM has directed me to deploy only two of our three combat brigades.
I have selected second and third brigade for the mission.
Frank, you'll remain at Fort Marshall with first brigade as part of rear detachment.
Roger that, sir.
Brendan, Steve, you want to stick around for further briefing?
Frank, we can discuss rear-D responsibilities later.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Burton?
Hey, Charlie, come in.
Thanks.
How's David?
We miss him at the YAC.
Well, his punishment goes another week, then he'll be back.
But I suspect this is much more of an official visit.
I don't suppose that has anything to do with your request for two more computers?
It's not for me.
It's for the kids.
You wouldn't believe what they can do with computers,
- even the younger ones.
- Charlie...
The computers we have are antiques, Colonel.
Give it here.
Is that new?
(Chuckles) Yes, it is.
(Chuckles) Last week.
It's beautiful.
Have you set a date yet?
Uh, sometime in the fall, probably, in DC.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I'll see what I can do about this, but no promises, Charlie.
Of course not, but--
I'll let you know.
Right.
(Chuckles)
What do you think about Columbus Day weekend?
Fall colors, nice time for a wedding.
I told you, I have to know my training schedule before I can commit to anything.
Okay.
(Sighs)
What?
You want to tell me what's going on?
Nothing.
(Exhales)
My mom's coming for the awards ceremony.
You invited her?
No, I didn't invite her.
I told her about it, and she wants to be here to see her daughter get a Bronze Star.
Look, it won't be a problem.
She's staying at a hotel.
That's not the problem, Nikki.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what it means.
She calls me your roommate, and you let her.
She knows what's going on.
(Sighs) What does she know?
Does she know we're engaged?
Not yet.
But I promise to tell her when she's here.
You just have to let me do it my way, Charlie.
She's my mother.
(Frank) It's not right, D.
My brigade's being left on the sidelines.
Well, haven't you always said that rear detachment's an important job?
Of course it is.
It's not where the action is.
Any soldier would rather be at the front.
And, you know, General Clarke didn't hesitate for a second to bring first brigade into Narubu.
But now...
What, you think there's a connection?
Well, it's a hell of a coincidence, don't you think?
That mission turned into a political nightmare.
Now he's throwing me under the bus.
I don't understand.
The army cleared the brigade of any wrongdoing.
Sure.
A few weeks later,
General Clarke's passed up for a third star.
It's perception, D. It's all-- It's all about perception.
You really think that Kevin Clarke would do that to you after all the years you've served together?
All I know is that whatever CENTCOM says, it's the Division Commander who gets to decide which brigades get deployed and which ones don't.
(Sighs)
You're awfully quiet this morning.
Mm.
Denise?
Oh, it's Frank.
He's not thrilled with his rear-D assignment.
(Chuckles) Just like Kevin, doesn't want to be left behind.
Yeah, exactly.
Is he being left behind?
What?
Well, no, it's just that...
Frank and Kevin have always been so tight...
A-and I'm sure that's why
Kevin made the assignment that he did, because he trusts Frank.
Right.
Oh, I should get going.
I'll-
- I'll see myself out.
Talk later?
Sure.
Yeah.
(Door closes)
I've discovered the source of the problem.
There's two Bernard Wolzoczaks.
You're kidding me.
(Laughs)
No.
Last month, 21-year-old specialist Bernard Wolzoczak from Ashton, Idaho, was killed in Afghanistan.
Somehow his death was entered under your social security number.
Here I was, thinking I was the one with the bad news.
21 years old.
Poor kid.
So does this mean the other Bernard Wolzoczak is still classified as alive?
Yes.
So his family is probably having difficulty claiming death benefits.
I've already alerted my supervisor.
Well...
We appreciate your clearing this up.
Glad to help.
Mr. Wolzoczak, we regret the error.
We should have your proper status back within the next three to six weeks.
(Claudia Joy) It's unacceptable, Michael.
It shouldn't take so long to set things right.
Not only is Bernie suffering, so is that family of the fallen soldier.
I agree, but I can't just pick up the phone and ream somebody out over at the VA.
Why not?
'Cause the Department of Veterans Affairs is entirely separate from the army.
You know that.
Are you telling me that a phone call from a General wouldn't get results?
There is a process to this, Claudia Joy.
Plus the army might frown on a General exerting undue influence on behalf of his wife's client.
Well, he's not a client.
I'm not charging him.
I fail to see the difference.
You are advocating for him.
Oh, it's not just about him, Michael.
What about that family in Idaho?
(Sighs)
Can you imagine how a mistake like this is compounding their grief?
You really are a good lawyer, aren't you?
(Nicole) So, mom, this is it.
It's lovely.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Lorraine.
Welcome to our home.
Thank you.
Would you like the nickel tour?
Certainly, just let me freshen up.
Oh, first door on the right.
Thanks, honey.
She wanted to come here before the hotel.
So... did you tell her?
It didn't come up.
It didn't come up?
Nikki, she's not gonna ask you.
You have to tell her.
I will handle it.
- I don't think so.
- Charlie...
You're gonna back away again like you always do.
(Sighs)
Where's your ring?
Do we really have to talk about this right now?
Oh, much better.
You girls have done a wonderful job with this place.
Thank you.
Charlie's the decorator.
Well...
Nicole is fortunate to have a roommate with so much style.
Lorraine--
Uh, you know what, mom?
Actually, you should see the backyard.
- We have a great garden.
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Lorraine--
- Charlie, this isn't the time.
Time for what?
I'm not Nicole's roommate.
I'm her fiancee... and we're getting married.
Uh... excuse me.
(Door closes) Proud of yourself?
(Door opens and closes)
Mom, wait.
Mom, I'm sorry.
This isn't how I wanted things to go.
That was thoughtless, what Charlie did.
Is this because of me?
What did I do wrong?
You did nothing wrong.
Just tell me...
Are you really going to m-marry that woman?
Yes, I am.
Why?
(Voice breaks) Because I love her, mom.
Take me to the hotel, please.
Mom--
Please.
So Denise told me that First Brigade isn't deploying.
Correct.
They're on rear-D.
Right.
Okay.
Where is this coming from?
Nothing.
I guess Frank isn't too happy about it.
Did Denise say that?
Yeah, in so many words.
One of the brigades always has to stay behind.
I know.
But I got the feeling that Frank feels like he's being punished for what happened in Africa.
Punished?
No.
There were political considerations.
- There always are.
- Political?
(Sighs)
The White House would prefer
First Brigade not bring its baggage into Afghanistan at this point.
Just in case we find ourselves in another sensitive situation.
Right.
Did you argue?
No.
I agreed.
(Keys clatter)
I had to do it, Nikki.
We're not talking about this.
Right.
Just like your mother.
If we don't talk about it, it doesn't exist.
You know something?
You don't know my mother any better than she knows you.
At least I've tried.
No, you haven't.
All you've done is get in her face.
- That's not true.
- It is true.
Charlie, you don't know what it was like.
After my father died, I became everything to her.
And she was everything to me, everything.
Okay, but why--
She was my rock.
My strength comes from her.
Okay.
So why does that strength disappear when she's around?
That's not fair.
Why not?
How is it you're getting a medal for valor but you can't find the courage to tell your mother we're getting married?
Well, she knows now.
And she may never recover from it.
She'll recover.
I'm going to bed.
(Sighs)
(Sighs)
(TV playing indistinctly)
Look what I found?
(Turns off TV)
That was right before the, uh, Final Road march at OCS.
Yep.
You came in first that day.
(Chuckles) Hell of a soldier.
Nah, hell of a recruit.
Not much of a soldier.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
Trev, I never got a chance to do squat.
It was my-- my fourth day in theater.
It was my first time outside the wire.
I was 500 meters from the patrol base when that IED went off.
I never...
Saw any enemy.
I didn't fire my weapon.
All I did do...
Was get thrown from a humvee and burn.
That doesn't make you any less of a soldier.
I guess that depends on how you look at it.
Yeah.
That's right.
This doesn't have to be the end of your career.
Oh, I see.
I see.
Is-- is this the pep talk?
Is this the halftime motivation?
(Sighs) I'm just trying to help out here, man.
Look at me, Trevor.
Look at-
- Look at this claw.
I'm not a soldier anymore.
Hey.
Maybe not infantry, but you could change your MOS.
With your brains, you could do a lot in this army, even lead soldiers again.
Your career isn't over until you say it is.
It's over.
(Sighs)
Okay, so why are we here?
You're really just gonna sit there?
We're having some problems.
(Clears throat)
Problems?
We're here 'cause this sorry ass excuse for a husband cheated on me.
Hector, is that true?
Damn right, it's true.
I caught him.
- Mrs. Cruz--
- Gloria.
Gloria, the way that this works is that you both get to talk.
And right now I'd like to hear from your husband.
Hector.
Do you want to tell me what happened?
We're waiting.
(Sighs)
(Panting) (Panting)
Ah, damn it.
(Growls and barks)
Hey.
Hey.
Give me that.
Hey.
Give me that ball.
Give me that ball!
(Growling)
Give me the ball!
(Barking)
Shut up.
Shut up!
Shut up!
(Continues barking)
Hey!
Stop yelling at the dog.
Yeah, well, he took my ball.
(Whines) Well, he probably thought you wanted to play with him.
Good boy.
It's okay.
(Whines)
(Barks) Good boy.
You know, I gotta tell you, we've all been walking around on egg shells trying to make you feel good.
I didn't ask you to!
Here's your ball.
You know what?
I've got a friend whose son died in Afghanistan.
(Voice breaking) She'd give anything to have him back here, no matter what shape he was in.
And I guarantee you, he would not be sitting here feeling sorry for himself.
He'd be living every day.
Come on, Lucky.
Let's go for a walk.
(Door opens and closes)
(Woman) Okay, I'm afraid we have to end now.
There's been a lot of anger expressed here today.
That's part of the process.
That said, counseling will only work if both parties want it to work.
So I ask you both to think carefully.
Do you want this to work?
Well, absolutely.
Gloria?
I don't know.
(Hector) What was that?
You don't know?
What-- what do you mean, you don't know?
It means, I don't know, okay?
No, not okay.
Look, you just said I had to show up.
I showed up.
And let me remind you, we wouldn't be here if you could keep it in your pants.
Well, if you hadn't kept working at the hump bar we'd have never had a fight, and none of this woulda ever happened in the first place.
You're unbelievable.
(Scoffs)
Gloria.
Gloria!
(Sighs)
Mom, please...
Stay.
I'd only be in the way.
No, you wouldn't.
You know, just because I have Charlie doesn't mean I don't love you, too.
You are breaking my heart, mom.
Well, you've already broken mine.
I didn't mean to.
I never meant to hurt you, ever.
But I can't help the way I am.
And I can't hide it anymore, mom, or apologize for it, either.
I won't.
The army understands.
Why can't you?
(Huffs)
(Sighs, voice breaks) I'm sorry.
(Cries) I'm sorry, mom.
(Sniffles)
(Sniffles)
(Exhales deeply)
I had these dreams for you...
So many dreams.
Seeing you walk down the aisle...
Having children of your own.
I know.
(Sniffles)
All those things are still possible.
Just not exactly how you pictured them.
It would really mean a lot to me if you were there at the ceremony.
But it's your decision.
I will love you either way.
(Exhales)
(Sniffles)
(Knock on door)
(Sighs) Oh, um, s-sorry.
(Sighs) Is Roxy here?
No, she's out walking the dog.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, I'll just come back later.
You-- you can-- you can stay here and wait for her if you want.
She should be back soon.
Uh, maybe I'll do that,
I-if you don't mind.
Come on in.
I'll leave you alone.
Hey...
I'm sorry about the other day and the way that I acted.
It's okay.
No, I apologize.
(Crying) I had a lot going on.
Hey.
Still do, obviously.
Thanks.
(Sniffles)
I'm Gloria.
Cody.
Do you, uh...
You want to talk about it?
Okay.
My husband cheated on me.
Really?
What is he, blind?
(Chuckles)
No.
Just a jerk.
(Sighs)
My wife left me a couple days ago.
That's terrible.
Leaving you at a time like this?
Yeah, she isn't blind, either.
To be honest, we'd been having trouble for...
A while.
And in a way, I think...
This kept us together longer than we should've.
You know, Jessica...
Wanted to be an investment banker's wife, not an army wife.
I wonder why.
Hey.
You did something you believed in.
Yeah.
What an idiot.
Nah, don't say that.
You got a lot to be proud of.
Gloria...
Look at me.
Do you really think any woman could ever love me again?
Yeah, I do.
Love's about a lot more than looks,
I could tell you that.
Really?
What is it about?
'Cause I can't remember.
(Laughs)
You and me both.
But I still believe.
I mean, what else is there, right?
Right.
Right.
(Both speaking indistinctly)
(Indistinct conversations)
Nice day.
It is.
Mm-hmm.
(Indistinct conversations continue)
Let's get started.
Yes, sir.
(Indistinct conversations continue)
(Indistinct conversations continue)
There's still a few more minutes.
(Sighs)
(Man, amplified voice) Ladies and gentlemen, please find your seats.
The ceremony is about to begin.
(Indistinct conversations continue)
(Instrumental version of "The Star-Spangled Banner")
(Man) Order arms!
About face!
Good afternoon and welcome to this awards ceremony recognizing the outstanding efforts of the First Brigade, 32nd Airborne Division.
(Camera shutter clicks) The soldiers you see here represent the finest achievements of all those who participated in Operation Javelin.
They did their job flawlessly.
And we should all be proud of what they accomplished in Narubu.
(Applause)
(Man) Attention orders.
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Bronze Star medal with "V" device to Captain Nicole Galassini,
United States Army, for her heroic achievement in support of Operation Javelin in the Republic of Narubu.
Captain Galassini's actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military service and bring credit upon herself, the 32nd Airborne Division, and the United States Army.
Congratulations, Captain.
The Secretary of the Army takes pleasure in presenting the army commendation medal to staff Sergeant William T. Keller,
United States Army...
Captain, congratulations.
(Man continues speaking indistinctly)
(Camera shutter clicks)
(Chuckles)
(Clicks)
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you, mom.
Charlie.
(Click)
Um, how about one with the three of us?
(Click)
(Indistinct conversations)
Good morning, Counselor.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
I managed to pull a few strings.
You're officially alive again.
(Laughs) Well, hallelujah.
And the other Bernard Wolzoczak, his family's receiving their benefits.
Oh.
Thank you.
Of course.
Think I could catch a ride again?
Another errand?
If-- if it's not a problem.
Where to this time?
(Bird cawing)
That's better.
(Pants)
Did you know this soldier?
Ah, airman.
A buddy from the legion post.
B-17 pilot,
Second World War.
(Laughs) Funny as hell.
(Chuckles)
I-I try to get out here at least once a month to make sure everything's in order.
Hmm.
This guy was a green beret, served in Vietnam.
Tough as nails, even through cancer.
Most of ese guys don't have anybody to look after 'em anymore, so I, uh...
You know, I do what I can.
That's wonderful, Bernie.
Really.
Mm.
Ah, we-- They'd do the same for me.
We...
look after our own.
Mm.
(Trevor) You ready, bud?
Yeah.
So, Trev, been thinking about what you said about me changing my MOS.
And I'm thinking 35 Delta.
Good call.
Military Intelligence.
Yeah, I've always been kind of a hunt-and-peck kind of guy at a computer, so I'm no worse off than I was before.
(Chuckles)
I'll bring the car around.
Thanks, man.
(Door closes) Look, I'm sorry I lost it yesterday--
No, no, I needed to hear it.
I'm sorry I yelled at your dog.
It's okay.
He'll get over it.
And I know I haven't been the world's greatest houseguest.
I will get over it, too.
Just... take care of yourself, okay?
And come back and see us.
You mean it?
Of course I do.
Thanks.
(Door opens)
Previously on Revenge:
- Everybody thinks that you're dead.
- And that's the way it has to stay.
Just in time.
Your daughter's a drug addict and you're already dead.
That makes you both damn easy to dispose of.
I picked up the test results.
Nothing to worry about.
You're going to be a daddy.
Please tell me it's really his.
Sorry.
Don't pretend for one moment that you didn't try to murder me.
I warned you not to get onto that plane.
Whatever happens from this point forward stays between us.
(Clanks)
- So what's next?
- Hit me.
- Who did this?
- You did, and if I were you, I would start running.
(Siren wailing)
You once said I was like my mother.
You knew her, didn't you?
Unfortunately, that's something you'll never know.
(Panting)
(Gunshot) (Grunts)
(Panting)
(Emily) In a race between danger and indecision, the difference between life and death... (Barking) comes down to confidence.
Faith in our abilities, certainty in ourselves... (Panting)
(Dogs continue barking)
Come on.
Right ahead.
(Grunts)
(Barking continues)
And the trust we put in others.
(Barking)
(Emily) We're trapped.
(Barking continues)
We gotta go over.
(Barking continues)
Give me your hand.
(Barking)
(Grunts)
(Groans) Emily, wait.
My leg.
You okay?
Hey!
The race is won.
He cheated.
(Takeda) Yes.
He understood the exercise... to exploit your opponent's weakness.
That is the key to revenge.
Lose your compassion.
(Panting)
No hard feelings.
Why?
!
(Panting)
He wanted you dead.
(Knife clicks closed) I prefer you alive.
And I prefer you 10,000 miles away from here.
Tell Takeda I don't need a nanny.
- Takeda didn't send me.
- He didn't stop you either.
Are you gonna get out, or do I need to throw you out?
What you need right now is my help.
(Panting)
(Daniel) She's cleaning.
She does that when she can't sleep.
Perhaps I should give it a try.
Well, given what you've been through, insomnia seems reasonable.
I wonder what her excuse is.
(Waves crashing)
You miss her, don't you?
I've spent a lot of restless nights out here, Mom.
Either you look at the ocean or Emily's house.
It's simple geography.
Besides, I'm with Ashley now.
Yet, you're still restless.
(Helicopter whirring overhead)
Well, it's kind of hard to sleep with all those reporters camped outside the gate and cluttering the sky.
The news hounds won't stop until they get my story.
And what exactly is your story?
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
(White-haired man) Do you know who this is?
(Victoria) Yes.
Not an easy voice to forget.
After the ding of the seat belt sign, the next sound you'll hear will be 14 ounces of plastic explosives detonating.
My proposition...
Conrad's demise is mutually beneficial.
All it requires is splitting Charlotte's inheritance.
Decline, and your daughter will be joining you in the Grayson family plot.
I'm listening.
And you're certain it was the white-haired man?
Of course.
Who else?
I'm just wondering how he could've boarded the plane completely undetected by ground crew.
You sound like a journalist.
Or even worse, a detective.
Detectives are still on your side last I checked.
And the implication is that you are not?
I don't know.
Gordon Murphy.
(Pills rattle) What are those?
(Rattles)
Well, I heard what Mr. Murphy here said about disobeying the order to kill your mother.
That doesn't mean that somebody else didn't finish the job.
(Clatter)
(Cell phone ringing)
You going to answer your phone?
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring, beep)
Victoria.
Don't think me intrusive, but I see that you're awake.
I was just turning in.
Well, I thought the events of the day might be keeping you up.
(Chuckles)
No, it's the reporters that keep knocking on my door.
They saw me leaving Grayson Manor earlier.
They want to know everything.
Well, I trust you staved them off.
So far.
But they are persistent.
Yes, they are.
Come over tomorrow, and we'll discuss a strategy on how to handle them.
That sounds great.
Good night, Victoria.
(Beep)
Let me see Murphy's phone.
It's destroyed, thanks to you.
- And why do you want it anyway?
- To finish what you started... identify and take down the initiative.
This man was their agent.
That phone could lead us to them.
This phone could lead to my mother.
I am keeping it.
Look, the loss of your mother...
I know exactly how it feels.
But do not let it distract you from your true mission.
You are better than that.
I want you to leave.
Now.
Sorry.
I've got other instructions.
Takeda.
I thought he didn't send you.
He's lost faith.
I'm here to restore it.
So sooner or later, you're gonna have to start trusting me again.
Now... are you gonna take the head or the feet?
(Grunts)
(Pants)
The head.
(Lowered voice) Leave the little stuff.
Just jewelry and cash.
Check the desk.
(Lowered voice) Hey, hey.
Oh, nice.
Hey, keep looking.
No.
No, look, we got enough.
I'm calling it.
Pfft.
To pay for four years of college?
Not all in one night and from the same house, man.
Who leaves a baseball signed by babe Ruth out in the open?
A guy who can afford another one.
(Switch clicks) (Woman) I'm exhausted.
- Okay, now we call it.
Come on.
- (Man) I'm gonna check my e-mail.
(Sniffs)
Mmm.
Can't sleep?
(Sighs)
Whoever said warm milk does the trick obviously never tasted it.
You know, pretty soon, late nights are gonna be a regular thing.
You ready?
Not until we can figure out the nursery.
I'm not doing late-night feedings by the beer taps.
(Sighs)
(Sighs)
All right, look...
(Blows air)
How about this?
Declan's room... fresh coat of paint, steam clean the rugs, bring my grandma's rocking chair down from the attic.
Cheap and cheerful, just for the short term.
(Chuckles) Or...
We can use the gift certificate
Charlotte sent us from that fancy baby store in the village and do up the room in style.
$5,000?
No, no, no.
We don't accept charity from the Graysons.
They can buy their way into the headlines.
They're not buying their way into my child's life.
Technically, Charlotte is not a Grayson.
She's a Clarke, like me, and she's excited to be an aunt.
What's the big deal?
She can be an aunt without throwing money at us.
Just...
Return the gift, Amanda.
I'll sort out the baby's room.
(Sighs)
I've spoken to my contact at Vanity Fair and confirmed their one-on-one with Mrs. Grayson.
You're going public?
She's going nuclear.
Your mother... is inviting every vulture in the sky down for a feast, attempting to capitalize on the one thing she's never really had... sympathy.
(Ashley) I've come up with a list of talking points.
We're keeping it vague, avoiding the gory details, and focusing on Victoria's miraculous return.
Daniel and I don't need talking points.
We weren't involved.
(Daniel) What do the authorities say?
How will this affect their investigation?
(Victoria) Well, the more people who know who we're looking for, the better chance we have of finding him.
Until then, no one leaves this house, and no one addresses the press alone.
You're grounding all of us?
It's safer to stay inside until this media storm passes.
Oh, one big happy family.
Someone please pass the pain de mie.
- (Nolan) It's toast.
- Can you recover the contact list?
Wait.
Is that a bullet hole?
Can you fix it or not?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Won't ask, won't tell, will fix.
At least, I'll try.
- Oh!
You're actually here.
- Oh.
Ignore my text telling you to wake up.
Oh, don't we have a meeting?
We do.
You've just never shown up to one before.
Hmm.
Oh, Emily, this is Padma Lahari, my new C.F.O.
The I.R.S. is all up in Nolcorp's grill, and luckily Padma is the audit whisperer.
Hmm.
Um, Padma, this is Emily, my... uh... (Telephone rings)
My...
E...
Emily.
- Mm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a good meeting.
- Mm.
- She's very pretty.
- Mm.
How do you know her?
Oh, we cohabitate.
Well, she asked me to move out.
I...
It's extremely complicated.
(Beeping)
(Crash)
(Whirring)
Hey, get off my truck!
What the hell are you doing?
(Keys jangle)
(Typing)
Animal shelters?
Oh, God.
Don't tell me you want a pet.
I'm looking for a place to volunteer so I don't have to spend my entire summer in this house of dysfunction.
Everyone else knows what really happened to you, Mom.
- Why can't Daniel?
- The last time push came to shove, he chose to align himself with his father.
He can't be trusted...
Yet.
(Sighs)
(Paper rustles)
You spent $5,000 at a baby store?
It's a gift for Amanda.
- She is my sister.
- Half sister, if that.
What is that supposed to mean?
Never mind.
(Sets down paper)
Look, the fact that David Clarke is your father is a secret we have to guard closely for various reasons.
For now, you need to stay away from that girl.
I'm staying away from everyone.
We're sequestered, remember?
No one comes in.
No one goes out.
Well, with one notable exception.
(Emily) So what story are we telling?
I certainly wouldn't want to say anything wrong to the press.
Well, the answer's simple.
You don't know anything.
You barely know us.
I was engaged to your son.
"Ever since Daniel broke it off, the Graysons have kept me at arm's length."
See?
Simple.
- And it's the truth.
- Hmm.
(Sets down cup)
(Sighs) Victoria.
Hmm?
Are you and Charlotte safe here?
(Chuckles) This house may as well be a fortress.
I'm talking about Conrad.
He tried to have you killed.
Oh, don't worry about Conrad.
I'll take care of him in time.
I'm more concerned about you, Emily.
And why is that?
Ever since sharing my secret, your welfare has been at risk, I'm afraid.
And the only way to ensure your safety is by cutting off all ties to my family, effective immediately.
I hate to see our newfound friendship come to an end.
But I have to ask you to stay away, permanently.
I'll have security show you home.
(Sets down cup)
(Birds chirping)
(Doorknob clicking)
(Door creaks)
There's no loitering here.
You want a room, you need to come inside.
(American accent) No need, ma'am.
Detective Lasky.
Southampton Police.
In a rental car?
Department cutbacks.
Have you, uh...
Have you seen this man?
He might be...
Someone that checked in a week ago.
Paid cash.
Stayed one night.
What's he wanted for?
Kidnapping.
Keep your distance.
This is a very dangerous man.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
(Dials cell phone)
(Phone rings)
Southampton Police Department.
(Woman) Southampton Police.
(Engine starts)
Yes, I need to speak with, um, Detective Lasky, please.
No one here by that name.
You might want to try the East Hampton police.
People make that mistake... (Beep)
(Seagull calling)
Kind of sparse for a newborn.
(Chuckles) Yeah, well, it wouldn't be if Jack had accepted Charlotte's gift.
He's determined to keep all things Grayson out of the baby's life.
Mm.
He's got good instincts.
Unfortunately, Victoria has banished me from her premises.
I need you to deliver something for me.
It's one of my father's journals, or at least my version of it.
Victoria's having a press conference.
This press pass will get you through security.
(Scoffs) Are you nuts?
I promised Jack I wouldn't go anywhere near the Graysons.
So lie.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Show this to Charlotte to thank her for her gift.
I told you, I'm returning the gift.
I've wanted a family my whole life.
I'm not jeopardizing that for you or anyone else.
(Sighs)
I thought we were family.
When we exchanged identities, the plan was clear.
You become my past...
And I become your future.
Turns out, I was wrong.
Looks like the future belongs to you.
Please do this for me.
(Nolan) I remember this dinner...
Melinda Gates and Prince, uh, something or other, at Per Se.
It's $3,000.
That's more than twice my rent.
Well, the royals love their bubbly.
Speaking of, um, are you hungry?
I suppose it's not too early to start thinking about dinner.
A working dinner, of course, which is a completely legitimate business write-off... (Cell phone ringing)
- Unlike 90% of the receipts I see here today.
- Oh.
Ems, hey.
How are we on the phone fix?
(Scoffs) "Fix" may be too strong a word.
Hardware's fried.
Contacts, data, text history all bit the dust, or the bullet, as it were.
(Chuckles)
What about the SIM card?
Well, the only thing I could pull from it is the white-haired man's own number, and, well, he's not answering.
That's still helpful.
Can you get it to me?
The phone or the SIM card?
Both, as soon as possible.
Oh, I love it when you're bossy.
It means something hot's gonna happen.
So what can I look forward to?
Watch the 10:00 news.
I'm counting the hours.
(Beep)
Mm.
I gotta go.
Ems needs me.
- What about the...
- Oh, all this?
Oh, we can attack it tomorrow.
See ya.
Let me guess.
The Graysons found the Lindbergh Baby.
What?
The 10:00 news.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Oh, that was nothing.
I got a headline.
We took the paternity test, and it's official.
I'm...
I'm gonna be a dad.
I know.
Amanda told me.
We were just together going over some godmother stuff.
Hmm.
(Sighs) Congratulations.
I'm really happy for you.
Thanks.
(Clears throat) So...
What do you think...
Yankees blue or Jets green?
Well, I think that Amanda's probably more of a football fan than a baseball fan, but...
you'll have to ask her.
I'll see you.
Emily.
Just, thank you...
For agreeing to be in this kid's life, for having my back, always, for being Amanda's friend.
It's what I signed up for.
You know, it's like you never left.
You are not welcome in this bedroom, Conrad.
Oh, so there are limits on how far you're willing to go with this charade.
(Chuckles)
You ruffled a violent man when you pulled off your double cross.
Aren't you the tiniest bit afraid that he might come for you?
Or perhaps you and he are working together even now.
To what end?
(Chuckling) Oh, I don't know.
My destruction.
You may have trusted me enough to help with your bogus kidnapping story.
(Whispers) But I... don't... trust... you.
Well, that won't be an issue for you much longer, Conrad.
We may be quarantined here for a while, but come summer's end when this story runs its course,
I will be leaving you for good.
Well...
Summer's end is a long way off, my dear.
(Creaks)
Ems?
Emily?
Uhh!
Aah!
(Both grunting)
Aiden!
Aiden, get off of him!
(Groans and coughs)
(Emily) It's okay.
Just breathe.
(Pants) Why does this keep happening to me?
- Who is that guy?
- An ally.
Nolan, where's the phone?
(Sighs)
(Whispers) I told you, it's empty.
(Sighs) Listen...
You need to get out of here.
Come back in the morning.
I'll explain everything.
(Grunts)
(Clatter)
(Nolan) Nice meeting you...
Jerk.
(Door closes)
Are you disappointed to see me alive?
Death by dumpster had such flair.
Seemed fitting.
I found the flight recorder from Victoria's plane.
- I thought we could make a trade.
- What do you want?
Everything the white-haired man had on him when he died.
Please.
(Closes panel)
Look, whatever you're thinking,
I'm not the enemy.
I owe you an apology.
The only thing you owe me tonight is your absence.
(Sighs) You made a fool of me.
That wasn't my intention.
I had to win that exercise.
(Scoffs)
Takeda would never have let me go if I had failed.
Go where?
Takeda found my sister.
I leave tonight.
But you're only halfway through your training.
It doesn't matter.
This might be my last chance.
Her last chance, so...
Look, I...
I will come back for you.
I...
I promise.
Aiden, wait.
- I'm coming with you.
- No.
It's too dangerous.
Exactly.
I've already lost everything.
I'm not losing you, too.
Meet me in the maze at midnight.
(Sighs)
Just because you failed to save your sister doesn't me that I'm gonna fail at finding my mother.
It's not whether you find her or not that you should be worrying about.
It's what you'll find when you do.
Good-bye, Aiden.
(Rattling)
Any idea where you'll go?
I decline to answer as I happen to like my neck willowy and working.
Who the hell was that guy last night?
The less you know about him, the better.
Right.
- I'm gonna miss you, too, Ems.
- Nolan.
The white-haired man is dead.
His name was...
Gordon Murphy.
He had a bottle of pills on him...
Fluphenazine, an antipsychotic, one of the strongest.
Well, that fits.
He was a crazy killer.
He might have been a killer, but he wasn't crazy.
I think the pills belonged to my mother.
- That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?
- No, but I found this on him.
He knew her...
Intimately.
How can I help?
(Pocket watch snaps shut) You've already done enough.
One day I will find a way to thank you.
Well...
Find her.
That'll be thanks enough.
(Door opens)
(Gasps) Whoa, sailor.
You scared me.
I thought you were out, um, filing for plumbing permits.
I was.
I just, uh, I just forgot some paperwork.
You look nice.
- I'm wearing a tent.
- Shut up.
You're gorgeous.
Where you going all dressed up?
Emily is taking me shopping for, um, a changing table
- and a diaper pail.
- Without me?
- Really?
- No, not really.
Thank you for not including me, actually.
I mean that sincerely.
Thank Emily for me, too.
Although I feel like that's all I've been doing lately.
How do you mean?
Just that she's generous to a fault.
Right.
So, um, I'll be back soon.
Okay.
Have fun.
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
We've got a lot of construction going on.
We should be open inside of a couple of weeks.
I'm not looking for a drink.
You know this kid?
Yeah.
That's my brother.
Oh.
Well, we need to talk.
Emily, what are you doing here?
I'm not staying.
A press van's blocking the driveway.
I was hoping you could make an announcement.
We are minutes away from starting.
You in a hurry?
No.
No.
But, uh, Mr. Knowles across the street isn't so understanding.
I begged him to hold off calling the police until I spoke with you, but...
Thanks.
I'm on it.
Eve!
You don't want to stick around for the main event?
Your mother asked me to steer clear of your family.
I thought maybe she was speaking for you.
She wasn't.
Mr. Grayson, this arrived at the gate.
Who sent it?
Don't know, sir.
It came during a shift change.
Thank you.
"Veronica Clarke."
I should've known.
- What is it?
- Confirmation.
Of what?
Every terrible thought I've ever had about my mother.
Okay, I'm here.
What's the emergency?
I want you to meet Mr. Ryan.
Someone broke into his place the other night, and they were dumb enough to leave this behind.
What the hell were you thinking?
I...
I w...
um, I wasn't.
I saw two kids running away from my property.
- Who was with you?
- No one.
You steal from me, then call me a liar?
No, sir, but like I said, it was just me.
(Jack) I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.
We lost our dad last year, but I swear, this isn't the way he raised us.
We can meet you down at the police station.
I'll tell you what... if the kid gives back what he took,
I won't press charges.
I was young and stupid once, too.
Careful, though.
Your next mark might not be so nice.
You come by my place tomorrow?
You know where it is.
He'll be there.
Thank you.
Listen, if there's ever anything I can do for you, you just...
just let me know.
You know what, barkeep?
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Nice going.
Hey.
- You look gorgeous.
- Amanda.
- How did you get up here?
- A sister has her ways.
My mother will freak if she knows you're up here.
Not a big fan of surprises.
I'm not afraid of her.
You shouldn't be either.
- I'm not.
- Good, 'cause if we're gonna get closer,
I...
I can't protect her anymore.
What is this?
A journal our father kept in prison.
I marked the entries that I thought you should read first.
But I have to warn you, what it says about your mother isn't pretty.
I can't imagine the fear you must have felt...
- eight weeks of torture?
- Mm-hmm.
Tell me, did you ever have a moment where you felt like giving up?
No.
The thought of never seeing my children again was far worse than anything my captor could have ever done to me.
You can call it a mother's will to survive.
(Charlotte) More like a monster's.
I just found out the real reason you don't want me having a relationship with Amanda.
Because she knows the truth about what you did to my father.
Charlotte, this is not the time.
Who, for the record, was David Clarke.
You run that, and I will sue you for libel.
It's only libel if it isn't true.
Go ahead, Mom.
Deny it.
(Voice breaks) That's what I thought.
This interview's over.
Mom wasn't kidnapped.
She was planning to disappear.
Where did you get this?
Someone dropped it at the guard house along with that note.
She was working with him, Dad.
No, open threats are not this man's style.
If he truly wanted her dead, then she would be.
No, you're missing the larger revelation here.
Mom faked her own kidnapping.
My boy, at this moment, there are things at play that dwarf your penchant for gullibility.
Wait.
You knew about this?
Charlotte, wait.
Hey, both of you, get in here now.
Now!
You selfish, manipulative liar.
Where did this come from?
Where do you think?
Daniel, this secret was killing me.
I begged her to tell you.
You knew, too?
Don't blame her.
I can explain.
Oh, with what, more lies?
You should be begging for my forgiveness after pulling a scam like this.
You should be begging for my forgiveness, dear son.
I handed you proof of Conrad's guilt, and you chose his lies over the truth.
And the blood of every person on that government plane is on your hands as well as his.
Charlotte, whatever your mother's been telling you, pay no attention.
She's clearly not in her right mind.
And we are canceling this sham of an event.
Do that, and I will have your head on a pike.
You know, as fine as I am with a hired killer targeting you, he won't stop there, Victoria.
We're leaving the country tonight, all of us.
No, I'm through with hiding.
I'm going to put a stop to this right now, come what may.
I am so sorry for all the hell my mother put you through while we were together.
No one in their right mind would choose to live inside this family.
I despise her.
Word of advice.
Keep it to yourself.
The only way to beat your mother is to play her game better than she does.
(Ashley) Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
We're about to begin, and please...
Amanda, wait.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were banned from the premises.
I was.
I am.
But I'm staying for this, and so are you.
No.
I already did what you asked.
Jack would kill me if he knew I was here.
And Jack would kill you if he knew that baby you're carrying isn't his.
(Sighs)
This is that important to me.
The choice is yours.
(Victoria, amplified voice) Ladies and gentlemen, it's always been my motto that from bad comes good.
(Camera shutters clicking)
So tonight there will be no rehashing of the past... only my aspirations for the future.
Violence to one is violence to all.
And so I would like to acknowledge those close to me who have been touched by this tragedy.
She's gone off book.
She's going to tank.
- First...
- I doubt that very much.
My daughter Charlotte.
During my confinement, I promised God that if given another chance, I would live in truth.
And this starts with the biggest admission of my life.
(Camera shutters clicking)
Charlotte...
Is the blessed consequence of my affair with David Clarke.
(Reporters gasping and murmuring)
Sweetheart, would you step up here, please?
(Murmuring continues)
(Camera shutters clicking)
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring, beep)
Yes.
(Woman) Conrad, you're a smart man, so I know you've been expecting this call.
Your wife's very public accusations about our agent's alleged transgression has us all deeply concerned.
A course of action has been decided, and it involves your participation.
Next, to the saint among men...
We'll be in touch.
Who forgave my infidelity and cherished Charlotte as his own...
Conrad, come.
(Camera shutters clicking, reporters continue murmuring)
And finally, my son Daniel, whose loyalty knows no bounds.
(Camera shutters clicking, reporters continue murmuring)
There is one person missing... someone who has seen more bad than good from us, and who has never been scared off.
Her tenacity I admire, and I wish to welcome her into the fold...
Along with her child...
Amanda Clarke,
Charlotte's half sister.
(Reporters murmuring)
Amanda, please join us.
(Reporters continue murmuring)
(Victoria) Please.
(Camera shutters clicking)
To my abductor and to anyone who thinks they can harm this family again, make no mistake, you will fail.
(Man) Mrs. Grayson!
(Reporters shouting questions at once)
- (Lowered voice) Understood?
- (Woman) Excuse me.
(Victoria, amplified voice) This concludes the press conference.
As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no questions tonight.
(Reporters) Victoria!
Victoria!
My God, they're stronger than ever.
(Reporters shout indistinctly)
Mom.
Thank you for your show of solidarity tonight.
Your performance was flawless.
I wasn't performing.
The truth is, I'd hate myself if I'd gotten you back only to lose you again.
I'm willing to put this all behind us if you are.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
(Woman laughs)
Oh, what a lovely tableau... mother and son reunited.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna check on Ashley.
Ms. Fisk, my apologies if today's event ruined our interview.
Actually, Conrad just made up for it by offering me an exclusive on your upcoming wedding.
I'm sorry if I spilled the proverbial beans, my pet.
I mean, I just...
I think I just got caught up in the whole... affair.
(Chuckles)
And Tuscany?
An exquisite place to honeymoon.
I'd expect nothing less.
- Thank you both.
Good night.
- Good night.
(Footsteps retreat, door opens)
You should consider it a small price to pay for publicly branding me a cuckold.
(Door closes)
I so look forward to you resuming your wifely duties, dear.
Oh, well, if that threat has any merit,
- you and I will be dead before then.
- Oh, I wouldn't bet on that.
See, I've got some breaking news of my own.
While you were dazzling the press corps,
I got a phone call from your would-be assassin's employers.
It turns out that his recent, uh, rogue and high-profile escapades have made him a target now.
So he's as good as dead, so long as we cooperate.
Oh, you fool.
You've just put us back in bed with the very architects of this entire nightmare.
(Chuckles) Oh, Victoria.
This family has you to thank for that.
Jack?
What are you doing in here?
You and your new family were all over the news.
Did you think I wouldn't see it?
I can explain.
It's better if I do that.
My brother is the most important person in my life to me, so I get that you'd like to build a relationship with your sister.
That's exactly it, Jack.
Charlotte begged me to be there.
And if Declan needed me,
I would drop everything to be there for him, too.
It was wrong of me to try to control your relationship with the Graysons, but...
(Sighs)
This is the last time I take ownership for your lies.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm committed to our child.
I just don't think I can commit to you.
(Sniffles)
You were right.
It's no good.
Any contacts that could've led me to the initiative were destroyed with that bullet, so I... had to go to plan "b."
You sent the passport to the Graysons to make them think the white-haired man was coming for them.
And it worked.
Conrad and the initiative are already in contact.
I had my own plan.
You could've destroyed everything.
But I didn't, did I?
Amanda Clarke is embedded in that family, and Daniel Grayson is out to ruin his mother.
Better still, he trusts you again.
You were at the house.
(Chuckles)
Oh, it was fantastic watching you capitalize on the serendipity of my actions.
Stop acting like you have my best interests at heart.
Our interests used to be one and the same.
(Wind whistling)
- Aiden?
- He's gone.
Your lover has left you behind.
I don't believe you.
This is another one of your tests.
No.
No test.
Whether you believe it or not, he chose to leave you just the same.
How does it feel to have opened yourself to betrayal, same as your father?
If you want to succeed in your goal, you must learn to close your heart.
The young man you trusted understood.
Yet, still...
You do not.
I want you to leave.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry before you'll trust me again?
(Electronic female voice) You have one unheard message.
To listen to your messages, press 1.
(Beep)
(Kara) Gordon, it's me.
Where are you?
Um, some guy claiming to be a Detective Lasky came by with a...
a sketch, asking questions.
I...
I know what I'm supposed to do, and if I don't hear from you by tomorrow,
I'll...
I'll start shutting everything down and go dark like we promised.
Only I'm hoping I won't have to, that somehow you're still okay.
God, Gordon, please be okay.
I love you.
Previously on Revenge:
- Everybody thinks that you're dead.
- And that's the way it has to stay.
Just in time.
Your daughter's a drug addict and you're already dead.
That makes you both damn easy to dispose of.
I picked up the test results.
Nothing to worry about.
You're going to be a daddy.
Please tell me it's really his.
Sorry.
Don't pretend for one moment that you didn't try to murder me.
I warned you not to get onto that plane.
Whatever happens from this point forward stays between us.
- So what's next?
- Hit me.
- Who did this?
- You did, and if I were you, I would start running.
You once said I was like my mother.
You knew her, didn't you?
Unfortunately, that's something you'll never know.
In a race between danger and indecision, the difference between life and death... comes down to confidence.
Faith in our abilities, certainty in ourselves...
Come on.
Right ahead.
And the trust we put in others.
We're trapped.
We gotta go over.
Give me your hand.
Emily, wait.
My leg.
You okay?
Hey!
The race is won.
He cheated.
- Yes.
- He understood the exercise... to exploit your opponent's weakness.
That is the key to revenge.
Lose your compassion.
No hard feelings.
Why?
!
He wanted you dead.
I prefer you alive.
And I prefer you 10,000 miles away from here.
Tell Takeda I don't need a nanny.
- Takeda didn't send me.
- He didn't stop you either.
Are you gonna get out, or do I need to throw you out?
What you need right now is my help.
She's cleaning.
She does that when she can't sleep.
Perhaps I should give it a try.
Well, given what you've been through, insomnia seems reasonable.
I wonder what her excuse is.
You miss her, don't you?
I've spent a lot of restless nights out here, Mom.
Either you look at the ocean or Emily's house.
It's simple geography.
Besides, I'm with Ashley now.
Yet, you're still restless.
Well, it's kind of hard to sleep with all those reporters camped outside the gate and cluttering the sky.
The news hounds won't stop until they get my story.
And what exactly is your story?
Hello?
Do you know who this is?
Yes.
Not an easy voice to forget.
After the ding of the seat belt sign, the next sound you'll hear will be 14 ounces of plastic explosives detonating.
My proposition...
Conrad's demise is mutually beneficial.
All it requires is splitting Charlotte's inheritance.
Decline, and your daughter will be joining you in the Grayson family plot.
I'm listening.
And you're certain it was the white-haired man?
Of course.
Who else?
I'm just wondering how he could've boarded the plane completely undetected by ground crew.
You sound like a journalist.
Or even worse, a detective.
Detectives are still on your side last I checked.
And the implication is that you are not?
I don't know.
Gordon Murphy.
What are those?
Well, I heard what Mr. Murphy here said about disobeying the order to kill your mother.
That doesn't mean that somebody else didn't finish the job.
You going to answer your phone?
Victoria.
Don't think me intrusive, but I see that you're awake.
I was just turning in.
Well, I thought the events of the day might be keeping you up.
No, it's the reporters that keep knocking on my door.
They saw me leaving Grayson Manor earlier.
They want to know everything.
Well, I trust you staved them off.
So far.
But they are persistent.
Yes, they are.
Come over tomorrow, and we'll discuss a strategy on how to handle them.
That sounds great.
Good night, Victoria.
Let me see Murphy's phone.
It's destroyed, thanks to you.
- And why do you want it anyway?
- To finish what you started... identify and take down the initiative.
This man was their agent.
That phone could lead us to them.
This phone could lead to my mother.
I am keeping it.
Look, the loss of your mother...
I know exactly how it feels.
But do not let it distract you from your true mission.
You are better than that.
I want you to leave.
Now.
Sorry.
I've got other instructions.
Takeda.
I thought he didn't send you.
He's lost faith.
I'm here to restore it.
So sooner or later, you're gonna have to start trusting me again.
Now... are you gonna take the head or the feet?
The head.
Leave the little stuff.
Just jewelry and cash.
Check the desk.
Hey, hey.
Oh, nice.
Hey, keep looking.
No.
No, look, we got enough.
I'm calling it.
Pfft.
To pay for four years of college?
Not all in one night and from the same house, man.
Who leaves a baseball signed by babe Ruth out in the open?
A guy who can afford another one.
I'm exhausted.
- Okay, now we call it.
Come on.
- I'm gonna check my e-mail.
Mmm.
Can't sleep?
Whoever said warm milk does the trick obviously never tasted it.
You know, pretty soon, late nights are gonna be a regular thing.
You ready?
Not until we can figure out the nursery.
I'm not doing late-night feedings by the beer taps.
All right, look...
How about this?
Declan's room... fresh coat of paint, steam clean the rugs, bring my grandma's rocking chair down from the attic.
Cheap and cheerful, just for the short term.
Or...
We can use the gift certificate
Charlotte sent us from that fancy baby store in the village and do up the room in style.
$5,000?
No, no, no.
We don't accept charity from the Graysons.
They can buy their way into the headlines.
They're not buying their way into my child's life.
Technically, Charlotte is not a Grayson.
She's a Clarke, like me, and she's excited to be an aunt.
What's the big deal?
She can be an aunt without throwing money at us.
Just...
Return the gift, Amanda.
I'll sort out the baby's room.
I've spoken to my contact at Vanity Fair and confirmed their one-on-one with Mrs. Grayson.
You're going public?
She's going nuclear.
Your mother... is inviting every vulture in the sky down for a feast, attempting to capitalize on the one thing she's never really had... sympathy.
I've come up with a list of talking points.
We're keeping it vague, avoiding the gory details, and focusing on Victoria's miraculous return.
Daniel and I don't need talking points.
We weren't involved.
- What do the authorities say?
- How will this affect their investigation?
Well, the more people who know who we're looking for, the better chance we have of finding him.
Until then, no one leaves this house, and no one addresses the press alone.
You're grounding all of us?
It's safer to stay inside until this media storm passes.
Oh, one big happy family.
Someone please pass the pain de mie.
- It's toast.
- Can you recover the contact list?
Wait.
Is that a bullet hole?
Can you fix it or not?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Won't ask, won't tell, will fix.
At least, I'll try.
- Oh!
You're actually here.
- Oh.
Ignore my text telling you to wake up.
Oh, don't we have a meeting?
We do.
You've just never shown up to one before.
Hmm.
Oh, Emily, this is Padma Lahari, my new C.F.O.
The I.R.S. is all up in Nolcorp's grill, and luckily Padma is the audit whisperer.
Hmm.
Um, Padma, this is Emily, my... uh...
My...
E...
Emily.
- Mm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a good meeting.
- Mm.
- She's very pretty.
- Mm.
How do you know her?
Oh, we cohabitate.
Well, she asked me to move out.
I...
It's extremely complicated.
Hey, get off my truck!
What the hell are you doing?
Animal shelters?
Oh, God.
Don't tell me you want a pet.
I'm looking for a place to volunteer so I don't have to spend my entire summer in this house of dysfunction.
Everyone else knows what really happened to you, Mom.
- Why can't Daniel?
- The last time push came to shove, he chose to align himself with his father.
He can't be trusted...
Yet.
You spent $5,000 at a baby store?
It's a gift for Amanda.
- She is my sister.
- Half sister, if that.
What is that supposed to mean?
Never mind.
Look, the fact that David Clarke is your father is a secret we have to guard closely for various reasons.
For now, you need to stay away from that girl.
I'm staying away from everyone.
We're sequestered, remember?
No one comes in.
No one goes out.
Well, with one notable exception.
So what story are we telling?
I certainly wouldn't want to say anything wrong to the press.
Well, the answer's simple.
You don't know anything.
You barely know us.
I was engaged to your son.
"Ever since Daniel broke it off, the Graysons have kept me at arm's length."
See?
Simple.
- And it's the truth.
- Hmm.
Victoria.
Hmm?
Are you and Charlotte safe here?
This house may as well be a fortress.
I'm talking about Conrad.
He tried to have you killed.
Oh, don't worry about Conrad.
I'll take care of him in time.
I'm more concerned about you, Emily.
And why is that?
Ever since sharing my secret, your welfare has been at risk, I'm afraid.
And the only way to ensure your safety is by cutting off all ties to my family, effective immediately.
I hate to see our newfound friendship come to an end.
But I have to ask you to stay away, permanently.
I'll have security show you home.
There's no loitering here.
You want a room, you need to come inside.
No need, ma'am.
Detective Lasky.
Southampton Police.
In a rental car?
Department cutbacks.
Have you, uh...
Have you seen this man?
He might be...
Someone that checked in a week ago.
Paid cash.
Stayed one night.
What's he wanted for?
Kidnapping.
Keep your distance.
This is a very dangerous man.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Southampton Police Department.
Southampton Police.
Yes, I need to speak with, um, Detective Lasky, please.
No one here by that name.
You might want to try the East Hampton police.
People make that mistake...
Kind of sparse for a newborn.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be if Jack had accepted Charlotte's gift.
He's determined to keep all things Grayson out of the baby's life.
Mm.
He's got good instincts.
Unfortunately, Victoria has banished me from her premises.
I need you to deliver something for me.
It's one of my father's journals, or at least my version of it.
Victoria's having a press conference.
This press pass will get you through security.
Are you nuts?
I promised Jack I wouldn't go anywhere near the Graysons.
So lie.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Show this to Charlotte to thank her for her gift.
I told you, I'm returning the gift.
I've wanted a family my whole life.
I'm not jeopardizing that for you or anyone else.
I thought we were family.
When we exchanged identities, the plan was clear.
You become my past...
And I become your future.
Turns out, I was wrong.
Looks like the future belongs to you.
Please do this for me.
I remember this dinner...
Melinda Gates and Prince, uh, something or other, at Per Se.
It's $3,000.
That's more than twice my rent.
Well, the royals love their bubbly.
Speaking of, um, are you hungry?
I suppose it's not too early to start thinking about dinner.
A working dinner, of course, which is a completely legitimate business write-off...
- Unlike 90% of the receipts I see here today.
- Oh.
Ems, hey.
How are we on the phone fix?
"Fix" may be too strong a word.
Hardware's fried.
Contacts, data, text history all bit the dust, or the bullet, as it were.
What about the SIM card?
Well, the only thing I could pull from it is the white-haired man's own number, and, well, he's not answering.
That's still helpful.
Can you get it to me?
The phone or the SIM card?
Both, as soon as possible.
Oh, I love it when you're bossy.
It means something hot's gonna happen.
So what can I look forward to?
Watch the 10:00 news.
I'm counting the hours.
Mm.
I gotta go.
Ems needs me.
- What about the...
- Oh, all this?
Oh, we can attack it tomorrow.
See ya.
Let me guess.
The Graysons found the Lindbergh Baby.
What?
The 10:00 news.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Oh, that was nothing.
I got a headline.
We took the paternity test, and it's official.
I'm...
I'm gonna be a dad.
I know.
Amanda told me.
We were just together going over some godmother stuff.
Hmm.
Congratulations.
I'm really happy for you.
Thanks.
So...
What do you think...
Yankees blue or Jets green?
Well, I think that Amanda's probably more of a football fan than a baseball fan, but...
you'll have to ask her.
I'll see you.
Emily.
Just, thank you...
For agreeing to be in this kid's life, for having my back, always, for being Amanda's friend.
It's what I signed up for.
You know, it's like you never left.
You are not welcome in this bedroom, Conrad.
Oh, so there are limits on how far you're willing to go with this charade.
You ruffled a violent man when you pulled off your double cross.
Aren't you the tiniest bit afraid that he might come for you?
Or perhaps you and he are working together even now.
To what end?
Oh, I don't know.
My destruction.
You may have trusted me enough to help with your bogus kidnapping story.
But I... don't... trust... you.
Well, that won't be an issue for you much longer, Conrad.
We may be quarantined here for a while, but come summer's end when this story runs its course,
I will be leaving you for good.
Well...
Summer's end is a long way off, my dear.
Ems?
Emily?
Uhh!
Aah!
Aiden!
Aiden, get off of him!
It's okay.
Just breathe.
Why does this keep happening to me?
- Who is that guy?
- An ally.
Nolan, where's the phone?
I told you, it's empty.
Listen...
You need to get out of here.
Come back in the morning.
I'll explain everything.
Nice meeting you...
Jerk.
Are you disappointed to see me alive?
Death by dumpster had such flair.
Seemed fitting.
I found the flight recorder from Victoria's plane.
- I thought we could make a trade.
- What do you want?
Everything the white-haired man had on him when he died.
Please.
Look, whatever you're thinking,
I'm not the enemy.
I owe you an apology.
The only thing you owe me tonight is your absence.
You made a fool of me.
That wasn't my intention.
I had to win that exercise.
Takeda would never have let me go if I had failed.
Go where?
Takeda found my sister.
I leave tonight.
But you're only halfway through your training.
It doesn't matter.
This might be my last chance.
Her last chance, so...
Look, I...
I will come back for you.
I...
I promise.
Aiden, wait.
- I'm coming with you.
- No.
It's too dangerous.
Exactly.
I've already lost everything.
I'm not losing you, too.
Meet me in the maze at midnight.
Just because you failed to save your sister doesn't mean that I'm gonna fail at finding my mother.
It's not whether you find her or not that you should be worrying about.
It's what you'll find when you do.
Good-bye, Aiden.
Any idea where you'll go?
I decline to answer as I happen to like my neck willowy and working.
Who the hell was that guy last night?
The less you know about him, the better.
Right.
- I'm gonna miss you, too, Ems.
- Nolan.
The white-haired man is dead.
His name was...
Gordon Murphy.
He had a bottle of pills on him...
Fluphenazine, an antipsychotic, one of the strongest.
Well, that fits.
He was a crazy killer.
He might have been a killer, but he wasn't crazy.
I think the pills belonged to my mother.
- That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?
- No, but I found this on him.
He knew her...
Intimately.
How can I help?
You've already done enough.
One day I will find a way to thank you.
Well...
Find her.
That'll be thanks enough.
Whoa, sailor.
You scared me.
I thought you were out, um, filing for plumbing permits.
I was.
I just, uh, I just forgot some paperwork.
You look nice.
- I'm wearing a tent.
- Shut up.
You're gorgeous.
Where you going all dressed up?
Emily is taking me shopping for, um, a changing table
- and a diaper pail.
- Without me?
- Really?
- No, not really.
Thank you for not including me, actually.
I mean that sincerely.
Thank Emily for me, too.
Although I feel like that's all I've been doing lately.
How do you mean?
Just that she's generous to a fault.
Right.
So, um, I'll be back soon.
Okay.
Have fun.
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
We've got a lot of construction going on.
We should be open inside of a couple of weeks.
I'm not looking for a drink.
You know this kid?
Yeah.
That's my brother.
Oh.
Well, we need to talk.
Emily, what are you doing here?
I'm not staying.
A press van's blocking the driveway.
I was hoping you could make an announcement.
We are minutes away from starting.
You in a hurry?
No.
No.
But, uh, Mr. Knowles across the street isn't so understanding.
I begged him to hold off calling the police until I spoke with you, but...
Thanks.
I'm on it.
Eve!
You don't want to stick around for the main event?
Your mother asked me to steer clear of your family.
I thought maybe she was speaking for you.
She wasn't.
Mr. Grayson, this arrived at the gate.
Who sent it?
Don't know, sir.
It came during a shift change.
Thank you.
"Veronica Clarke."
I should've known.
- What is it?
- Confirmation.
Of what?
Every terrible thought I've ever had about my mother.
Okay, I'm here.
What's the emergency?
I want you to meet Mr. Ryan.
Someone broke into his place the other night, and they were dumb enough to leave this behind.
What the hell were you thinking?
I...
I w...
um, I wasn't.
I saw two kids running away from my property.
- Who was with you?
- No one.
You steal from me, then call me a liar?
No, sir, but like I said, it was just me.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know what to say.
We lost our dad last year, but I swear, this isn't the way he raised us.
We can meet you down at the police station.
I'll tell you what... if the kid gives back what he took,
I won't press charges.
I was young and stupid once, too.
Careful, though.
Your next mark might not be so nice.
You come by my place tomorrow?
You know where it is.
He'll be there.
Thank you.
Listen, if there's ever anything I can do for you, you just...
just let me know.
You know what, barkeep?
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Nice going.
Hey.
- You look gorgeous.
- Amanda.
- How did you get up here?
- A sister has her ways.
My mother will freak if she knows you're up here.
Not a big fan of surprises.
I'm not afraid of her.
You shouldn't be either.
- I'm not.
- Good, 'cause if we're gonna get closer,
I...
I can't protect her anymore.
What is this?
A journal our father kept in prison.
I marked the entries that I thought you should read first.
But I have to warn you, what it says about your mother isn't pretty.
I can't imagine the fear you must have felt...
- eight weeks of torture?
- Mm-hmm.
Tell me, did you ever have a moment where you felt like giving up?
No.
The thought of never seeing my children again was far worse than anything my captor could have ever done to me.
You can call it a mother's will to survive.
More like a monster's.
I just found out the real reason you don't want me having a relationship with Amanda.
Because she knows the truth about what you did to my father.
Charlotte, this is not the time.
Who, for the record, was David Clarke.
You run that, and I will sue you for libel.
It's only libel if it isn't true.
Go ahead, Mom.
Deny it.
That's what I thought.
This interview's over.
Mom wasn't kidnapped.
She was planning to disappear.
Where did you get this?
Someone dropped it at the guard house along with that note.
She was working with him, Dad.
No, open threats are not this man's style.
If he truly wanted her dead, then she would be.
No, you're missing the larger revelation here.
Mom faked her own kidnapping.
My boy, at this moment, there are things at play that dwarf your penchant for gullibility.
Wait.
You knew about this?
Charlotte, wait.
Hey, both of you, get in here now.
Now!
You selfish, manipulative liar.
Where did this come from?
Where do you think?
Daniel, this secret was killing me.
I begged her to tell you.
You knew, too?
Don't blame her.
I can explain.
Oh, with what, more lies?
You should be begging for my forgiveness after pulling a scam like this.
You should be begging for my forgiveness, dear son.
I handed you proof of Conrad's guilt, and you chose his lies over the truth.
And the blood of every person on that government plane is on your hands as well as his.
Charlotte, whatever your mother's been telling you, pay no attention.
She's clearly not in her right mind.
And we are canceling this sham of an event.
Do that, and I will have your head on a pike.
You know, as fine as I am with a hired killer targeting you, he won't stop there, Victoria.
We're leaving the country tonight, all of us.
No, I'm through with hiding.
I'm going to put a stop to this right now, come what may.
I am so sorry for all the hell my mother put you through while we were together.
No one in their right mind would choose to live inside this family.
I despise her.
Word of advice.
Keep it to yourself.
The only way to beat your mother is to play her game better than she does.
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
We're about to begin, and please...
Amanda, wait.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were banned from the premises.
I was.
I am.
But I'm staying for this, and so are you.
No.
I already did what you asked.
Jack would kill me if he knew I was here.
And Jack would kill you if he knew that baby you're carrying isn't his.
This is that important to me.
The choice is yours.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's always been my motto that from bad comes good.
So tonight there will be no rehashing of the past... only my aspirations for the future.
Violence to one is violence to all.
And so I would like to acknowledge those close to me who have been touched by this tragedy.
She's gone off book.
She's going to tank.
- First...
- I doubt that very much.
My daughter Charlotte.
During my confinement, I promised God that if given another chance, I would live in truth.
And this starts with the biggest admission of my life.
Charlotte...
Is the blessed consequence of my affair with David Clarke.
Sweetheart, would you step up here, please?
Yes.
Conrad, you're a smart man, so I know you've been expecting this call.
Your wife's very public accusations about our agent's alleged transgression has us all deeply concerned.
A course of action has been decided, and it involves your participation.
Next, to the saint among men...
We'll be in touch.
Who forgave my infidelity and cherished Charlotte as his own...
Conrad, come.
And finally, my son Daniel, whose loyalty knows no bounds.
There is one person missing... someone who has seen more bad than good from us, and who has never been scared off.
Her tenacity I admire, and I wish to welcome her into the fold...
Along with her child...
Amanda Clarke,
Charlotte's half sister.
Amanda, please join us.
Please.
To my abductor and to anyone who thinks they can harm this family again, make no mistake, you will fail.
Mrs. Grayson!
- Understood?
- Excuse me.
This concludes the press conference.
As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no questions tonight.
Victoria!
Victoria!
My God, they're stronger than ever.
Mom.
Thank you for your show of solidarity tonight.
Your performance was flawless.
I wasn't performing.
The truth is, I'd hate myself if I'd gotten you back only to lose you again.
I'm willing to put this all behind us if you are.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
Oh, what a lovely tableau... mother and son reunited.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna check on Ashley.
Ms. Fisk, my apologies if today's event ruined our interview.
Actually, Conrad just made up for it by offering me an exclusive on your upcoming wedding.
I'm sorry if I spilled the proverbial beans, my pet.
I mean, I just...
I think I just got caught up in the whole... affair.
And Tuscany?
An exquisite place to honeymoon.
I'd expect nothing less.
- Thank you both.
Good night.
- Good night.
You should consider it a small price to pay for publicly branding me a cuckold.
I so look forward to you resuming your wifely duties, dear.
Oh, well, if that threat has any merit,
- you and I will be dead before then.
- Oh, I wouldn't bet on that.
See, I've got some breaking news of my own.
While you were dazzling the press corps,
I got a phone call from your would-be assassin's employers.
It turns out that his recent, uh, rogue and high-profile escapades have made him a target now.
So he's as good as dead, so long as we cooperate.
Oh, you fool.
You've just put us back in bed with the very architects of this entire nightmare.
Oh, Victoria.
This family has you to thank for that.
Jack?
What are you doing in here?
You and your new family were all over the news.
Did you think I wouldn't see it?
I can explain.
It's better if I do that.
My brother is the most important person in my life to me, so I get that you'd like to build a relationship with your sister.
That's exactly it, Jack.
Charlotte begged me to be there.
And if Declan needed me,
I would drop everything to be there for him, too.
It was wrong of me to try to control your relationship with the Graysons, but...
This is the last time I take ownership for your lies.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm committed to our child.
I just don't think I can commit to you.
You were right.
It's no good.
Any contacts that could've led me to the initiative were destroyed with that bullet, so I... had to go to plan "b."
You sent the passport to the Graysons to make them think the white-haired man was coming for them.
And it worked.
Conrad and the initiative are already in contact.
I had my own plan.
You could've destroyed everything.
But I didn't, did I?
Amanda Clarke is embedded in that family, and Daniel Grayson is out to ruin his mother.
Better still, he trusts you again.
You were at the house.
Oh, it was fantastic watching you capitalize on the serendipity of my actions.
Stop acting like you have my best interests at heart.
Our interests used to be one and the same.
- Aiden?
- He's gone.
Your lover has left you behind.
I don't believe you.
This is another one of your tests.
No.
No test.
Whether you believe it or not, he chose to leave you just the same.
How does it feel to have opened yourself to betrayal, same as your father?
If you want to succeed in your goal, you must learn to close your heart.
The young man you trusted understood.
Yet, still...
You do not.
I want you to leave.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry before you'll trust me again?
You have one unheard message.
To listen to your messages, press 1.
- Gordon, it's me.
- Where are you?
Um, some guy claiming to be a Detective Lasky came by with a...
a sketch, asking questions.
I...
I know what I'm supposed to do, and if I don't hear from you by tomorrow,
I'll...
I'll start shutting everything down and go dark like we promised.
Only I'm hoping I won't have to, that somehow you're still okay.
God, Gordon, please be okay.
I love you.
Previously on Revenge:
- Everybody thinks that you're dead.
- And that's the way it has to stay.
Just in time.
Your daughter's a drug addict and you're already dead.
That makes you both damn easy to dispose of.
I picked up the test results.
Nothing to worry about.
You're going to be a daddy.
Please tell me it's really his.
Sorry.
Don't pretend for one moment that you didn't try to murder me.
I warned you not to get onto that plane.
Whatever happens from this point forward stays between us.
- So what's next?
- Hit me.
- Who did this?
- You did, and if I were you, I would start running.
You once said I was like my mother.
You knew her, didn't you?
Unfortunately, that's something you'll never know.
In a race between danger and indecision, the difference between life and death... comes down to confidence.
Faith in our abilities, certainty in ourselves...
Come on.
Right ahead.
And the trust we put in others.
We're trapped.
We gotta go over.
Give me your hand.
Emily, wait.
My leg.
You okay?
Hey!
The race is won.
He cheated.
- Yes.
- He understood the exercise... to exploit your opponent's weakness.
That is the key to revenge.
Lose your compassion.
No hard feelings.
Why?
!
He wanted you dead.
I prefer you alive.
And I prefer you 10,000 miles away from here.
Tell Takeda I don't need a nanny.
- Takeda didn't send me.
- He didn't stop you either.
Are you gonna get out, or do I need to throw you out?
What you need right now is my help.
She's cleaning.
She does that when she can't sleep.
Perhaps I should give it a try.
Well, given what you've been through, insomnia seems reasonable.
I wonder what her excuse is.
You miss her, don't you?
I've spent a lot of restless nights out here, Mom.
Either you look at the ocean or Emily's house.
It's simple geography.
Besides, I'm with Ashley now.
Yet, you're still restless.
Well, it's kind of hard to sleep with all those reporters camped outside the gate and cluttering the sky.
The news hounds won't stop until they get my story.
And what exactly is your story?
Hello?
Do you know who this is?
Yes.
Not an easy voice to forget.
After the ding of the seat belt sign, the next sound you'll hear will be 14 ounces of plastic explosives detonating.
My proposition...
Conrad's demise is mutually beneficial.
All it requires is splitting Charlotte's inheritance.
Decline, and your daughter will be joining you in the Grayson family plot.
I'm listening.
And you're certain it was the white-haired man?
Of course.
Who else?
I'm just wondering how he could've boarded the plane completely undetected by ground crew.
You sound like a journalist.
Or even worse, a detective.
Detectives are still on your side last I checked.
And the implication is that you are not?
I don't know.
Gordon Murphy.
What are those?
Well, I heard what Mr. Murphy here said about disobeying the order to kill your mother.
That doesn't mean that somebody else didn't finish the job.
You going to answer your phone?
Victoria.
Don't think me intrusive, but I see that you're awake.
I was just turning in.
Well, I thought the events of the day might be keeping you up.
No, it's the reporters that keep knocking on my door.
They saw me leaving Grayson Manor earlier.
They want to know everything.
Well, I trust you staved them off.
So far.
But they are persistent.
Yes, they are.
Come over tomorrow, and we'll discuss a strategy on how to handle them.
That sounds great.
Good night, Victoria.
Let me see Murphy's phone.
It's destroyed, thanks to you.
- And why do you want it anyway?
- To finish what you started... identify and take down the initiative.
This man was their agent.
That phone could lead us to them.
This phone could lead to my mother.
I am keeping it.
Look, the loss of your mother...
I know exactly how it feels.
But do not let it distract you from your true mission.
You are better than that.
I want you to leave.
Now.
Sorry.
I've got other instructions.
Takeda.
I thought he didn't send you.
He's lost faith.
I'm here to restore it.
So sooner or later, you're gonna have to start trusting me again.
Now... are you gonna take the head or the feet?
The head.
Leave the little stuff.
Just jewelry and cash.
Check the desk.
Hey, hey.
Oh, nice.
Hey, keep looking.
No.
No, look, we got enough.
I'm calling it.
Pfft.
To pay for four years of college?
Not all in one night and from the same house, man.
Who leaves a baseball signed by babe Ruth out in the open?
A guy who can afford another one.
I'm exhausted.
- Okay, now we call it.
Come on.
- I'm gonna check my e-mail.
Mmm.
Can't sleep?
Whoever said warm milk does the trick obviously never tasted it.
You know, pretty soon, late nights are gonna be a regular thing.
You ready?
Not until we can figure out the nursery.
I'm not doing late-night feedings by the beer taps.
All right, look...
How about this?
Declan's room... fresh coat of paint, steam clean the rugs, bring my grandma's rocking chair down from the attic.
Cheap and cheerful, just for the short term.
Or...
We can use the gift certificate
Charlotte sent us from that fancy baby store in the village and do up the room in style.
$5,000?
No, no, no.
We don't accept charity from the Graysons.
They can buy their way into the headlines.
They're not buying their way into my child's life.
Technically, Charlotte is not a Grayson.
She's a Clarke, like me, and she's excited to be an aunt.
What's the big deal?
She can be an aunt without throwing money at us.
Just...
Return the gift, Amanda.
I'll sort out the baby's room.
I've spoken to my contact at Vanity Fair and confirmed their one-on-one with Mrs. Grayson.
You're going public?
She's going nuclear.
Your mother... is inviting every vulture in the sky down for a feast, attempting to capitalize on the one thing she's never really had... sympathy.
I've come up with a list of talking points.
We're keeping it vague, avoiding the gory details, and focusing on Victoria's miraculous return.
Daniel and I don't need talking points.
We weren't involved.
- What do the authorities say?
- How will this affect their investigation?
Well, the more people who know who we're looking for, the better chance we have of finding him.
Until then, no one leaves this house, and no one addresses the press alone.
You're grounding all of us?
It's safer to stay inside until this media storm passes.
Oh, one big happy family.
Someone please pass the pain de mie.
- It's toast.
- Can you recover the contact list?
Wait.
Is that a bullet hole?
Can you fix it or not?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Won't ask, won't tell, will fix.
At least, I'll try.
- Oh!
You're actually here.
- Oh.
Ignore my text telling you to wake up.
Oh, don't we have a meeting?
We do.
You've just never shown up to one before.
Hmm.
Oh, Emily, this is Padma Lahari, my new C.F.O.
The I.R.S. is all up in Nolcorp's grill, and luckily Padma is the audit whisperer.
Hmm.
Um, Padma, this is Emily, my... uh...
My...
E...
Emily.
- Mm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a good meeting.
- Mm.
- She's very pretty.
- Mm.
How do you know her?
Oh, we cohabitate.
Well, she asked me to move out.
I...
It's extremely complicated.
Hey, get off my truck!
What the hell are you doing?
Animal shelters?
Oh, God.
Don't tell me you want a pet.
I'm looking for a place to volunteer so I don't have to spend my entire summer in this house of dysfunction.
Everyone else knows what really happened to you, Mom.
- Why can't Daniel?
- The last time push came to shove, he chose to align himself with his father.
He can't be trusted...
Yet.
You spent $5,000 at a baby store?
It's a gift for Amanda.
- She is my sister.
- Half sister, if that.
What is that supposed to mean?
Never mind.
Look, the fact that David Clarke is your father is a secret we have to guard closely for various reasons.
For now, you need to stay away from that girl.
I'm staying away from everyone.
We're sequestered, remember?
No one comes in.
No one goes out.
Well, with one notable exception.
So what story are we telling?
I certainly wouldn't want to say anything wrong to the press.
Well, the answer's simple.
You don't know anything.
You barely know us.
I was engaged to your son.
"Ever since Daniel broke it off, the Graysons have kept me at arm's length."
See?
Simple.
- And it's the truth.
- Hmm.
Victoria.
Hmm?
Are you and Charlotte safe here?
This house may as well be a fortress.
I'm talking about Conrad.
He tried to have you killed.
Oh, don't worry about Conrad.
I'll take care of him in time.
I'm more concerned about you, Emily.
And why is that?
Ever since sharing my secret, your welfare has been at risk, I'm afraid.
And the only way to ensure your safety is by cutting off all ties to my family, effective immediately.
I hate to see our newfound friendship come to an end.
But I have to ask you to stay away, permanently.
I'll have security show you home.
There's no loitering here.
You want a room, you need to come inside.
No need, ma'am.
Detective Lasky.
Southampton Police.
In a rental car?
Department cutbacks.
Have you, uh...
Have you seen this man?
He might be...
Someone that checked in a week ago.
Paid cash.
Stayed one night.
What's he wanted for?
Kidnapping.
Keep your distance.
This is a very dangerous man.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Southampton Police Department.
Southampton Police.
Yes, I need to speak with, um, Detective Lasky, please.
No one here by that name.
You might want to try the East Hampton police.
People make that mistake...
Kind of sparse for a newborn.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be if Jack had accepted Charlotte's gift.
He's determined to keep all things Grayson out of the baby's life.
Mm.
He's got good instincts.
Unfortunately, Victoria has banished me from her premises.
I need you to deliver something for me.
It's one of my father's journals, or at least my version of it.
Victoria's having a press conference.
This press pass will get you through security.
Are you nuts?
I promised Jack I wouldn't go anywhere near the Graysons.
So lie.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Show this to Charlotte to thank her for her gift.
I told you, I'm returning the gift.
I've wanted a family my whole life.
I'm not jeopardizing that for you or anyone else.
I thought we were family.
When we exchanged identities, the plan was clear.
You become my past...
And I become your future.
Turns out, I was wrong.
Looks like the future belongs to you.
Please do this for me.
I remember this dinner...
Melinda Gates and Prince, uh, something or other, at Per Se.
It's $3,000.
That's more than twice my rent.
Well, the royals love their bubbly.
Speaking of, um, are you hungry?
I suppose it's not too early to start thinking about dinner.
A working dinner, of course, which is a completely legitimate business write-off...
- Unlike 90% of the receipts I see here today.
- Oh.
Ems, hey.
How are we on the phone fix?
"Fix" may be too strong a word.
Hardware's fried.
Contacts, data, text history all bit the dust, or the bullet, as it were.
What about the SIM card?
Well, the only thing I could pull from it is the white-haired man's own number, and, well, he's not answering.
That's still helpful.
Can you get it to me?
The phone or the SIM card?
Both, as soon as possible.
Oh, I love it when you're bossy.
It means something hot's gonna happen.
So what can I look forward to?
Watch the 10:00 news.
I'm counting the hours.
Mm.
I gotta go.
Ems needs me.
- What about the...
- Oh, all this?
Oh, we can attack it tomorrow.
See ya.
Let me guess.
The Graysons found the Lindbergh Baby.
What?
The 10:00 news.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Oh, that was nothing.
I got a headline.
We took the paternity test, and it's official.
I'm...
I'm gonna be a dad.
I know.
Amanda told me.
We were just together going over some godmother stuff.
Hmm.
Congratulations.
I'm really happy for you.
Thanks.
So...
What do you think...
Yankees blue or Jets green?
Well, I think that Amanda's probably more of a football fan than a baseball fan, but...
you'll have to ask her.
I'll see you.
Emily.
Just, thank you...
For agreeing to be in this kid's life, for having my back, always, for being Amanda's friend.
It's what I signed up for.
You know, it's like you never left.
You are not welcome in this bedroom, Conrad.
Oh, so there are limits on how far you're willing to go with this charade.
You ruffled a violent man when you pulled off your double cross.
Aren't you the tiniest bit afraid that he might come for you?
Or perhaps you and he are working together even now.
To what end?
Oh, I don't know.
My destruction.
You may have trusted me enough to help with your bogus kidnapping story.
But I... don't... trust... you.
Well, that won't be an issue for you much longer, Conrad.
We may be quarantined here for a while, but come summer's end when this story runs its course,
I will be leaving you for good.
Well...
Summer's end is a long way off, my dear.
Ems?
Emily?
Uhh!
Aah!
Aiden!
Aiden, get off of him!
It's okay.
Just breathe.
Why does this keep happening to me?
- Who is that guy?
- An ally.
Nolan, where's the phone?
I told you, it's empty.
Listen...
You need to get out of here.
Come back in the morning.
I'll explain everything.
Nice meeting you...
Jerk.
Are you disappointed to see me alive?
Death by dumpster had such flair.
Seemed fitting.
I found the flight recorder from Victoria's plane.
- I thought we could make a trade.
- What do you want?
Everything the white-haired man had on him when he died.
Please.
Look, whatever you're thinking,
I'm not the enemy.
I owe you an apology.
The only thing you owe me tonight is your absence.
You made a fool of me.
That wasn't my intention.
I had to win that exercise.
Takeda would never have let me go if I had failed.
Go where?
Takeda found my sister.
I leave tonight.
But you're only halfway through your training.
It doesn't matter.
This might be my last chance.
Her last chance, so...
Look, I...
I will come back for you.
I...
I promise.
Aiden, wait.
- I'm coming with you.
- No.
It's too dangerous.
Exactly.
I've already lost everything.
I'm not losing you, too.
Meet me in the maze at midnight.
Just because you failed to save your sister doesn't mean that I'm gonna fail at finding my mother.
It's not whether you find her or not that you should be worrying about.
It's what you'll find when you do.
Good-bye, Aiden.
Any idea where you'll go?
I decline to answer as I happen to like my neck willowy and working.
Who the hell was that guy last night?
The less you know about him, the better.
Right.
- I'm gonna miss you, too, Ems.
- Nolan.
The white-haired man is dead.
His name was...
Gordon Murphy.
He had a bottle of pills on him...
Fluphenazine, an antipsychotic, one of the strongest.
Well, that fits.
He was a crazy killer.
He might have been a killer, but he wasn't crazy.
I think the pills belonged to my mother.
- That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?
- No, but I found this on him.
He knew her...
Intimately.
How can I help?
You've already done enough.
One day I will find a way to thank you.
Well...
Find her.
That'll be thanks enough.
Whoa, sailor.
You scared me.
I thought you were out, um, filing for plumbing permits.
I was.
I just, uh, I just forgot some paperwork.
You look nice.
- I'm wearing a tent.
- Shut up.
You're gorgeous.
Where you going all dressed up?
Emily is taking me shopping for, um, a changing table
- and a diaper pail.
- Without me?
- Really?
- No, not really.
Thank you for not including me, actually.
I mean that sincerely.
Thank Emily for me, too.
Although I feel like that's all I've been doing lately.
How do you mean?
Just that she's generous to a fault.
Right.
So, um, I'll be back soon.
Okay.
Have fun.
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
We've got a lot of construction going on.
We should be open inside of a couple of weeks.
I'm not looking for a drink.
You know this kid?
Yeah.
That's my brother.
Oh.
Well, we need to talk.
Emily, what are you doing here?
I'm not staying.
A press van's blocking the driveway.
I was hoping you could make an announcement.
We are minutes away from starting.
You in a hurry?
No.
No.
But, uh, Mr. Knowles across the street isn't so understanding.
I begged him to hold off calling the police until I spoke with you, but...
Thanks.
I'm on it.
Eve!
You don't want to stick around for the main event?
Your mother asked me to steer clear of your family.
I thought maybe she was speaking for you.
She wasn't.
Mr. Grayson, this arrived at the gate.
Who sent it?
Don't know, sir.
It came during a shift change.
Thank you.
"Veronica Clarke."
I should've known.
- What is it?
- Confirmation.
Of what?
Every terrible thought I've ever had about my mother.
Okay, I'm here.
What's the emergency?
I want you to meet Mr. Ryan.
Someone broke into his place the other night, and they were dumb enough to leave this behind.
What the hell were you thinking?
I...
I w...
um, I wasn't.
I saw two kids running away from my property.
- Who was with you?
- No one.
You steal from me, then call me a liar?
No, sir, but like I said, it was just me.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know what to say.
We lost our dad last year, but I swear, this isn't the way he raised us.
We can meet you down at the police station.
I'll tell you what... if the kid gives back what he took,
I won't press charges.
I was young and stupid once, too.
Careful, though.
Your next mark might not be so nice.
You come by my place tomorrow?
You know where it is.
He'll be there.
Thank you.
Listen, if there's ever anything I can do for you, you just...
just let me know.
You know what, barkeep?
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Nice going.
Hey.
- You look gorgeous.
- Amanda.
- How did you get up here?
- A sister has her ways.
My mother will freak if she knows you're up here.
Not a big fan of surprises.
I'm not afraid of her.
You shouldn't be either.
- I'm not.
- Good, 'cause if we're gonna get closer,
I...
I can't protect her anymore.
What is this?
A journal our father kept in prison.
I marked the entries that I thought you should read first.
But I have to warn you, what it says about your mother isn't pretty.
I can't imagine the fear you must have felt...
- eight weeks of torture?
- Mm-hmm.
Tell me, did you ever have a moment where you felt like giving up?
No.
The thought of never seeing my children again was far worse than anything my captor could have ever done to me.
You can call it a mother's will to survive.
More like a monster's.
I just found out the real reason you don't want me having a relationship with Amanda.
Because she knows the truth about what you did to my father.
Charlotte, this is not the time.
Who, for the record, was David Clarke.
You run that, and I will sue you for libel.
It's only libel if it isn't true.
Go ahead, Mom.
Deny it.
That's what I thought.
This interview's over.
Mom wasn't kidnapped.
She was planning to disappear.
Where did you get this?
Someone dropped it at the guard house along with that note.
She was working with him, Dad.
No, open threats are not this man's style.
If he truly wanted her dead, then she would be.
No, you're missing the larger revelation here.
Mom faked her own kidnapping.
My boy, at this moment, there are things at play that dwarf your penchant for gullibility.
Wait.
You knew about this?
Charlotte, wait.
Hey, both of you, get in here now.
Now!
You selfish, manipulative liar.
Where did this come from?
Where do you think?
Daniel, this secret was killing me.
I begged her to tell you.
You knew, too?
Don't blame her.
I can explain.
Oh, with what, more lies?
You should be begging for my forgiveness after pulling a scam like this.
You should be begging for my forgiveness, dear son.
I handed you proof of Conrad's guilt, and you chose his lies over the truth.
And the blood of every person on that government plane is on your hands as well as his.
Charlotte, whatever your mother's been telling you, pay no attention.
She's clearly not in her right mind.
And we are canceling this sham of an event.
Do that, and I will have your head on a pike.
You know, as fine as I am with a hired killer targeting you, he won't stop there, Victoria.
We're leaving the country tonight, all of us.
No, I'm through with hiding.
I'm going to put a stop to this right now, come what may.
I am so sorry for all the hell my mother put you through while we were together.
No one in their right mind would choose to live inside this family.
I despise her.
Word of advice.
Keep it to yourself.
The only way to beat your mother is to play her game better than she does.
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
We're about to begin, and please...
Amanda, wait.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were banned from the premises.
I was.
I am.
But I'm staying for this, and so are you.
No.
I already did what you asked.
Jack would kill me if he knew I was here.
And Jack would kill you if he knew that baby you're carrying isn't his.
This is that important to me.
The choice is yours.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's always been my motto that from bad comes good.
So tonight there will be no rehashing of the past... only my aspirations for the future.
Violence to one is violence to all.
And so I would like to acknowledge those close to me who have been touched by this tragedy.
She's gone off book.
She's going to tank.
- First...
- I doubt that very much.
My daughter Charlotte.
During my confinement, I promised God that if given another chance, I would live in truth.
And this starts with the biggest admission of my life.
Charlotte...
Is the blessed consequence of my affair with David Clarke.
Sweetheart, would you step up here, please?
Yes.
Conrad, you're a smart man, so I know you've been expecting this call.
Your wife's very public accusations about our agent's alleged transgression has us all deeply concerned.
A course of action has been decided, and it involves your participation.
Next, to the saint among men...
We'll be in touch.
Who forgave my infidelity and cherished Charlotte as his own...
Conrad, come.
And finally, my son Daniel, whose loyalty knows no bounds.
There is one person missing... someone who has seen more bad than good from us, and who has never been scared off.
Her tenacity I admire, and I wish to welcome her into the fold...
Along with her child...
Amanda Clarke,
Charlotte's half sister.
Amanda, please join us.
Please.
To my abductor and to anyone who thinks they can harm this family again, make no mistake, you will fail.
Mrs. Grayson!
- Understood?
- Excuse me.
This concludes the press conference.
As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no questions tonight.
Victoria!
Victoria!
My God, they're stronger than ever.
Mom.
Thank you for your show of solidarity tonight.
Your performance was flawless.
I wasn't performing.
The truth is, I'd hate myself if I'd gotten you back only to lose you again.
I'm willing to put this all behind us if you are.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
Oh, what a lovely tableau... mother and son reunited.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna check on Ashley.
Ms. Fisk, my apologies if today's event ruined our interview.
Actually, Conrad just made up for it by offering me an exclusive on your upcoming wedding.
I'm sorry if I spilled the proverbial beans, my pet.
I mean, I just...
I think I just got caught up in the whole... affair.
And Tuscany?
An exquisite place to honeymoon.
I'd expect nothing less.
- Thank you both.
Good night.
- Good night.
You should consider it a small price to pay for publicly branding me a cuckold.
I so look forward to you resuming your wifely duties, dear.
Oh, well, if that threat has any merit,
- you and I will be dead before then.
- Oh, I wouldn't bet on that.
See, I've got some breaking news of my own.
While you were dazzling the press corps,
I got a phone call from your would-be assassin's employers.
It turns out that his recent, uh, rogue and high-profile escapades have made him a target now.
So he's as good as dead, so long as we cooperate.
Oh, you fool.
You've just put us back in bed with the very architects of this entire nightmare.
Oh, Victoria.
This family has you to thank for that.
Jack?
What are you doing in here?
You and your new family were all over the news.
Did you think I wouldn't see it?
I can explain.
It's better if I do that.
My brother is the most important person in my life to me, so I get that you'd like to build a relationship with your sister.
That's exactly it, Jack.
Charlotte begged me to be there.
And if Declan needed me,
I would drop everything to be there for him, too.
It was wrong of me to try to control your relationship with the Graysons, but...
This is the last time I take ownership for your lies.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm committed to our child.
I just don't think I can commit to you.
You were right.
It's no good.
Any contacts that could've led me to the initiative were destroyed with that bullet, so I... had to go to plan "b."
You sent the passport to the Graysons to make them think the white-haired man was coming for them.
And it worked.
Conrad and the initiative are already in contact.
I had my own plan.
You could've destroyed everything.
But I didn't, did I?
Amanda Clarke is embedded in that family, and Daniel Grayson is out to ruin his mother.
Better still, he trusts you again.
You were at the house.
Oh, it was fantastic watching you capitalize on the serendipity of my actions.
Stop acting like you have my best interests at heart.
Our interests used to be one and the same.
- Aiden?
- He's gone.
Your lover has left you behind.
I don't believe you.
This is another one of your tests.
No.
No test.
Whether you believe it or not, he chose to leave you just the same.
How does it feel to have opened yourself to betrayal, same as your father?
If you want to succeed in your goal, you must learn to close your heart.
The young man you trusted understood.
Yet, still...
You do not.
I want you to leave.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry before you'll trust me again?
You have one unheard message.
To listen to your messages, press 1.
- Gordon, it's me.
- Where are you?
Um, some guy claiming to be a Detective Lasky came by with a...
a sketch, asking questions.
I...
I know what I'm supposed to do, and if I don't hear from you by tomorrow,
I'll...
I'll start shutting everything down and go dark like we promised.
Only I'm hoping I won't have to, that somehow you're still okay.
God, Gordon, please be okay.
I love you.
Previously on Revenge:
- Everybody thinks that you're dead.
- And that's the way it has to stay.
Just in time.
Your daughter's a drug addict and you're already dead.
That makes you both damn easy to dispose of.
I picked up the test results.
Nothing to worry about.
You're going to be a daddy.
Please tell me it's really his.
Sorry.
Don't pretend for one moment that you didn't try to murder me.
I warned you not to get onto that plane.
Whatever happens from this point forward stays between us.
- So what's next?
- Hit me.
- Who did this?
- You did, and if I were you, I would start running.
{Siren wailing}
You once said I was like my mother.
You knew her, didn't you?
Unfortunately, that's something you'll never know.
Ina racebetween danger and indecision, the difference between life and death...
comes down to confidence.
Faith in our abilities, certainty in ourselves...
{Dogs continue barking}
Come on.
Right ahead.
{Barking continues}
And the trust we put in others.
We'retrapped.
{Barking continues}
We gotta go over.
{Barking continues}
Give me your hand.
Emily, wait.
My leg.
You okay?
Hey!
The race is won.
He cheated.
Yes.
He understood the exercise... to exploit your opponent's weakness.
That is the key to revenge.
Lose your compassion.
No hard feelings.
Why?
!
He wanted you dead.
{Knife clicks closed} I prefer you alive.
And I prefer you 10,000 miles away from here.
Tell Takeda I don't need a nanny.
- Takeda didn't send me.
- He didn't stop you either.
Are you gonna get out, or do I need to throw you out?
What you need right now is my help.
She'scleaning.
She does that when she can't sleep.
Perhaps I should give it a try.
Well, given what you've been through, insomnia seems reasonable.
I wonder what her excuse is.
{Waves crashing}
You miss her, don't you?
I've spent a lot of restless nights out here, Mom.
Either you look at the ocean or Emily's house.
It's simple geography.
Besides, I'm with Ashley now.
Yet, you're still restless.
{Helicopter whirring overhead}
Well, it's kind of hard to sleep with all those reporters camped outside the gate and cluttering the sky.
The news hounds won't stop until they get my story.
And what exactly is your story?
{Cell phone rings}
Hello?
{White-haired man} Do you know who this is?
Yes.
Not an easy voice to forget.
After the ding of the seat belt sign, the next sound you'll hear will be 14 ounces of plastic explosives detonating.
My proposition...
Conrad's demise is mutually beneficial.
All it requires is splitting Charlotte's inheritance.
Decline, and your daughter will be joining you in the Grayson family plot.
I'm listening.
And you're certain it was the white-haired man?
Of course.
Who else?
I'm just wondering how he could've boarded the plane completely undetected by ground crew.
You sound like a journalist.
Or even worse, a detective.
Detectives are still on your side last I checked.
And the implication is that you are not?
I don't know.
Gordon Murphy.
{Pills rattle} What are those?
Well, I heard what Mr. Murphy here said about disobeying the order to kill your mother.
That doesn't mean that somebody else didn't finish the job.
{Cell phone ringing}
You going to answer your phone?
{Ring, beep}
Victoria.
Don't think me intrusive, but I see that you're awake.
I was just turning in.
Well, I thought the events of the day might be keeping you up.
No, it's the reporters that keep knocking on my door.
They saw me leaving Grayson Manor earlier.
They want to know everything.
Well, I trust you staved them off.
So far.
But they are persistent.
Yes, they are.
Come over tomorrow, and we'll discuss a strategy on how to handle them.
That sounds great.
Good night, Victoria.
Let me see Murphy's phone.
It's destroyed, thanks to you.
- And why do you want it anyway?
- To finish what you started... identify and take down the initiative.
This man was their agent.
That phone could lead us to them.
This phone could lead to my mother.
I am keeping it.
Look, the loss of your mother...
I know exactly how it feels.
But do not let it distract you from your true mission.
You are better than that.
I want you to leave.
Now.
Sorry.
I've got other instructions.
Takeda.
I thought he didn't send you.
He's lost faith.
I'm here to restore it.
So sooner or later, you're gonna have to start trusting me again.
Now... are you gonna take the head or the feet?
The head.
{Lowered voice} Leave the little stuff.
Just jewelry and cash.
Check the desk.
{Lowered voice} Hey, hey.
Oh, nice.
Hey, keep looking.
No.
No, look, we got enough.
I'm calling it.
Pfft.
To pay for four years of college?
Not all in one night and from the same house, man.
Who leaves a baseball signed by babe Ruth out in the open?
A guy who can afford another one.
{Switch clicks} I'mexhausted.
- Okay, now we call it.
Come on.
- I'm gonna check my e-mail.
Mmm.
Can't sleep?
Whoever said warm milk does the trick obviously never tasted it.
You know, pretty soon, late nights are gonna be a regular thing.
You ready?
Not until we can figure out the nursery.
I'm not doing late-night feedings by the beer taps.
All right, look...
{Blows air}
How about this?
Declan's room... fresh coat of paint, steam clean the rugs, bring my grandma's rocking chair down from the attic.
Cheap and cheerful, just for the short term.
Or...
We can use the gift certificate
Charlotte sent us from that fancy baby store in the village and do up the room in style.
$5,000?
No, no, no.
We don't accept charity from the Graysons.
They can buy their way into the headlines.
They're not buying their way into my child's life.
Technically, Charlotte is not a Grayson.
She's a Clarke, like me, and she's excited to be an aunt.
What's the big deal?
She can be an aunt without throwing money at us.
Just...
Return the gift, Amanda.
I'll sort out the baby's room.
I've spoken to my contact at Vanity Fair and confirmed their one-on-one with Mrs. Grayson.
You're going public?
She's going nuclear.
Your mother... is inviting every vulture in the sky down for a feast, attempting to capitalize on the one thing she's never really had... sympathy.
I'vecomeup with a list of talking points.
We're keeping it vague, avoiding the gory details, and focusing on Victoria's miraculous return.
Daniel and I don't need talking points.
We weren't involved.
Whatdotheauthoritiessay?
How will this affect their investigation?
Well,themorepeople who know who we're looking for, the better chance we have of finding him.
Until then, no one leaves this house, and no one addresses the press alone.
You're grounding all of us?
It's safer to stay inside until this media storm passes.
Oh, one big happy family.
Someone please pass the pain de mie.
- It's toast.
- Can you recover the contact list?
Wait.
Is that a bullet hole?
Can you fix it or not?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Won't ask, won't tell, will fix.
At least, I'll try.
- Oh!
You're actually here.
- Oh.
Ignore my text telling you to wake up.
Oh, don't we have a meeting?
We do.
You've just never shown up to one before.
Hmm.
Oh, Emily, this is Padma Lahari, my new C.F.O.
The I.R.S. is all up in Nolcorp's grill, and luckily Padma is the audit whisperer.
Hmm.
Um, Padma, this is Emily, my... uh... {Telephone rings}
My...
E...
Emily.
- Mm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a good meeting.
- Mm.
- She's very pretty.
- Mm.
How do you know her?
Oh, we cohabitate.
Well, she asked me to move out.
I...
It's extremely complicated.
Hey, get off my truck!
What the hell are you doing?
{Keys jangle}
Animal shelters?
Oh, God.
Don't tell me you want a pet.
I'm looking for a place to volunteer so I don't have to spend my entire summer in this house of dysfunction.
Everyone else knows what really happened to you, Mom.
- Why can't Daniel?
- The last time push came to shove, he chose to align himself with his father.
He can't be trusted...
Yet.
{Paper rustles}
You spent $5,000 at a baby store?
It's a gift for Amanda.
- She is my sister.
- Half sister, if that.
What is that supposed to mean?
Never mind.
{Sets down paper}
Look, the fact that David Clarke is your father is a secret we have to guard closely for various reasons.
For now, you need to stay away from that girl.
I'm staying away from everyone.
We're sequestered, remember?
No one comes in.
No one goes out.
Well, with one notable exception.
Sowhatstory are we telling?
I certainly wouldn't want to say anything wrong to the press.
Well, the answer's simple.
You don't know anything.
You barely know us.
I was engaged to your son.
"Ever since Daniel broke it off, the Graysons have kept me at arm's length."
See?
Simple.
- And it's the truth.
- Hmm.
{Sets down cup}
Victoria.
Hmm?
Are you and Charlotte safe here?
This house may as well be a fortress.
I'm talking about Conrad.
He tried to have you killed.
Oh, don't worry about Conrad.
I'll take care of him in time.
I'm more concerned about you, Emily.
And why is that?
Ever since sharing my secret, your welfare has been at risk, I'm afraid.
And the only way to ensure your safety is by cutting off all ties to my family, effective immediately.
I hate to see our newfound friendship come to an end.
But I have to ask you to stay away, permanently.
I'll have security show you home.
{Sets down cup}
{Birds chirping}
{Doorknob clicking}
{Door creaks}
There's no loitering here.
You want a room, you need to come inside.
{American accent} No need, ma'am.
Detective Lasky.
Southampton Police.
In a rental car?
Department cutbacks.
Have you, uh...
Have you seen this man?
He might be...
Someone that checked in a week ago.
Paid cash.
Stayed one night.
What's he wanted for?
Kidnapping.
Keep your distance.
This is a very dangerous man.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
{Dials cell phone}
{Phone rings}
Southampton Police Department.
SouthamptonPolice.
{Engine starts}
Yes, I need to speak with, um, Detective Lasky, please.
No one here by that name.
You might want to try the East Hampton police.
People make that mistake...
{Seagull calling}
Kind of sparse for a newborn.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be if Jack had accepted Charlotte's gift.
He's determined to keep all things Grayson out of the baby's life.
Mm.
He's got good instincts.
Unfortunately, Victoria has banished me from her premises.
I need you to deliver something for me.
It's one of my father's journals, or at least my version of it.
Victoria's having a press conference.
This press pass will get you through security.
Are you nuts?
I promised Jack I wouldn't go anywhere near the Graysons.
So lie.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Show this to Charlotte to thank her for her gift.
I told you, I'm returning the gift.
I've wanted a family my whole life.
I'm not jeopardizing that for you or anyone else.
I thought we were family.
When we exchanged identities, the plan was clear.
You become my past...
And I become your future.
Turns out, I was wrong.
Looks like the future belongs to you.
Please do this for me.
I remember this dinner...
Melinda Gates and Prince, uh, something or other, at Per Se.
It's $3,000.
That's more than twice my rent.
Well, the royals love their bubbly.
Speaking of, um, are you hungry?
I suppose it's not too early to start thinking about dinner.
A working dinner, of course, which is a completely legitimate business write-off... {Cell phone ringing}
- Unlike 90% of the receipts I see here today.
- Oh.
Ems, hey.
How are we on the phone fix?
"Fix" may be too strong a word.
Hardware's fried.
Contacts, data, text history all bit the dust, or the bullet, as it were.
What about the SIM card?
Well, the only thing I could pull from it is the white-haired man's own number, and, well, he's not answering.
That's still helpful.
Can you get it to me?
The phone or the SIM card?
Both, as soon as possible.
Oh, I love it when you're bossy.
It means something hot's gonna happen.
So what can I look forward to?
Watch the 10:00 news.
I'm counting the hours.
Mm.
I gotta go.
Ems needs me.
- What about the...
- Oh, all this?
Oh, we can attack it tomorrow.
See ya.
Let me guess.
The Graysons found the Lindbergh Baby.
What?
The 10:00 news.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Oh, that was nothing.
I got a headline.
We took the paternity test, and it's official.
I'm...
I'm gonna be a dad.
I know.
Amanda told me.
We were just together going over some godmother stuff.
Hmm.
Congratulations.
I'm really happy for you.
Thanks.
{Clears throat} So...
What do you think...
Yankees blue or Jets green?
Well, I think that Amanda's probably more of a football fan than a baseball fan, but...
you'll have to ask her.
I'll see you.
Emily.
Just, thank you...
For agreeing to be in this kid's life, for having my back, always, for being Amanda's friend.
It's what I signed up for.
You know, it's like you never left.
You are not welcome in this bedroom, Conrad.
Oh, so there are limits on how far you're willing to go with this charade.
You ruffled a violent man when you pulled off your double cross.
Aren't you the tiniest bit afraid that he might come for you?
Or perhaps you and he are working together even now.
To what end?
Oh, I don't know.
My destruction.
You may have trusted me enough to help with your bogus kidnapping story.
But I... don't... trust... you.
Well, that won't be an issue for you much longer, Conrad.
We may be quarantined here for a while, but come summer's end when this story runs its course,
I will be leaving you for good.
Well...
Summer's end is a long way off, my dear.
Ems?
Emily?
Uhh!
Aah!
{Both grunting}
Aiden!
Aiden, get off of him!
{Groans and coughs}
It'sokay.
Just breathe.
Why does this keep happening to me?
- Who is that guy?
- An ally.
Nolan, where's the phone?
I told you, it's empty.
Listen...
You need to get out of here.
Come back in the morning.
I'll explain everything.
Nicemeetingyou...
Jerk.
{Door closes}
Are you disappointed to see me alive?
Death by dumpster had such flair.
Seemed fitting.
I found the flight recorder from Victoria's plane.
- I thought we could make a trade.
- What do you want?
Everything the white-haired man had on him when he died.
Please.
{Closes panel}
Look, whatever you're thinking,
I'm not the enemy.
I owe you an apology.
The only thing you owe me tonight is your absence.
You made a fool of me.
That wasn't my intention.
I had to win that exercise.
Takeda would never have let me go if I had failed.
Go where?
Takeda found my sister.
I leave tonight.
But you're only halfway through your training.
It doesn't matter.
This might be my last chance.
Her last chance, so...
Look, I...
I will come back for you.
I...
I promise.
Aiden, wait.
- I'm coming with you.
- No.
It's too dangerous.
Exactly.
I've already lost everything.
I'm not losing you, too.
Meet me in the maze at midnight.
Just because you failed to save your sister doesn't me that I'm gonna fail at finding my mother.
It's not whether you find her or not that you should be worrying about.
It's what you'll find when you do.
Good-bye, Aiden.
Any idea where you'll go?
I decline to answer as I happen to like my neck willowy and working.
Who the hell was that guy last night?
The less you know about him, the better.
Right.
- I'm gonna miss you, too, Ems.
- Nolan.
The white-haired man is dead.
His name was...
Gordon Murphy.
He had a bottle of pills on him...
Fluphenazine, an antipsychotic, one of the strongest.
Well, that fits.
He was a crazy killer.
He might have been a killer, but he wasn't crazy.
I think the pills belonged to my mother.
- That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?
- No, but I found this on him.
He knew her...
Intimately.
How can I help?
{Pocket watch snaps shut} You've already done enough.
One day I will find a way to thank you.
Well...
Find her.
That'll be thanks enough.
{Door opens}
Whoa, sailor.
You scared me.
I thought you were out, um, filing for plumbing permits.
I was.
I just, uh, I just forgot some paperwork.
You look nice.
- I'm wearing a tent.
- Shut up.
You're gorgeous.
Where you going all dressed up?
Emily is taking me shopping for, um, a changing table
- and a diaper pail.
- Without me?
- Really?
- No, not really.
Thank you for not including me, actually.
I mean that sincerely.
Thank Emily for me, too.
Although I feel like that's all I've been doing lately.
How do you mean?
Just that she's generous to a fault.
Right.
So, um, I'll be back soon.
Okay.
Have fun.
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
We've got a lot of construction going on.
We should be open inside of a couple of weeks.
I'm not looking for a drink.
You know this kid?
Yeah.
That's my brother.
Oh.
Well, we need to talk.
Emily, what are you doing here?
I'm not staying.
A press van's blocking the driveway.
I was hoping you could make an announcement.
We are minutes away from starting.
You in a hurry?
No.
No.
But, uh, Mr. Knowles across the street isn't so understanding.
I begged him to hold off calling the police until I spoke with you, but...
Thanks.
I'm on it.
Eve!
You don't want to stick around for the main event?
Your mother asked me to steer clear of your family.
I thought maybe she was speaking for you.
She wasn't.
Mr. Grayson, this arrived at the gate.
Who sent it?
Don't know, sir.
It came during a shift change.
Thank you.
"Veronica Clarke."
I should've known.
- What is it?
- Confirmation.
Of what?
Every terrible thought I've ever had about my mother.
Okay, I'm here.
What's the emergency?
I want you to meet Mr. Ryan.
Someone broke into his place the other night, and they were dumb enough to leave this behind.
What the hell were you thinking?
I...
I w...
um, I wasn't.
I saw two kids running away from my property.
- Who was with you?
- No one.
You steal from me, then call me a liar?
No, sir, but like I said, it was just me.
I'msorry.
I don't know what to say.
We lost our dad last year, but I swear, this isn't the way he raised us.
We can meet you down at the police station.
I'll tell you what... if the kid gives back what he took,
I won't press charges.
I was young and stupid once, too.
Careful, though.
Your next mark might not be so nice.
You come by my place tomorrow?
You know where it is.
He'll be there.
Thank you.
Listen, if there's ever anything I can do for you, you just...
just let me know.
You know what, barkeep?
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Nice going.
Hey.
- You look gorgeous.
- Amanda.
- How did you get up here?
- A sister has her ways.
My mother will freak if she knows you're up here.
Not a big fan of surprises.
I'm not afraid of her.
You shouldn't be either.
- I'm not.
- Good, 'cause if we're gonna get closer,
I...
I can't protect her anymore.
What is this?
A journal our father kept in prison.
I marked the entries that I thought you should read first.
But I have to warn you, what it says about your mother isn't pretty.
I can't imagine the fear you must have felt...
- eight weeks of torture?
- Mm-hmm.
Tell me, did you ever have a moment where you felt like giving up?
No.
The thought of never seeing my children again was far worse than anything my captor could have ever done to me.
You can call it a mother's will to survive.
More like a monster's.
I just found out the real reason you don't want me having a relationship with Amanda.
Because she knows the truth about what you did to my father.
Charlotte, this is not the time.
Who, for the record, was David Clarke.
You run that, and I will sue you for libel.
It's only libel if it isn't true.
Go ahead, Mom.
Deny it.
{Voice breaks} That's what I thought.
This interview's over.
Mom wasn't kidnapped.
She was planning to disappear.
Where did you get this?
Someone dropped it at the guard house along with that note.
She was working with him, Dad.
No, open threats are not this man's style.
If he truly wanted her dead, then she would be.
No, you're missing the larger revelation here.
Mom faked her own kidnapping.
My boy, at this moment, there are things at play that dwarf your penchant for gullibility.
Wait.
You knew about this?
Charlotte, wait.
Hey, both of you, get in here now.
Now!
You selfish, manipulative liar.
Where did this come from?
Where do you think?
Daniel, this secret was killing me.
I begged her to tell you.
You knew, too?
Don't blame her.
I can explain.
Oh, with what, more lies?
You should be begging for my forgiveness after pulling a scam like this.
You should be begging for my forgiveness, dear son.
I handed you proof of Conrad's guilt, and you chose his lies over the truth.
And the blood of every person on that government plane is on your hands as well as his.
Charlotte, whatever your mother's been telling you, pay no attention.
She's clearly not in her right mind.
And we are canceling this sham of an event.
Do that, and I will have your head on a pike.
You know, as fine as I am with a hired killer targeting you, he won't stop there, Victoria.
We're leaving the country tonight, all of us.
No, I'm through with hiding.
I'm going to put a stop to this right now, come what may.
I am so sorry for all the hell my mother put you through while we were together.
No one in their right mind would choose to live inside this family.
I despise her.
Word of advice.
Keep it to yourself.
The only way to beat your mother is to play her game better than she does.
Ladiesandgentlemen, please take your seats.
We're about to begin, and please...
Amanda, wait.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were banned from the premises.
I was.
I am.
But I'm staying for this, and so are you.
No.
I already did what you asked.
Jack would kill me if he knew I was here.
And Jack would kill you if he knew that baby you're carrying isn't his.
This is that important to me.
The choice is yours.
{Victoria, amplified voice} Ladies and gentlemen, it's always been my motto that from bad comes good.
{Camera shutters clicking}
So tonight there will be no rehashing of the past... only my aspirations for the future.
Violence to one is violence to all.
And so I would like to acknowledge those close to me who have been touched by this tragedy.
She's gone off book.
She's going to tank.
- First...
- I doubt that very much.
My daughter Charlotte.
During my confinement, I promised God that if given another chance, I would live in truth.
And this starts with the biggest admission of my life.
{Camera shutters clicking}
Charlotte...
Is the blessed consequence of my affair with David Clarke.
{Reporters gasping and murmuring}
Sweetheart, would you step up here, please?
{Murmuring continues}
{Camera shutters clicking}
{Cell phone rings}
{Ring, beep}
Yes.
Conrad, you're a smart man, so I know you've been expecting this call.
Your wife's very public accusations about our agent's alleged transgression has us all deeply concerned.
A course of action has been decided, and it involves your participation.
Next, to the saint among men...
We'll be in touch.
Who forgave my infidelity and cherished Charlotte as his own...
Conrad, come.
{Camera shutters clicking, reporters continue murmuring}
And finally, my son Daniel, whose loyalty knows no bounds.
{Camera shutters clicking, reporters continue murmuring}
There is one person missing... someone who has seen more bad than good from us, and who has never been scared off.
Her tenacity I admire, and I wish to welcome her into the fold...
Along with her child...
Amanda Clarke,
Charlotte's half sister.
{Reporters murmuring}
Amanda, please join us.
{Reporters continue murmuring}
Please.
{Camera shutters clicking}
To my abductor and to anyone who thinks they can harm this family again, make no mistake, you will fail.
Mrs.Grayson!
{Reporters shouting questions at once}
- {Lowered voice} Understood?
- Excuse me.
{Victoria, amplified voice} This concludes the press conference.
As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no questions tonight.
Victoria!
Victoria!
My God, they're stronger than ever.
{Reporters shout indistinctly}
Mom.
Thank you for your show of solidarity tonight.
Your performance was flawless.
I wasn't performing.
The truth is, I'd hate myself if I'd gotten you back only to lose you again.
I'm willing to put this all behind us if you are.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
{Woman laughs}
Oh, what a lovely tableau... mother and son reunited.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna check on Ashley.
Ms. Fisk, my apologies if today's event ruined our interview.
Actually, Conrad just made up for it by offering me an exclusive on your upcoming wedding.
I'm sorry if I spilled the proverbial beans, my pet.
I mean, I just...
I think I just got caught up in the whole... affair.
And Tuscany?
An exquisite place to honeymoon.
I'd expect nothing less.
- Thank you both.
Good night.
- Good night.
{Footsteps retreat, door opens}
You should consider it a small price to pay for publicly branding me a cuckold.
{Door closes}
I so look forward to you resuming your wifely duties, dear.
Oh, well, if that threat has any merit,
- you and I will be dead before then.
- Oh, I wouldn't bet on that.
See, I've got some breaking news of my own.
While you were dazzling the press corps,
I got a phone call from your would-be assassin's employers.
It turns out that his recent, uh, rogue and high-profile escapades have made him a target now.
So he's as good as dead, so long as we cooperate.
Oh, you fool.
You've just put us back in bed with the very architects of this entire nightmare.
Oh, Victoria.
This family has you to thank for that.
Jack?
What are you doing in here?
You and your new family were all over the news.
Did you think I wouldn't see it?
I can explain.
It's better if I do that.
My brother is the most important person in my life to me, so I get that you'd like to build a relationship with your sister.
That's exactly it, Jack.
Charlotte begged me to be there.
And if Declan needed me,
I would drop everything to be there for him, too.
It was wrong of me to try to control your relationship with the Graysons, but...
This is the last time I take ownership for your lies.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm committed to our child.
I just don't think I can commit to you.
You were right.
It's no good.
Any contacts that could've led me to the initiative were destroyed with that bullet, so I... had to go to plan "b."
You sent the passport to the Graysons to make them think the white-haired man was coming for them.
And it worked.
Conrad and the initiative are already in contact.
I had my own plan.
You could've destroyed everything.
But I didn't, did I?
Amanda Clarke is embedded in that family, and Daniel Grayson is out to ruin his mother.
Better still, he trusts you again.
You were at the house.
Oh, it was fantastic watching you capitalize on the serendipity of my actions.
Stop acting like you have my best interests at heart.
Our interests used to be one and the same.
{Wind whistling}
- Aiden?
- He's gone.
Your lover has left you behind.
I don't believe you.
This is another one of your tests.
No.
No test.
Whether you believe it or not, he chose to leave you just the same.
How does it feel to have opened yourself to betrayal, same as your father?
If you want to succeed in your goal, you must learn to close your heart.
The young man you trusted understood.
Yet, still...
You do not.
I want you to leave.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry before you'll trust me again?
{Electronic female voice} You have one unheard message.
To listen to your messages, press 1.
Gordon,it'sme .
Where are you?
Um, some guy claiming to be a Detective Lasky came by with a...
a sketch, asking questions.
I...
I know what I'm supposed to do, and if I don't hear from you by tomorrow,
I'll...
I'll start shutting everything down and go dark like we promised.
Only I'm hoping I won't have to, that somehow you're still okay.
God, Gordon, please be okay.
I love you.
Sorry this is taking so long.
He kicked for everybody else.
It's hard for the little guy to perform under pressure.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night.
(laughter)
Whoa!
It was small, but I think I felt something.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Stop laughing at it, Lily.
ALL:
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
Can we please talk about something other than my wedding night?
Absolutely.
Let's talk about last night.
It was a night like any other.
I was just about to get laid...
Hey, Barney, I need your help.
This hottie I'm talking to is meeting her friend at a club, so I need a wingman.
Well, just so you know, I'd be giving up a sure thing here.
Hey!
Are you not a sure thing?
Yeah, I am.
This "friend" of yours better be even hotter and dumber than this one.
Wow!
You have Enormous Penis Syndrome?
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.
That's the problem with E.P.S.:
lack of awareness.
That's why I'm organizing a 10K fun-run.
Of course, many of us will need wheelbarrows.
You are so brave.
And you are so understanding.
Most people just stare at me like I'm some kind of freak in reinforced underwear.
Poor, baby.
I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
(coughs) Jackpot!
You want to get out of here?
Oh, I don't know.
This is all moving kind of fast.
Okay.
Oh, but before we go,
I should mention my condition.
It's called:
I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General, I've got to say,
I don't think that's the real thing.
Okay, just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups for our friends.
Hey, how did you two meet, anyway?
No, we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants.
What?
Guys don't do that!
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!
What else are you allergic to, huh?
You owe me three hours for last night, Mosby.
I'm thinking, laser tag tournament in Newark this weekend.
Ted can pass for under 18, right?
It's a father-son thing.
Marshall, we should get going.
Any later, and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.
The Drunk Train?
It's the last train of the night back to Long Island.
It's a mess.
LILY:
Just a bunch of drunk, sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves.
Yeah.
Bye.
MARSHALL:
See you.
New plan, Ted.
So this father-son thing.
You know, a backwards baseball cap really youngs me down.
All aboard!
(train chugging, train whistle toots)
♪ How I Met Your Mother 7x16 ♪ The Drunk Train Original Air Date on February 13, 2012
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
NARRATOR:
For Valentine's weekend, Lily and Marshall invited
Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont.
BOTH:
Mmm.
16 years together, and still so in love.
MARSHALL:
Mm.
What's your secret?
The key to relationships is understanding the difference between hearing and listening.
It's about respecting your partner's...
Opinions on...
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Kind of on a roll here.
Relationships are a give and take, and that's why it's important to never keep score.
LILY:
Yeah, like how
Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head.
If they were a couple, they'd never work.
Obviously.
Ted's a Taurus, and Barney is such a Scorpio.
Good advice.
Don't keep score.
They're not even close to finished.
How do we not keep score, you ask?
Huh.
Hm.
Sounds like somebody want to hear some examples, sweetie.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna close my eyes until it's all over.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Solid.
Here's one.
Every time Marshall's mom comes to visit us, we have to put out all the tacky Minnesota gifts she's bought us over the years.
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!
Marshall.
Uh-huh.
I don't see the gopher-hair tea cozy I made you.
(sighs) Guess it wasn't good enough for Lily.
But I'd never hold that over Marshall, because if I did, he'd owe me big-time.
Just like I would never hold it over you for dragging me to that experimental theater piece.
(woman screaming onstage)
(sustained, intense screaming)
Is it... is it just screaming?
But we don't keep score.
Gotcha, loud and clear.
Don't keep score.
Because if we did, then Marshall would owe me for killing my cousin's dog.
How did I know that he would eat my wallet?
Why was your wallet filled with chocolate?
!
So we're back to this argument!
NARRATOR:
That night, Barney and I found ourselves in a strange, new universe called...
The Drunk Train.
Hey!
Where has this heavenly vehicle been all my life?
Can you hear its inspiring chant, Ted?
I think I can get laid, I think I can get laid.
It's-it's The Little Engine with Wood,
The Whore-ient Express.
The Long Island Tail Road!
Oh, I got one.
Thomas the Spank Engine!
Ted, that is a children's book.
(bottle shattering)
Okay, as fun as this place is, it's late.
So, what's our play?
And don't say, "The Siamese Twins""
We're not stretching out another one of my jackets.
No, dude, this is the Drunk Train.
We don't need a play!
All we have to do is sit back, play it cool, scope out the hotties, and by the end of the line, we will totally be sleeping with someone.
(both snoring)
(bottle smashing)
You know, you are so great.
You sat there listening to Marshall and Lily bicker all night, and you didn't complain once.
Well, I am a therapist, so I do plan on billing them.
I also have a couple powerful medications that might help.
Lily can't take anything;
she's pregnant.
I meant for us.
If we're getting through five more meals and a sleigh ride with those guys, we need to be spaced out of our gourds.
Well, if we are keeping score,
I owe you one weekend, mister.
I was thinking a little longer than that.
What do you mean?
Robin, will you marry me?
Look, I know this is fast.
I'm just excited to start a life with you.
If that's what you want.
Wow.
Um...
I'm-I'm not saying no.
I'm-I'm not saying anything.
I just, um...
I-I need some time to think.
I totally understand.
Um, take as much time as you need.
I'll just, uh...
I'll just keep this here until you're ready.
(laughs)
(sighs)
Any chance we could put that bad boy away for now?
It's really just staring at us, isn't it?
(panting):
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
I thought of some new great names for the Drunk Train.
Slamtrak!
Uh-huh.
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!
Thomas the Spank Engine!
I said that one yesterday.
(in high-pitched voice):
I don't think you did.
Wow.
Someone's had some coffee.
Yeah. 18 cups!
There is no way I'm falling asleep tonight!
That Quinn girl is so wrong.
She said I could never love anything, but I love this train!
She said you could never love anything?
That's intense.
Oh, you have no idea.
Stop staring.
Not gonna happen.
Is there any way we can start over and get to know each other?
I already know you.
Oh, really?
- You wear a suit all the time.
- Obviously.
You have a stupid rule about everything.
I pay for the meal, you handle my deal.
That's just good manners.
But you end most nights alone at a strip club, feeling empty inside, telling yourself your life is somehow epic or classic or...
legendary.
I never say epic or classic.
(laughs) Do you practice the dark arts?
No, they did not forget the potato salad in your takeout order!
(mimes mind exploding)
Wh-What happened next?
!
For the last time, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Your debt is paid.
You don't have to come on the Drunk Train anymore.
You're never gonna meet the one there, anyway.
- Oh, screw the one!
- What?
Every date I've been on lately has been brutal.
Last week, I went out with a girl whose favorite band was Glee.
Plus, it's almost Valentine's Day, and I'm alone without anything close to a girlfriend.
So... all aboard!
I have never been more proud of you.
Come on.
Ted, tonight is gonna be epic-- wait for it-- dary!
Wait.
No, that's not it.
How do I usually say it?
I hate this Quinn girl!
Well,
I propose we order a bottle of wine.
- (whispers loudly):
Propose!
- Not propose.
Suggest.
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily, take it.
Why don't we get an appetizer?
How about the...
onion rings?
I mean, diamond rings.
I mean, diamond circles.
I mean, onion circles.
I know they're fattening, but I hear this place has great onion circles.
So, Robin, about not telling them?
The green salad looks interesting.
You're so much better without him.
If you ask me, Vinnie's a real jerk.
Hey, don't you dare badmouth Vinnie!
Ow!
So what do you do?
Well, I teach architecture, and I also...
Oh, big man with a job.
You think yore better than me?
What... (chuckles)
So... where do you live?
I'm on the Upper West Side.
Oh, big man.
Living in Manhattan.
What, you think you're better than me?
Ehhh!
Ehhhh!
You think you're better than me?
!
Well, it's a close one.
Lily made 14 awkward references to marriage, and Marshall made an even 60.
I'm so sorry, Kevin.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go to bed, but you guys think tomorrow we can stop with all the marriage talk?
I do.
I do.
That's a half a point each.
See you in a minute.
Okay.
(sighs) So?
Are you any closer to deciding?
Ooh...
Uh... well, there is something you don't know.
Um...
Can you guys keep a secret?
Yeah.
Well, some of us can.
Well, there's something
I have been keeping from everyone for the last couple of months.
Um...
I found out that I can't have children.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
I can't believe that we didn't know.
No, you know, I've had some... time to deal with this by myself, and...
I'm okay.
For real.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
So... even though I love Kevin and I... think I want to say yes,
I can't until I tell him.
But I'm scared it'll end our relationship.
MARSHALL:
You know what, Robin?
If it's meant to be, then it won't matter.
Yeah, you just have to tell him.
(groans) Thank God we had the keys to Marshall and Lily's place.
Pretty sure I told you that before you kicked in that side window.
You mean, before the "burglars" kicked in that side window and stole all of Lily's underwear.
(groans)
What the hell happened on that train?
It was absolute chaos.
Ted, when I was at M.I.T., my favorite Einstein quote was:
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."
You didn't go to M.I.T.
I didn't?
Huh.
I actually have no idea where you went to college.
Who are you?
(chuckles) If we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train, taking into account standard deviation, and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi, we can conclude... (snoring)
Damn it, Ted!
I was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log.
(snoring) I'll remember it.
NARRATOR:
The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret.
I know that this is a lot to process, so... you take all the time you need.
And I understand...
Robin... will you marry me?
Yes.
What are you doing?
The top speed of the Drunk Train is 73 miles per hour, and you factor in an aggregate of 32 boobs per car,
28 of which are motorboatable, and you divide that...
No, no, no!
This is all wrong!
It should be so simple!
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!
My God...
it's been right in front of us the whole time.
"Get drunk""
Yeah.
Of course.
Good circling, Ted.
This ain't my first word search.
So my Mom's already picked a date, venue and caterer for the wedding.
But nothing's set in stone.
My great-aunt's gonna sing.
That's happening.
Are you really okay with this?
Yeah, she's actually got a decent voice.
No, are you... are you okay with everything that we talked about?
Of course, Robin, I love you.
Besides, there are other ways to have kids.
There's adoption, surrogacy...
No, Kevin, it's not just that I can't have kids,
I don't want kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Knowing that, do you want to take your proposal back?
Will you marry me?
Oh, you take such good care of me.
Thanks for loaning me your shoes for my swollen feet.
Ah!
I owe you one.
We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Keeping score.
You're growing a baby, our baby.
So you're officially ahead of me for life.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Once we're parents, we have to be a team.
Deal?
(baby crying) It's your turn!
I was on point for six straight hours yesterday!
Two of those hours were a nap and you know it!
Let's go to the board!
I hope it's a soupy deuce, sucka.
(chortles)
Deal.
We're a team.
I was all, "Do I look like I'm from Ronkonkoma?
!"
ALL:
Oh...!
That's all you gotta say!
Oh, oh, oh, big man with a briefcase!
What do you think, you're better than me?
!
(all laughing)
Hey, our stop's next.
Do you want to join us?
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.
Too skanky.
Too skanky?
Eh...
It's the Drunk Train.
You crossed out all the stops and wrote "Vaginaville."
That's not true.
That one says "Boner Gardens." (snickers)
What's going on?
Wait.
Did that Quinn girl shake your game or something?
Hell no!
At the end of the night...
You know, I went out tonight looking for a cheap, meaningless fling.
But you turned out to be so special.
I'd hate to ruin this friendship with sex.
Oh, oh, I am willing to take that risk.
Good one, Ted.
Anyway, I'm seriously contemplating purchasing a new ironing board.
Do you think...?
Okay, I'll give you this:
You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me.
That was pretty cool.
Yeah, you know, in retrospect, I think that was the moment you decided to come back to my place and get nasty.
(laughs) Yeah, right.
Get up.
You're on my bra.
Sorry.
(grunts)
Where's your bathroom?
Past the kitchen, down the hall.
See, I feel like I would remember you two being naked on your couch in the middle of the club.
Oh, right.
That was later in my apartment after we got nasty.
My bad.
So, you want to go to a diner or something?
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?
I know, I know.
I'm late on sending the pictures.
I've been swamped.
You like Quinn.
I...
That's why you can't stop "complaining" about her.
That's why you just tanked our chance with these... lovely innocent flowers.
I don't even care where we go, but I hate doing it on the ground.
Barney, do you know why
I'm on the Drunk Train on Valentine's Day?
Because I have nothing better to do.
No one I can't stop thinking about.
So if you feel something for Quinn, go for it.
Because you're wasting your time here.
We both are.
I don't like Quinn!
Kevin, I love you, but please don't just be the nice guy who says the right thing.
Robin, I want to marry you no matter what.
Assuming you don't turn into a big fat fattie.
See?
Right there.
Don't always say the right thing.
Look, you just got a truckload of new information dumped on you.
Will you marry me?
My feelings on kids aren't gonna change.
Will you marry me?
Haven't you always wanted kids?
That was before I fell in love with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always had kids in it.
That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year or ten or 50, full of regret.
So...
I need you to be sure, okay?
If we get married, you will never have children.
Are you really okay with that?
Enormous Penis Syndrome?
E.P.S.
It's all about awareness.
That's why we're doing the fun run, the silent auction, the three-legged race.
Of course, that's just one guy.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You can let me out up here.
Why?
You got a girlfriend or something?
Maybe something.
NARRATOR:
Kids, sometimes you realize the journey you've been taking has reached its final stop.
So, the question becomes:
Where do you go next?
Hey.
Are you okay?
♪ A year from now, we'll all be gone ♪
♪ All our friends will move away ♪
♪ And they're going to better places ♪
♪ But our friends will be gone away... ♪
So... he un-proposed.
♪ Nothing is as it has been...
We're over.
And I-I...
I-I know it's for the best.
It's just...
I was finally ready for something serious.
He seemed like the guy to take that next step with.
But he couldn't look past this.
I mean, who could?
(sighs)
I could.
I love you, Robin.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
You've been complaining about this Barney guy so much,
I'm starting to think that you like him.
Like his apartment-- check.
Like his moves downtown-- check plus.
But like him?
Ugh.
Please.
I'm just surprised he doesn't recognize you.
He practically lives here.
ANNOUNCER:
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
(men whooping)
Sorry this is taking so long.
He kicked for everybody else.
It's hard for the little guy to perform under pressure.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night.
(laughter)
Whoa!
It was small, but I think I felt something.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Stop laughing at it, Lily.
ALL:
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
Can we please talk about something other than my wedding night?
Absolutely.
Let's talk about last night.
It was a night like any other.
I was just about to get laid...
Hey, Barney, I need your help.
This hottie I'm talking to is meeting her friend at a club, so I need a wingman.
Well, just so you know, I'd be giving up a sure thing here.
Hey!
Are you not a sure thing?
Yeah, I am.
This "friend" of yours better be even hotter and dumber than this one.
Wow!
You have Enormous Penis Syndrome?
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.
That's the problem with E.P.S.:
lack of awareness.
That's why I'm organizing a 10K fun-run.
Of course, many of us will need wheelbarrows.
You are so brave.
And you are so understanding.
Most people just stare at me like I'm some kind of freak in reinforced underwear.
Poor, baby.
I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
(coughs) Jackpot!
You want to get out of here?
Oh, I don't know.
This is all moving kind of fast.
Okay.
Oh, but before we go,
I should mention my condition.
It's called:
I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General, I've got to say,
I don't think that's the real thing.
Okay, just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups for our friends.
Hey, how did you two meet, anyway?
No, we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants.
What?
Guys don't do that!
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!
What else are you allergic to, huh?
You owe me three hours for last night, Mosby.
I'm thinking, laser tag tournament in Newark this weekend.
Ted can pass for under 18, right?
It's a father-son thing.
Marshall, we should get going.
Any later, and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.
The Drunk Train?
It's the last train of the night back to Long Island.
It's a mess.
LILY:
Just a bunch of drunk, sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves.
Yeah.
Bye.
MARSHALL:
See you.
New plan, Ted.
So this father-son thing.
You know, a backwards baseball cap really youngs me down.
All aboard!
(train chugging, train whistle toots)
NARRATOR:
For Valentine's weekend, Lily and Marshall invited
Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont.
BOTH:
Mmm.
16 years together, and still so in love.
MARSHALL:
Mm.
What's your secret?
The key to relationships is understanding the difference between hearing and listening.
It's about respecting your partner's...
Opinions on...
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Kind of on a roll here.
Relationships are a give and take, and that's why it's important to never keep score.
LILY:
Yeah, like how
Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head.
If they were a couple, they'd never work.
Obviously.
Ted's a Taurus, and Barney is such a Scorpio.
Good advice.
Don't keep score.
They're not even close to finished.
How do we not keep score, you ask?
Huh.
Hm.
Sounds like somebody want to hear some examples, sweetie.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna close my eyes until it's all over.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Solid.
Here's one.
Every time Marshall's mom comes to visit us, we have to put out all the tacky Minnesota gifts she's bought us over the years.
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!
Marshall.
Uh-huh.
I don't see the gopher-hair tea cozy I made you.
(sighs) Guess it wasn't good enough for Lily.
But I'd never hold that over Marshall, because if I did, he'd owe me big-time.
Just like I would never hold it over you for dragging me to that experimental theater piece.
(woman screaming onstage)
(sustained, intense screaming)
Is it... is it just screaming?
But we don't keep score.
Gotcha, loud and clear.
Don't keep score.
Because if we did, then Marshall would owe me for killing my cousin's dog.
How did I know that he would eat my wallet?
Why was your wallet filled with chocolate?
!
So we're back to this argument!
NARRATOR:
That night, Barney and I found ourselves in a strange, new universe called...
The Drunk Train.
Hey!
Where has this heavenly vehicle been all my life?
Can you hear its inspiring chant, Ted?
I think I can get laid, I think I can get laid.
It's-it's The Little Engine with Wood,
The Whore-ient Express.
The Long Island Tail Road!
Oh, I got one.
Thomas the Spank Engine!
Ted, that is a children's book.
(bottle shattering)
Okay, as fun as this place is, it's late.
So, what's our play?
And don't say, "The Siamese Twins""
We're not stretching out another one of my jackets.
No, dude, this is the Drunk Train.
We don't need a play!
All we have to do is sit back, play it cool, scope out the hotties, and by the end of the line, we will totally be sleeping with someone.
(both snoring)
(bottle smashing)
You know, you are so great.
You sat there listening to Marshall and Lily bicker all night, and you didn't complain once.
Well, I am a therapist, so I do plan on billing them.
I also have a couple powerful medications that might help.
Lily can't take anything;
she's pregnant.
I meant for us.
If we're getting through five more meals and a sleigh ride with those guys, we need to be spaced out of our gourds.
Well, if we are keeping score,
I owe you one weekend, mister.
I was thinking a little longer than that.
What do you mean?
Robin, will you marry me?
Look, I know this is fast.
I'm just excited to start a life with you.
If that's what you want.
Wow.
Um...
I'm-I'm not saying no.
I'm-I'm not saying anything.
I just, um...
I-I need some time to think.
I totally understand.
Um, take as much time as you need.
I'll just, uh...
I'll just keep this here until you're ready.
(laughs)
(sighs)
Any chance we could put that bad boy away for now?
It's really just staring at us, isn't it?
(panting):
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
I thought of some new great names for the Drunk Train.
Slamtrak!
Uh-huh.

That was before I fell in love with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always had kids in it.
That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year or ten or 50, full of regret.
So...
I need you to be sure, okay?
If we get married, you will never have children.
Are you really okay with that?
Enormous Penis Syndrome?
E.P.S.
It's all about awareness.
That's why we're doing the fun run, the silent auction, the three-legged race.
Of course, that's just one guy.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You can let me out up here.
Why?
You got a girlfriend or something?
Maybe something.
NARRATOR:
Kids, sometimes you realize the journey you've been taking has reached its final stop.
So, the question becomes:
Where do you go next?
Hey.
Are you okay?
♪ A year from now, we'll all be gone ♪
♪ All our friends will move away ♪
♪ And they're going to better places ♪
♪ But our friends will be gone away... ♪
So... he un-proposed.
♪ Nothing is as it has been...
We're over.
And I-I...
I-I know it's for the best.
It's just...
I was finally ready for something serious.
He seemed like the guy to take that next step with.
But he couldn't look past this.
I mean, who could?
(sighs)
I could.
I love you, Robin.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
You've been complaining about this Barney guy so much,
I'm starting to think that you like him.
Like his apartment-- check.
Like his moves downtown-- check plus.
But like him?
Ugh.
Please.
I'm just surprised he doesn't recognize you.
He practically lives here.
ANNOUNCER:
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
(men whooping)
Sorry this is taking so long.
He kicked for everybody else.
It's hard for the little guy to perform under pressure.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night.
Whoa!
It was small, but I think I felt something.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Stop laughing at it, Lily.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
Can we please talk about something other than my wedding night?
Absolutely.
Let's talk about last night.
It was a night like any other.
I was just about to get laid...
Hey, Barney, I need your help.
This hottie I'm talking to is meeting her friend at a club, so I need a wingman.
Well, just so you know, I'd be giving up a sure thing here.
Hey!
Are you not a sure thing?
Yeah, I am.
This "friend" of yours better be even hotter and dumber than this one.
Wow!
You have Enormous Penis Syndrome?
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.
That's the problem with E.P.S.:
lack of awareness.
That's why I'm organizing a 10K fun-run.
Of course, many of us will need wheelbarrows.
You are so brave.
And you are so understanding.
Most people just stare at me like I'm some kind of freak in reinforced underwear.
Poor, baby.
I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
Jackpot!
You want to get out of here?
Oh, I don't know.
This is all moving kind of fast.
Okay.
Oh, but before we go,
I should mention my condition.
It's called:
I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General, I've got to say,
I don't think that's the real thing.
Okay, just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups for our friends.
Hey, how did you two meet, anyway?
No, we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants.
What?
Guys don't do that!
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!
What else are you allergic to, huh?
You owe me three hours for last night, Mosby.
I'm thinking, laser tag tournament in Newark this weekend.
Ted can pass for under 18, right?
It's a father-son thing.
Marshall, we should get going.
Any later, and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.
The Drunk Train?
It's the last train of the night back to Long Island.
It's a mess.
Just a bunch of drunk, sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves.
Yeah.
Bye.
See you.
New plan, Ted.
So this father-son thing.
You know, a backwards baseball cap really youngs me down.
All aboard!
♪ How I Met Your Mother 7x16 ♪ The Drunk Train Original Air Date on February 13, 2012
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
- For Valentine's weekend,
- Lily and Marshall invited
Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont.
Mmm.
16 years together, and still so in love.
- Mm.
- What's your secret?
The key to relationships is understanding the difference between hearing and listening.
It's about respecting your partner's...
Opinions on...
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Kind of on a roll here.
Relationships are a give and take, and that's why it's important to never keep score.
Yeah, like how
Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head.
If they were a couple, they'd never work.
Obviously.
Ted's a Taurus, and Barney is such a Scorpio.
Good advice.
Don't keep score.
They're not even close to finished.
How do we not keep score, you ask?
Huh.
Hm.
Sounds like somebody want to hear some examples, sweetie.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna close my eyes until it's all over.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Solid.
Here's one.
Every time Marshall's mom comes to visit us, we have to put out all the tacky Minnesota gifts she's bought us over the years.
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!
Marshall.
Uh-huh.
I don't see the gopher-hair tea cozy I made you.
Guess it wasn't good enough for Lily.
But I'd never hold that over Marshall, because if I did, he'd owe me big-time.
Just like I would never hold it over you for dragging me to that experimental theater piece.
Is it... is it just screaming?
But we don't keep score.
Gotcha, loud and clear.
Don't keep score.
Because if we did, then Marshall would owe me for killing my cousin's dog.
How did I know that he would eat my wallet?
Why was your wallet filled with chocolate?
!
So we're back to this argument!
That night, Barney and I found ourselves in a strange, new universe called...
The Drunk Train.
Hey!
Where has this heavenly vehicle been all my life?
Can you hear its inspiring chant, Ted?
I think I can get laid, I think I can get laid.
It's-it's The Little Engine with Wood,
The Whore-ient Express.
The Long Island Tail Road!
Oh, I got one.
Thomas the Spank Engine!
Ted, that is a children's book.
Okay, as fun as this place is, it's late.
So, what's our play?
And don't say, "The Siamese Twins""
We're not stretching out another one of my jackets.
No, dude, this is the Drunk Train.
We don't need a play!
All we have to do is sit back, play it cool, scope out the hotties, and by the end of the line, we will totally be sleeping with someone.
You know, you are so great.
You sat there listening to Marshall and Lily bicker all night, and you didn't complain once.
Well, I am a therapist, so I do plan on billing them.
I also have a couple powerful medications that might help.
Lily can't take anything;
she's pregnant.
I meant for us.
If we're getting through five more meals and a sleigh ride with those guys, we need to be spaced out of our gourds.
Well, if we are keeping score,
I owe you one weekend, mister.
I was thinking a little longer than that.
What do you mean?
Robin, will you marry me?
Look, I know this is fast.
I'm just excited to start a life with you.
If that's what you want.
Wow.
Um...
I'm-I'm not saying no.
I'm-I'm not saying anything.
I just, um...
I-I need some time to think.
I totally understand.
Um, take as much time as you need.
I'll just, uh...
I'll just keep this here until you're ready.
Any chance we could put that bad boy away for now?
It's really just staring at us, isn't it?
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
I thought of some new great names for the Drunk Train.
Slamtrak!
Uh-huh.
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!
Thomas the Spank Engine!
I said that one yesterday.
I don't think you did.
Wow.
Someone's had some coffee.
Yeah. 18 cups!
There is no way I'm falling asleep tonight!
That Quinn girl is so wrong.
She said I could never love anything, but I love this train!
She said you could never love anything?
That's intense.
Oh, you have no idea.
Stop staring.
Not gonna happen.
Is there any way we can start over and get to know each other?
I already know you.
Oh, really?
- You wear a suit all the time.
- Obviously.
You have a stupid rule about everything.
I pay for the meal, you handle my deal.
That's just good manners.
But you end most nights alone at a strip club, feeling empty inside, telling yourself your life is somehow epic or classic or...
legendary.
I never say epic or classic.
Do you practice the dark arts?
No, they did not forget the potato salad in your takeout order!
Wh-What happened next?
!
For the last time, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Your debt is paid.
You don't have to come on the Drunk Train anymore.
You're never gonna meet the one there, anyway.
- Oh, screw the one!
- What?
Every date I've been on lately has been brutal.
Last week, I went out with a girl whose favorite band was Glee.
Plus, it's almost Valentine's Day, and I'm alone without anything close to a girlfriend.
So... all aboard!
I have never been more proud of you.
Come on.
Ted, tonight is gonna be epic-- wait for it-- dary!
Wait.
No, that's not it.
How do I usually say it?
I hate this Quinn girl!
Well,
I propose we order a bottle of wine.
- Propose!
- Not propose.
Suggest.
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily, take it.
Why don't we get an appetizer?
How about the...
onion rings?
I mean, diamond rings.
I mean, diamond circles.
I mean, onion circles.
I know they're fattening, but I hear this place has great onion circles.
So, Robin, about not telling them?
The green salad looks interesting.
You're so much better without him.
If you ask me, Vinnie's a real jerk.
Hey, don't you dare badmouth Vinnie!
Ow!
So what do you do?
Well, I teach architecture, and I also...
Oh, big man with a job.
You think yore better than me?
What...
So... where do you live?
I'm on the Upper West Side.
Oh, big man.
Living in Manhattan.
What, you think you're better than me?
Ehhh!
Ehhhh!
You think you're better than me?
!
Well, it's a close one.
Lily made 14 awkward references to marriage, and Marshall made an even 60.
I'm so sorry, Kevin.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go to bed, but you guys think tomorrow we can stop with all the marriage talk?
I do.
I do.
That's a half a point each.
See you in a minute.
Okay.
So?
Are you any closer to deciding?
Ooh...
Uh... well, there is something you don't know.
Um...
Can you guys keep a secret?
Yeah.
Well, some of us can.
Well, there's something
I have been keeping from everyone for the last couple of months.
Um...
I found out that I can't have children.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
I can't believe that we didn't know.
No, you know, I've had some... time to deal with this by myself, and...
I'm okay.
For real.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
So... even though I love Kevin and I... think I want to say yes,
I can't until I tell him.
But I'm scared it'll end our relationship.
You know what, Robin?
If it's meant to be, then it won't matter.
Yeah, you just have to tell him.
Thank God we had the keys to Marshall and Lily's place.
Pretty sure I told you that before you kicked in that side window.
You mean, before the "burglars" kicked in that side window and stole all of Lily's underwear.
What the hell happened on that train?
It was absolute chaos.
Ted, when I was at M.I.T., my favorite Einstein quote was:
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."
You didn't go to M.I.T.
I didn't?
Huh.
I actually have no idea where you went to college.
Who are you?
If we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train, taking into account standard deviation, and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi, we can conclude...
Damn it, Ted!
I was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log.
I'll remember it.
The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret.
I know that this is a lot to process, so... you take all the time you need.
And I understand...
Robin... will you marry me?
Yes.
What are you doing?
The top speed of the Drunk Train is 73 miles per hour, and you factor in an aggregate of 32 boobs per car,
28 of which are motorboatable, and you divide that...
No, no, no!
This is all wrong!
It should be so simple!
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!
My God...
it's been right in front of us the whole time.
"Get drunk""
Yeah.
Of course.
Good circling, Ted.
This ain't my first word search.
So my Mom's already picked a date, venue and caterer for the wedding.
But nothing's set in stone.
My great-aunt's gonna sing.
That's happening.
Are you really okay with this?
Yeah, she's actually got a decent voice.
No, are you... are you okay with everything that we talked about?
Of course, Robin, I love you.
Besides, there are other ways to have kids.
There's adoption, surrogacy...
No, Kevin, it's not just that I can't have kids,
I don't want kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Knowing that, do you want to take your proposal back?
Will you marry me?
Oh, you take such good care of me.
Thanks for loaning me your shoes for my swollen feet.
Ah!
I owe you one.
We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Keeping score.
You're growing a baby, our baby.
So you're officially ahead of me for life.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Once we're parents, we have to be a team.
Deal?
It's your turn!
I was on point for six straight hours yesterday!
Two of those hours were a nap and you know it!
Let's go to the board!
I hope it's a soupy deuce, sucka.
Deal.
We're a team.
I was all, "Do I look like I'm from Ronkonkoma?
!"
Oh...!
That's all you gotta say!
Oh, oh, oh, big man with a briefcase!
What do you think, you're better than me?
!
Hey, our stop's next.
Do you want to join us?
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.
Too skanky.
Too skanky?
Eh...
It's the Drunk Train.
You crossed out all the stops and wrote "Vaginaville."
That's not true.
That one says "Boner Gardens."
What's going on?
Wait.
Did that Quinn girl shake your game or something?
Hell no!
At the end of the night...
You know, I went out tonight looking for a cheap, meaningless fling.
But you turned out to be so special.
I'd hate to ruin this friendship with sex.
Oh, oh, I am willing to take that risk.
Good one, Ted.
Anyway, I'm seriously contemplating purchasing a new ironing board.
Do you think...?
Okay, I'll give you this:
You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me.
That was pretty cool.
Yeah, you know, in retrospect, I think that was the moment you decided to come back to my place and get nasty.
Yeah, right.
Get up.
You're on my bra.
Sorry.
Where's your bathroom?
Past the kitchen, down the hall.
See, I feel like I would remember you two being naked on your couch in the middle of the club.
Oh, right.
That was later in my apartment after we got nasty.
My bad.
So, you want to go to a diner or something?
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?
I know, I know.
I'm late on sending the pictures.
I've been swamped.
You like Quinn.
I...
That's why you can't stop "complaining" about her.
That's why you just tanked our chance with these... lovely innocent flowers.
I don't even care where we go, but I hate doing it on the ground.
Barney, do you know why
I'm on the Drunk Train on Valentine's Day?
Because I have nothing better to do.
No one I can't stop thinking about.
So if you feel something for Quinn, go for it.
Because you're wasting your time here.
We both are.
I don't like Quinn!
Kevin, I love you, but please don't just be the nice guy who says the right thing.
Robin, I want to marry you no matter what.
Assuming you don't turn into a big fat fattie.
See?
Right there.
Don't always say the right thing.
Look, you just got a truckload of new information dumped on you.
Will you marry me?
My feelings on kids aren't gonna change.
Will you marry me?
Haven't you always wanted kids?
That was before I fell in love with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always had kids in it.
That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...

I propose we order a bottle of wine.
- Propose!
- Not propose.
Suggest.
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily, take it.
Why don't we get an appetizer?
How about the...
onion rings?
I mean, diamond rings.
I mean, diamond circles.
I mean, onion circles.
I know they're fattening, but I hear this place has great onion circles.
So, Robin, about not telling them?
The green salad looks interesting.
You're so much better without him.
If you ask me, Vinnie's a real jerk.
Hey, don't you dare badmouth Vinnie!
Ow!
So what do you do?
Well, I teach architecture, and I also...
Oh, big man with a job.
You think yore better than me?
What...
So... where do you live?
I'm on the Upper West Side.
Oh, big man.
Living in Manhattan.
What, you think you're better than me?
Ehhh!
Ehhhh!
You think you're better than me?
!
Well, it's a close one.
Lily made 14 awkward references to marriage, and Marshall made an even 60.
I'm so sorry, Kevin.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go to bed, but you guys think tomorrow we can stop with all the marriage talk?
I do.
I do.
That's a half a point each.
See you in a minute.
Okay.
So?
Are you any closer to deciding?
Ooh...
Uh... well, there is something you don't know.
Um...
Can you guys keep a secret?
Yeah.
Well, some of us can.
Well, there's something
I have been keeping from everyone for the last couple of months.
Um...
I found out that I can't have children.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
I can't believe that we didn't know.
No, you know, I've had some... time to deal with this by myself, and...
I'm okay.
For real.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
So... even though I love Kevin and I... think I want to say yes,
I can't until I tell him.
But I'm scared it'll end our relationship.
You know what, Robin?
If it's meant to be, then it won't matter.
Yeah, you just have to tell him.
Thank God we had the keys to Marshall and Lily's place.
Pretty sure I told you that before you kicked in that side window.
You mean, before the "burglars" kicked in that side window and stole all of Lily's underwear.
What the hell happened on that train?
It was absolute chaos.
Ted, when I was at M.I.T., my favorite Einstein quote was:
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."
You didn't go to M.I.T.
I didn't?
Huh.
I actually have no idea where you went to college.
Who are you?
If we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train, taking into account standard deviation, and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi, we can conclude...
Damn it, Ted!
I was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log.
I'll remember it.
The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret.
I know that this is a lot to process, so... you take all the time you need.
And I understand...
Robin... will you marry me?
Yes.
What are you doing?
The top speed of the Drunk Train is 73 miles per hour, and you factor in an aggregate of 32 boobs per car,
28 of which are motorboatable, and you divide that...
No, no, no!
This is all wrong!
It should be so simple!
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!
My God...
it's been right in front of us the whole time.
"Get drunk""
Yeah.
Of course.
Good circling, Ted.
This ain't my first word search.
So my Mom's already picked a date, venue and caterer for the wedding.
But nothing's set in stone.
My great-aunt's gonna sing.
That's happening.
Are you really okay with this?
Yeah, she's actually got a decent voice.
No, are you... are you okay with everything that we talked about?
Of course, Robin, I love you.
Besides, there are other ways to have kids.
There's adoption, surrogacy...
No, Kevin, it's not just that I can't have kids,
I don't want kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Knowing that, do you want to take your proposal back?
Will you marry me?
Oh, you take such good care of me.
Thanks for loaning me your shoes for my swollen feet.
Ah!
I owe you one.
We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Keeping score.
You're growing a baby, our baby.
So you're officially ahead of me for life.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Once we're parents, we have to be a team.
Deal?
It's your turn!
I was on point for six straight hours yesterday!
Two of those hours were a nap and you know it!
Let's go to the board!
I hope it's a soupy deuce, sucka.
Deal.
We're a team.
I was all, "Do I look like I'm from Ronkonkoma?
!"
Oh...!
That's all you gotta say!
Oh, oh, oh, big man with a briefcase!
What do you think, you're better than me?
!
Hey, our stop's next.
Do you want to join us?
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.
Too skanky.
Too skanky?
Eh...
It's the Drunk Train.
You crossed out all the stops and wrote "Vaginaville."
That's not true.
That one says "Boner Gardens."
What's going on?
Wait.
Did that Quinn girl shake your game or something?
Hell no!
At the end of the night...
You know, I went out tonight looking for a cheap, meaningless fling.
But you turned out to be so special.
I'd hate to ruin this friendship with sex.
Oh, oh, I am willing to take that risk.
Good one, Ted.
Anyway, I'm seriously contemplating purchasing a new ironing board.
Do you think...?
Okay, I'll give you this:
You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me.
That was pretty cool.
Yeah, you know, in retrospect, I think that was the moment you decided to come back to my place and get nasty.
Yeah, right.
Get up.
You're on my bra.
Sorry.
Where's your bathroom?
Past the kitchen, down the hall.
See, I feel like I would remember you two being naked on your couch in the middle of the club.
Oh, right.
That was later in my apartment after we got nasty.
My bad.
So, you want to go to a diner or something?
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?
I know, I know.
I'm late on sending the pictures.
I've been swamped.
You like Quinn.
I...
That's why you can't stop "complaining" about her.
That's why you just tanked our chance with these... lovely innocent flowers.
I don't even care where we go, but I hate doing it on the ground.
Barney, do you know why
I'm on the Drunk Train on Valentine's Day?
Because I have nothing better to do.
No one I can't stop thinking about.
So if you feel something for Quinn, go for it.
Because you're wasting your time here.
We both are.
I don't like Quinn!
Kevin, I love you, but please don't just be the nice guy who says the right thing.
Robin, I want to marry you no matter what.
Assuming you don't turn into a big fat fattie.
See?
Right there.
Don't always say the right thing.
Look, you just got a truckload of new information dumped on you.
Will you marry me?
My feelings on kids aren't gonna change.
Will you marry me?
Haven't you always wanted kids?
That was before I fell in love with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always had kids in it.
That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year or ten or 50, full of regret.
So...
I need you to be sure, okay?
If we get married, you will never have children.
Are you really okay with that?
Enormous Penis Syndrome?
E.P.S.
It's all about awareness.
That's why we're doing the fun run, the silent auction, the three-legged race.
Of course, that's just one guy.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You can let me out up here.
Why?
You got a girlfriend or something?
Maybe something.
Kids, sometimes you realize the journey you've been taking has reached its final stop.
Where do you go next?
Hey.
Are you okay?
♪ A year from now, we'll all be gone ♪
♪ All our friends will move away ♪
♪ And they're going to better places ♪
♪ But our friends will be gone away... ♪
So... he un-proposed.
♪ Nothing is as it has been...
We're over.
And I-I...
I-I know it's for the best.
It's just...
I was finally ready for something serious.
He seemed like the guy to take that next step with.
But he couldn't look past this.
I mean, who could?
I could.
I love you, Robin.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
You've been complaining about this Barney guy so much,
I'm starting to think that you like him.
Like his apartment-- check.
Like his moves downtown-- check plus.
But like him?
Ugh.
Please.
I'm just surprised he doesn't recognize you.
He practically lives here.
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
Sorry this is taking so long.
He kicked for everybody else.
It's hard for the little guy to perform under pressure.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night.
Whoa!
It was small,but I think I felt something.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Stop laughing at it,Lily.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
Can we please talk about something other than my wedding night?
Absolutely.
Let's talk about last night.
It was a night like any other.
I was just about to get laid...
Hey,Barney,I need your help.
This hottie I'm talking to is meeting her friend at a club, so I need a wingman.
Well,just so you know,I'd be giving up a sure thing here.
- Are you not a sure thing?
- Yeah,I am.
This "friend" of yours better be even hotter and dumber than this one.
Wow!
You have Enormous Penis Syndrome?
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.
That's the problem with E.P.S. lack of awareness.
That's why I'm organizing a 10K fun-run.
Of course,many of us will need wheelbarrows.
You are so brave.
And you are so understanding.
Most people just stare at me like I'm some kind of freak in reinforced underwear.
Poor,baby.
I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
- Jackpot!
- You want to get out of here?
Oh,I don't know.
This is all moving kind of fast.
Okay.
Oh,but before we go,I should mention my condition.
It's called:
I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General,I've got to say,
I don't think that's the real thing.
Okay,just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups for our friends.
- Hey,how did you two meet,anyway?
- No,we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants.
What?
Guys don't do that!
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!
What else are you allergic to,huh?
You owe me three hours for last night,Mosby.
I'm thinking,laser tag tournament in Newark this weekend.
Ted can pass for under 18,right?
It's a father-son thing.
Marshall,we should get going.
Any later,and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.
The Drunk Train?
It's the last train of the night back to Long Island.
It's a mess.
Just a bunch of drunk,sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
See you.
New plan,Ted.
So this father-son thing.
You know,a backwards baseball cap really youngs me down.
All aboard!
How.I.Met.Your.Mother S07E16
For Valentine's weekend,
Lily and Marshall invited Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont.
16 years together,and still so in love.
What's your secret?
The key to relationships is understanding the difference between hearing and listening.
- It's about respecting your partner's...
- Opinions on...
Kind of on a roll here.
Relationships are a give and take, and that's why it's important to never keep score.
Yeah,like how Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head.
If they were a couple,they'd never work.
Obviously.
Ted's a Taurus,and Barney is such a Scorpio.
Good advice.
Don't keep score.
They're not even close to finished.
How do we not keep score,you ask?
Sounds like somebody want to hear some examples,sweetie.
I'm just gonna close my eyes until it's all over.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Solid.
Here's one.
Every time Marshall's mom comes to visit us, we have to put out all the tacky Minnesota gifts she's bought us over the years.
- Hi,Mom!
- Hi,Mrs. Eriksen!
Marshall.
I don't see the gopher-hair tea cozy I made you.
Guess it wasn't good enough for Lily.
But I'd never hold that over Marshall, because if I did,he'd owe me big-time.
Just like I would never hold it over you for dragging me to that experimental theater piece.
Is it... is it just screaming?
just***
But we don't keep score.
Gotcha,loud and clear.
Don't keep score.
Because if we did,then Marshall would owe me for killing my cousin's dog.
How did I know that he would eat my wallet?
Why was your wallet filled with chocolate?
!
So we're back to this argument!
That night,Barney and I found ourselves in a strange,new universe called...
The Drunk Train.
Where has this heavenly vehicle been all my life?
Can you hear its inspiring chant,Ted?
I think I can get laid,I think I can get laid.
It's-it's The Little Engine with Wood,The Whore-ient Express.
The Long Island Tail Road!
Oh,I got one.
Thomas the Spank Engine!
Ted,that is a children's book.
Okay,as fun as this place is,it's late.
So,what's our play?
And don't say,"The Siamese Twins"" We're not stretching out another one of my jackets.
No,dude,this is the Drunk Train.
We don't need a play!
All we have to do is sit back,play it cool,scope out the hotties, and by the end of the line,we will totally be sleeping with someone.
three***
You know,you are so great.
You sat there listening to Marshall and Lily bicker all night, and you didn't complain once.
Well,I am a therapist,so I do plan on billing them.
I also have a couple powerful medications that might help.
- Lily can't take anything; she's pregnant.
- I meant for us.
If we're getting through five more meals and a sleigh ride with those guys, we need to be spaced out of our gourds.
Well,if we are keeping score,I owe you one weekend,mister.
I was thinking a little longer than that.
What do you mean?
Robin,will you marry me?
Look,I know this is fast.
I'm just excited to start a life with you.
If that's what you want.
I'm-I'm not saying no.
I'm-I'm not saying anything.
I just,um...
I-I need some time to think.
I totally understand.
Um,take as much time as you need.
I'll just,uh...
I'll just keep this here until you're ready.
- Any chance we could put that bad boy away for now?
- It's really just staring at us,isn't it?
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
I thought of some new great names for the Drunk Train.
Slamtrak!
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!
Thomas the Spank Engine!
- I said that one yesterday.
- I don't think you did.
Wow.
Someone's had some coffee.
Yeah. 18 cups!
There is no way I'm falling asleep tonight!
That Quinn girl is so wrong.
She said I could never love anything,but I love this train!
She said you could never love anything?
That's intense.
Oh,you have no idea.
Stop staring.
Not gonna happen.
Is there any way we can start over and get to know each other?
I already know you.
Oh,really?
- You wear a suit all the time.
- Obviously.
You have a stupid rule about everything.
I pay for the meal,you handle my deal.
That's just good manners.
But you end most nights alone at a strip club,feeling empty inside, telling yourself your life is somehow epic or classic or...
legendary.
I never say epic or classic.
Do you practice the dark arts?
No,they did not forget the potato salad in your takeout order!
Wh-What happened next?
!
For the last time,I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Your debt is paid.
You don't have to come on the Drunk Train anymore.
You're never gonna meet the one there,anyway.
- Oh,screw the one!
- What?
Every date I've been on lately has been brutal.
Last week,I went out with a girl whose favorite band was Glee.
Plus,it's almost Valentine's Day, and I'm alone without anything close to a girlfriend.
So... all aboard!
I have never been more proud of you.
Come on.
Ted,tonight is gonna be epic-- wait for it-- dary!
Wait.
No,that's not it.
How do I usually say it?
I hate this Quinn girl!
- Well,I propose we order a bottle of wine.
- Propose!
Not propose.
Suggest.
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily,take it.
Why don't we get an appetizer?
How about the... onion rings?
I mean,diamond rings.
I mean,diamond circles.
I mean,onion circles.
I know they're fattening, but I hear this place has great onion circles.
So,Robin,about not telling them?
The green salad looks interesting.
You're so much better without him.
If you ask me,Vinnie's a real jerk.
Hey,don't you dare badmouth Vinnie!
- So what do you do?
- Well,I teach architecture,and I also...
Oh,big man with a job.
You think yore better than me?
What...
So... where do you live?
I'm on the Upper West Side.
Oh,big man.
Living in Manhattan.
What,you think you're better than me?
You think you're better than me?
!
Well,it's a close one.

- See you in a minute.
- Okay.
So?
Are you any closer to deciding?
well,there is something you don't know.
Can you guys keep a secret?
- Yeah.
- Well,some of us can.
Well,there's something I have been keeping from everyone for the last couple of months.
I found out that I can't have children.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?
- I can't believe that we didn't know.
No,you know,I've had some... time to deal with this by myself,and...
I'm okay.
For real.
- Are you sure?

I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
Jackpot!
You want to get out of here?
Oh, I don't know.
This is all moving kind of fast.
Okay.
Oh, but before we go,
I should mention my condition.
It's called:
I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General, I've got to say,
I don't think that's the real thing.
Okay, just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups for our friends.
Hey, how did you two meet, anyway?
No, we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants.
What?
Guys don't do that!
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!
What else are you allergic to, huh?
You owe me three hours for last night, Mosby.
I'm thinking, laser tag tournament in Newark this weekend.
Ted can pass for under 18, right?
It's a father-son thing.
Marshall, we should get going.
Any later, and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.
The Drunk Train?
It's the last train of the night back to Long Island.
It's a mess.
Just a bunch of drunk, sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves.
Yeah.
Bye.
See you.
New plan, Ted.
So this father-son thing.
You know, a backwards baseball cap really youngs me down.
All aboard!
- For Valentine's weekend, Lily and Marshall invited
Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont.
Mmm.
16 years together, and still so in love.
- Mm.
- What's your secret?
The key to relationships is understanding the difference between hearing and listening.
It's about respecting your partner's...
Opinions on...
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Kind of on a roll here.
Relationships are a give and take, and that's why it's important to never keep score.
Yeah, like how
Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head.
If they were a couple, they'd never work.
Obviously.
Ted's a Taurus, and Barney is such a Scorpio.
Good advice.
Don't keep score.
They're not even close to finished.
How do we not keep score, you ask?
Huh.
Hm.
Sounds like somebody want to hear some examples, sweetie.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna close my eyes until it's all over.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Solid.
Here's one.
Every time Marshall's mom comes to visit us, we have to put out all the tacky Minnesota gifts she's bought us over the years.
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!
Marshall.
Uh-huh.
I don't see the gopher-hair tea cozy I made you.
Guess it wasn't good enough for Lily.
But I'd never hold that over Marshall, because if I did, he'd owe me big-time.
Just like I would never hold it over you for dragging me to that experimental theater piece.
Is it... is it just screaming?
But we don't keep score.
Gotcha, loud and clear.
Don't keep score.
Because if we did, then Marshall would owe me for killing my cousin's dog.
How did I know that he would eat my wallet?
Why was your wallet filled with chocolate?
!
So we're back to this argument!
That night, Barney and I found ourselves in a strange, new universe called...
The Drunk Train.
Hey!
Where has this heavenly vehicle been all my life?
Can you hear its inspiring chant, Ted?
I think I can get laid, I think I can get laid.
It's-it's The Little Engine with Wood,
The Whore-ient Express.
The Long Island Tail Road!
Oh, I got one.
Thomas the Spank Engine!
Ted, that is a children's book.
Okay, as fun as this place is, it's late.
So, what's our play?
And don't say, "The Siamese Twins""
We're not stretching out another one of my jackets.
No, dude, this is the Drunk Train.
We don't need a play!
All we have to do is sit back, play it cool, scope out the hotties, and by the end of the line, we will totally be sleeping with someone.
You know, you are so great.
You sat there listening to Marshall and Lily bicker all night, and you didn't complain once.
Well, I am a therapist, so I do plan on billing them.
I also have a couple powerful medications that might help.
Lily can't take anything;
she's pregnant.
I meant for us.
If we're getting through five more meals and a sleigh ride with those guys, we need to be spaced out of our gourds.
Well, if we are keeping score,
I owe you one weekend, mister.
I was thinking a little longer than that.
What do you mean?
Robin, will you marry me?
Look, I know this is fast.
I'm just excited to start a life with you.
If that's what you want.
Wow.
Um...
I'm-I'm not saying no.
I'm-I'm not saying anything.
I just, um...
I-I need some time to think.
I totally understand.
Um, take as much time as you need.
I'll just, uh...
I'll just keep this here until you're ready.
Any chance we could put that bad boy away for now?
It's really just staring at us, isn't it?
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
I thought of some new great names for the Drunk Train.
Slamtrak!
Uh-huh.
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!
Thomas the Spank Engine!
I said that one yesterday.
I don't think you did.
Wow.
Someone's had some coffee.
Yeah. 18 cups!
There is no way I'm falling asleep tonight!
That Quinn girl is so wrong.
She said I could never love anything, but I love this train!
She said you could never love anything?
That's intense.
Oh, you have no idea.
Stop staring.
Not gonna happen.
Is there any way we can start over and get to know each other?
I already know you.
Oh, really?
- You wear a suit all the time.
- Obviously.
You have a stupid rule about everything.
I pay for the meal, you handle my deal.
That's just good manners.
But you end most nights alone at a strip club, feeling empty inside, telling yourself your life is somehow epic or classic or...
legendary.
I never say epic or classic.
Do you practice the dark arts?
No, they did not forget the potato salad in your takeout order!
Wh-What happened next?
!
For the last time, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Your debt is paid.
You don't have to come on the Drunk Train anymore.
You're never gonna meet the one there, anyway.
- Oh, screw the one!
- What?
Every date I've been on lately has been brutal.
Last week, I went out with a girl whose favorite band was Glee.
Plus, it's almost Valentine's Day, and I'm alone without anything close to a girlfriend.
So... all aboard!
I have never been more proud of you.
Come on.
Ted, tonight is gonna be epic-- wait for it-- dary!
Wait.
No, that's not it.
How do I usually say it?
I hate this Quinn girl!
Well,
I propose we order a bottle of wine.
- Propose!
- Not propose.
Suggest.
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily, take it.
Why don't we get an appetizer?
How about the...
onion rings?
I mean, diamond rings.
I mean, diamond circles.
I mean, onion circles.
I know they're fattening, but I hear this place has great onion circles.
So, Robin, about not telling them?
The green salad looks interesting.
You're so much better without him.
If you ask me, Vinnie's a real jerk.
Hey, don't you dare badmouth Vinnie!
Ow!
So what do you do?
Well, I teach architecture, and I also...
Oh, big man with a job.
You think yore better than me?
What...
So... where do you live?
I'm on the Upper West Side.
Oh, big man.
Living in Manhattan.
What, you think you're better than me?
Ehhh!
Ehhhh!
You think you're better than me?
!
Well, it's a close one.
Lily made 14 awkward references to marriage, and Marshall made an even 60.
I'm so sorry, Kevin.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go to bed, but you guys think tomorrow we can stop with all the marriage talk?
I do.
I do.
That's a half a point each.
See you in a minute.
Okay.
So?
Are you any closer to deciding?
Ooh...
Uh... well, there is something you don't know.
Um...
Can you guys keep a secret?
Yeah.
Well, some of us can.
Well, there's something
I have been keeping from everyone for the last couple of months.
Um...
I found out that I can't have children.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
I can't believe that we didn't know.
No, you know, I've had some... time to deal with this by myself, and...
I'm okay.
For real.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
So... even though I love Kevin and I... think I want to say yes,
I can't until I tell him.
But I'm scared it'll end our relationship.
You know what, Robin?
If it's meant to be, then it won't matter.
Yeah, you just have to tell him.
Thank God we had the keys to Marshall and Lily's place.
Pretty sure I told you that before you kicked in that side window.
You mean, before the "burglars" kicked in that side window and stole all of Lily's underwear.
What the hell happened on that train?
It was absolute chaos.
Ted, when I was at M.I.T., my favorite Einstein quote was:
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."
You didn't go to M.I.T.
I didn't?
Huh.
I actually have no idea where you went to college.
Who are you?
If we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train, taking into account standard deviation, and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi, we can conclude...
Damn it, Ted!
I was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log.
I'll remember it.
The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret.
I know that this is a lot to process, so... you take all the time you need.
And I understand...
Robin... will you marry me?
Yes.
What are you doing?
The top speed of the Drunk Train is 73 miles per hour, and you factor in an aggregate of 32 boobs per car,
28 of which are motorboatable, and you divide that...
No, no, no!
This is all wrong!
It should be so simple!
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!
My God...
it's been right in front of us the whole time.
"Get drunk""
Yeah.
Of course.
Good circling, Ted.
This ain't my first word search.
So my Mom's already picked a date, venue and caterer for the wedding.
But nothing's set in stone.
My great-aunt's gonna sing.
That's happening.
Are you really okay with this?
Yeah, she's actually got a decent voice.
No, are you... are you okay with everything that we talked about?
Of course, Robin, I love you.
Besides, there are other ways to have kids.
There's adoption, surrogacy...
No, Kevin, it's not just that I can't have kids,
I don't want kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Knowing that, do you want to take your proposal back?
Will you marry me?
Oh, you take such good care of me.
Thanks for loaning me your shoes for my swollen feet.
Ah!
I owe you one.
We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Keeping score.
You're growing a baby, our baby.
So you're officially ahead of me for life.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Once we're parents, we have to be a team.
Deal?
It's your turn!
I was on point for six straight hours yesterday!
Two of those hours were a nap and you know it!
Let's go to the board!
I hope it's a soupy deuce, sucka.
Deal.
We're a team.
I was all, "Do I look like I'm from Ronkonkoma?
!"
Oh...!
That's all you gotta say!
Oh, oh, oh, big man with a briefcase!
What do you think, you're better than me?
!
Hey, our stop's next.
Do you want to join us?
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.
Too skanky.
Too skanky?
Eh...
It's the Drunk Train.
You crossed out all the stops and wrote "Vaginaville."
That's not true.
That one says "Boner Gardens."
What's going on?
Wait.
Did that Quinn girl shake your game or something?
Hell no!
At the end of the night...
You know, I went out tonight looking for a cheap, meaningless fling.
But you turned out to be so special.
I'd hate to ruin this friendship with sex.
Oh, oh, I am willing to take that risk.
Good one, Ted.
Anyway, I'm seriously contemplating purchasing a new ironing board.
Do you think...?
Okay, I'll give you this:
You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me.
That was pretty cool.
Yeah, you know, in retrospect, I think that was the moment you decided to come back to my place and get nasty.
Yeah, right.
Get up.
You're on my bra.
Sorry.
Where's your bathroom?
Past the kitchen, down the hall.
See, I feel like I would remember you two being naked on your couch in the middle of the club.
Oh, right.
That was later in my apartment after we got nasty.
My bad.
So, you want to go to a diner or something?
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?
I know, I know.
I'm late on sending the pictures.
I've been swamped.
You like Quinn.
I...
That's why you can't stop "complaining" about her.
That's why you just tanked our chance with these... lovely innocent flowers.
I don't even care where we go, but I hate doing it on the ground.
Barney, do you know why
I'm on the Drunk Train on Valentine's Day?
Because I have nothing better to do.
No one I can't stop thinking about.
So if you feel something for Quinn, go for it.
Because you're wasting your time here.
We both are.
I don't like Quinn!
Kevin, I love you, but please don't just be the nice guy who says the right thing.
Robin, I want to marry you no matter what.
Assuming you don't turn into a big fat fattie.
See?
Right there.
Don't always say the right thing.
Look, you just got a truckload of new information dumped on you.
Will you marry me?
My feelings on kids aren't gonna change.
Will you marry me?
Haven't you always wanted kids?
That was before I fell in love with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always had kids in it.
That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year or ten or 50, full of regret.
So...
I need you to be sure, okay?
If we get married, you will never have children.
Are you really okay with that?
Enormous Penis Syndrome?
E.P.S.
It's all about awareness.
That's why we're doing the fun run, the silent auction, the three-legged race.
Of course, that's just one guy.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You can let me out up here.
Why?
You got a girlfriend or something?
Maybe something.
Kids, sometimes you realize the journey you've been taking has reached its final stop.
Where do you go next?
Hey.
Are you okay?
♪ A year from now, we'll all be gone ♪
♪ All our friends will move away ♪
♪ And they're going to better places ♪
♪ But our friends will be gone away... ♪
So... he un-proposed.
♪ Nothing is as it has been...
We're over.
And I-I...
I-I know it's for the best.
It's just...
I was finally ready for something serious.
He seemed like the guy to take that next step with.
But he couldn't look past this.
I mean, who could?
I could.
I love you, Robin.
You've been complaining about this Barney guy so much,
I'm starting to think that you like him.
Like his apartment-- check.
Like his moves downtown-- check plus.
But like him?
Ugh.
Please.
I'm just surprised he doesn't recognize you.
He practically lives here.
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
Sorry this is taking so long.
He kicked for everybody else.
It's hard for the little guy to perform under pressure.
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night.
(laughter)
Whoa!
It was small, but I think I felt something.
Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
Stop laughing at it, Lily.
ALL:
Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
Can we please talk about something other than my wedding night?
Absolutely.
Let's talk about last night.
It was a night like any other.
I was just about to get laid...
Hey, Barney, I need your help.
This hottie I'm talking to is meeting her friend at a club, so I need a wingman.
Well, just so you know, I'd be giving up a sure thing here.
Hey!
Are you not a sure thing?
Yeah, I am.
This "friend" of yours better be even hotter and dumber than this one.
Wow!
You have Enormous Penis Syndrome?
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.
That's the problem with E.P.S.:
lack of awareness.
That's why I'm organizing a 10K fun-run.
Of course, many of us will need wheelbarrows.
You are so brave.
And you are so understanding.
Most people just stare at me like I'm some kind of freak in reinforced underwear.
Poor, baby.
I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
(coughs) Jackpot!
You want to get out of here?
Oh, I don't know.
This is all moving kind of fast.
Okay.
Oh, but before we go,
I should mention my condition.
It's called:
I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
As the former Surgeon General, I've got to say,

Okay, just stop.
You have no chance with me.
We're just here as backups for our friends.
Hey, how did you two meet, anyway?
No, we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants.

(chuckles) If we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train, taking into account standard deviation, and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi, we can conclude... (snoring)
Damn it, Ted!
I was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log.
(snoring) I'll remember it.
NARRATOR:
The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret.
I know that this is a lot to process, so... you take all the time you need.
And I understand...
Robin... will you marry me?
Yes.
What are you doing?
The top speed of the Drunk Train is 73 miles per hour, and you factor in an aggregate of 32 boobs per car,
28 of which are motorboatable, and you divide that...
No, no, no!
This is all wrong!
It should be so simple!
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!
My God...
it's been right in front of us the whole time.
"Get drunk""
Yeah.
Of course.
Good circling, Ted.
This ain't my first word search.
So my Mom's already picked a date, venue and caterer for the wedding.
But nothing's set in stone.
My great-aunt's gonna sing.
That's happening.
Are you really okay with this?
Yeah, she's actually got a decent voice.
No, are you... are you okay with everything that we talked about?
Of course, Robin, I love you.
Besides, there are other ways to have kids.
There's adoption, surrogacy...
No, Kevin, it's not just that I can't have kids,
I don't want kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Knowing that, do you want to take your proposal back?
Will you marry me?
Oh, you take such good care of me.
Thanks for loaning me your shoes for my swollen feet.
Ah!
I owe you one.
We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Keeping score.
You're growing a baby, our baby.
So you're officially ahead of me for life.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Once we're parents, we have to be a team.
Deal?
(baby crying) It's your turn!
I was on point for six straight hours yesterday!
Two of those hours were a nap and you know it!
Let's go to the board!
I hope it's a soupy deuce, sucka.
(chortles)
Deal.
We're a team.
I was all, "Do I look like I'm from Ronkonkoma?
!"
ALL:
Oh...!
That's all you gotta say!
Oh, oh, oh, big man with a briefcase!
What do you think, you're better than me?
!
(all laughing)
Hey, our stop's next.
Do you want to join us?
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.
Too skanky.
Too skanky?
Eh...
It's the Drunk Train.
You crossed out all the stops and wrote "Vaginaville."
That's not true.
That one says "Boner Gardens." (snickers)
What's going on?
Wait.
Did that Quinn girl shake your game or something?
Hell no!
At the end of the night...
You know, I went out tonight looking for a cheap, meaningless fling.
But you turned out to be so special.
I'd hate to ruin this friendship with sex.
Oh, oh, I am willing to take that risk.
Good one, Ted.
Anyway, I'm seriously contemplating purchasing a new ironing board.
Do you think...?
Okay, I'll give you this:
You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me.
That was pretty cool.
Yeah, you know, in retrospect, I think that was the moment you decided to come back to my place and get nasty.
(laughs) Yeah, right.
Get up.
You're on my bra.
Sorry.
(grunts)
Where's your bathroom?
Past the kitchen, down the hall.
See, I feel like I would remember you two being naked on your couch in the middle of the club.
Oh, right.
That was later in my apartment after we got nasty.
My bad.
So, you want to go to a diner or something?
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?
I know, I know.
I'm late on sending the pictures.
I've been swamped.
You like Quinn.
I...
That's why you can't stop "complaining" about her.
That's why you just tanked our chance with these... lovely innocent flowers.
I don't even care where we go, but I hate doing it on the ground.
Barney, do you know why
I'm on the Drunk Train on Valentine's Day?
Because I have nothing better to do.
No one I can't stop thinking about.
So if you feel something for Quinn, go for it.
Because you're wasting your time here.
We both are.
I don't like Quinn!
Kevin, I love you, but please don't just be the nice guy who says the right thing.
Robin, I want to marry you no matter what.
Assuming you don't turn into a big fat fattie.
See?
Right there.
Don't always say the right thing.
Look, you just got a truckload of new information dumped on you.
Will you marry me?
My feelings on kids aren't gonna change.
Will you marry me?
Haven't you always wanted kids?
That was before I fell in love with you.
Well, that's the thing.
Your future always had kids in it.
That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year or ten or 50, full of regret.
So...
I need you to be sure, okay?
If we get married, you will never have children.
Are you really okay with that?
Enormous Penis Syndrome?
E.P.S.
It's all about awareness.
That's why we're doing the fun run, the silent auction, the three-legged race.
Of course, that's just one guy.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You can let me out up here.
Why?
You got a girlfriend or something?
Maybe something.
NARRATOR:
Kids, sometimes you realize the journey you've been taking has reached its final stop.
So, the question becomes:
Where do you go next?
Hey.
Are you okay?
♪ A year from now, we'll all be gone ♪
♪ All our friends will move away ♪
♪ And they're going to better places ♪
♪ But our friends will be gone away... ♪
So... he un-proposed.
♪ Nothing is as it has been...
We're over.
And I-I...
I-I know it's for the best.
It's just...
I was finally ready for something serious.
He seemed like the guy to take that next step with.
But he couldn't look past this.
I mean, who could?
(sighs)
I could.
I love you, Robin.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
You've been complaining about this Barney guy so much,
I'm starting to think that you like him.
Like his apartment-- check.
Like his moves downtown-- check plus.
But like him?
Ugh.
Please.
I'm just surprised he doesn't recognize you.
He practically lives here.
ANNOUNCER:
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
(men whooping)
And...action.
When having friends over for lunch, show them that you really care, by incorporating some fresh flowers in your table scape.
I like to use something unconventional for a vase.
Like this old blender.
Isn't that unique?
And what a great conversation starter.
Think of what everyone will be saying about blenders and vases.
Voila!
Up next,
A few helpful hints on one of my favorite topics
Braising.
I'm Honey Garret and you're watching "A Little Bit of Honey".
And we're out!
Excuse me.
Ms. Garret.
Who are you?
I'm Nelson Dorkoff.
I hired you to cater my birthday party the other night.
Oh, right.
Well, I'm surprise you remember.
I haven't seen the guest of honor swill that much booze since I catered Liza Minelli's wedding to that gay troll.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
What are you doing, by the way?
Oh, we're doing a demo for the Food Network.
Oh my God.
Do you need a charismatic sidekick with tons of acting experience?
I carry these with me everywhere.
I see that you do.
But sorry, its a cooking show, not "The Biggest Loser".
Listen, Honey...
Don't get that familiar with me.
I don't know you.
I was just calling you by your name.
Oh, right.
Before you go back to taping,
I just wanted to ask you a few questions about night of the party.
Your food was delicious by the way.
Oh, what a doll!
Now, I don't need a sidekick.
But I would like people to stop by Honey's Kitchen.
Phil, roll...
Phil, get off the phone!
And role the camera!
Center yourself Honey.
And...action!
I'm back, and just like the Barefoot Contessa,
I like to have my gay queenie friends stop by the show as well.
And today I have Nelson.
And Nelson, I recently catered your 50th Birthday party.
40th Birthday.
If any casting directors are watching.
However, my age range is 30 to 50.
Apparently, my shrimp puffs were a huge hit.
Actually they were very few leftovers of anything, right?
I thought I went overboard preparing you know food for 100, but then these 20 very large men came by the party and really cleaned me out.
Now, Nelson, do you have any questions about my food?
Actually I do.
Where you around the food the entire night?
Oh, well course I was.
I prepared it.
Well, did you notice anybody suspicious around the food?
Could they have put something in it?
Gee, Nelson, I don't know what you are getting at.
I use only the freshest ingredients.
Listen, Honey.
I'm not friend, don't call me that.
I'm just calling her by name.
Miss Garrett.
Someone was murdered at our party.
And the police believe they were Poisoned.
By my food?
!
Maybe.
Oh my God!
Phil!
Cut it off!
Cut the Goddamn camera off.
Get Out here!
Get over here!
Are you trying to ruin me?
!
Huh?
Did Rachel Ray send you?
Huh?
Did she send you?
Because I happen to know that she's very threatened by me.
She will do anything in her power to make sure that my demo does not reach the executives at the Food Network!
That gravelly voiced bitch!
30 Minute Meal, my ass!
30 minutes, then got shit on your plate!
Then you got to eat it!
Calm down, Honey.
Don't patronize me!
I am NOT your honey....
Oh my God!
Did you just change your name to Honey?
Actually I did.
I needed something catchier than "A Little Bit O Agnes."
Look, I'm not accusing you of anything.
OK?
But I have to know.
Do you recognize this guy?
Because he was poisoned at our party that YOU catered.
I've never seen him before in my life.
And I certainly didn't poison him.
And, I did not hire any waiters.
I served everything myself.
So it could not be my food.
The only person I hired was the bartender.
What's his name?
Todd Stevens.
Hot Toddy?
Oh, ya ya.
He was hot!
And he was the only straight guy there.
He was flirting with me ALL night.
Okay, that's impossible.
Because he's gay, and he's sleeping with me.
Oh, sweetie, oh my oh... you ARE an actor.
What a crock!
He is!
And, I'm nuts about him...
OK, crazy!
Well, you just live in that fantasy land that you got up there in that noodle.
And, if you're through accusing me of murder.
Then I'd like to get back to my demo.
You Crazy Mother Fucker!
Jesus Phil, roll camera.
We're losing light.
He was bar tending that night?
Terrific.
Reggie and Wood are going to have a field day with this.
I don't feel like going.
Let's go.
Let's go.
You.
Can't be just like that.
Why not?
I came here because I wanted to become her dongsaeng.
I have already told you not to call her Noona.
But Eun Dong...
If you do it like this,
Will she really see me as man?
Of course...
~I'm here to find Teacher Im Bora.~
Starting from today, I won't call you teacher again.
Miss Bora.
~I don't want to go to the school without you being there.~
~but I also can't transfer to another school.~
Because, this is a woman university.
~I'm requesting for a date.~
If you agree, then please make a heart sign on the top of your head.
You're dead.
What is it?
What?
Geum Eun Dong, really.
Why are you looking at Apple head?
Just to celebrate, today's my treat.
Very good.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Year 2012 National Youth group.

Super thin, sensitive model, 50% waterproof condom.
Where did you get these from?
Secret.
Come.
This is sign of us growing up.
Eun Dong.
Let me make your pure and innocent soul to become mature.
All of you better hurry and enjoy this remaining innocence.
Wimpy Kid.
Hyeong nim is leaving first.
why is it so thin?
this was drawed many times to be made into this.
Just bringing a medal like a size of a 500 won coin.
But what is the ring for?
begging for a relationship?
or a 100 days commemoration?
no... or for a 1st year anniversary?
why being so childish?
Then why is that your ring so childish?
Even if I melt your medal bit by bit, it still doesn't come out pretty.
Look.
I used my effort to make this ring.
I used my years of swimming experience to get the medal and created a ring out of it will the receiver be moved too?
She will be very happy,right?
Middle school student.
what's wrong?
You bought a ring?
A 14k one, right?
not really.
Hey!
there's some sand on it.
Otherwise, just cut open stomach to get it.
So hot.
So hot.
Hot Hot Hot.
So hot.
Am I disfigured?
You see.. you are really lively when making troubles.
I'm really confused right now.
while, you are still being able to sleep?
Wife.
What is upsetting you?
Our Eun Dong won the championship at the swimming competition.
And tomorrow is his engagement.
I feel so wronged by doing all these household duties everyday.
now they even wanted to sell our son.
Are you still so happy about it?
Happy?
Happy?
Happy?
It hurts.
Don't be sad anymore.
Just endure abit more.
Next time, I will get you a big diamond ring.
So, during this period of time, you just look at your handsome husband face and endure abit more.
the face of bear which couldn't be able to afford your son's education costs.
And the diamond ring..
Rather than waiting for that,
Might as well just live my life looking at your handsome face.
Is it delicious?
delicious?
delicious?
delicious?
delicious?
It's painful.
Delicious, Delicious, Delicious, Delicious.
What are you doing?
It is very hot.
You came out?
Is the engagement ceremony all prepared smoothly?
Yes.
It is all prepared perfectly.
Daughter-in-law.
Tomorrow is the engagement.
Don't be sad anymore.
Our Eun Dong is still too young, not really suitable for the engagement.
Plus there's still many things to do, so I'm not really willing.
But this is the agreement between the family clans.
so I just obey to it.
Mom,
Do you have anything eat?
That kind of oily and smooth food.
Why are you always looking for oily food today?
Even your dinner was mixed with sesame oil while eating.
Okay.
Say ah!
But Eun Dong,
Didn't you get any medal or something?
What?
Yes.
Winning at such a huge competition, don't you even get a medal?
I donated it to the school.
What?
!
My son worked so hard to get the medal.
Why the school just take it away like that?
Aigoo!
Wife.
Wife.
It's so strange. there's obviously something going on.
Do you think that our honest son is like you?
Just to sell that to seal up your mouth?
Mouth, mouth, mouth, mouth.
Let you be full of passion.
Mom,
Could you knock on the door?
I'm also a man now.
why you're sitting on the chamber pot in the room?
Because of something so I'm sitting on it.
Eun Dong.
You better be honest.
That fox spirit who is 7 years older than you and wearing all that heavy makeup to show off everyday.
Do you really like her?
Mom.
There's a sign.
Quickly.
Quickly.
Mom,
Mom,
I know...
I know...
Turn it off now!
Grandmother!
Ha Soon Shim, Did you forgot that today is the agreement with granny?
Didn't I say before?
Today, I have an Important schedule.
You really like the schedule?
You only have a schedule today.
Look at you, what are you even wearing?
Is your thighs like chicken thighs or pig trotters?
Who're you thinking of giving to eat?
Showing it off and dancing here.
Come with me quickly.
Quickly.
I'm a public figure.
Do you think that my schedule is like going with granny to the old folk's home?
Even if you put a knife on my neck today,
I will still complete my schedule.
so, granny.. you return home first.
If you're not going with granny now,
I will sharpen the knife on your behalf on your neck.
Understand?
There isn't much time.
Granny!
Granny!
Here, I approve the engagement between the Geum family's Eun Dong and the Ha family's Soon Shim.
It is because of a long time agreement between the families.
so because of this, both of you need to accept it happily.
Becoming each other's other half in the future.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Ha Soon Shim.
Where did you learn this from?
So clumsy..
still not redoing it again?
Why?
Just let her off.
Lady Baek.
This is the wine which is drunk between the two family's engagement.
After drinking this wine, Both of you are officially pronounced as fiancé and fiancée.
And also becoming an adult.
Granny, when can I drink that cup of wine?
Eun Dong ah...
Just wait a while more.
If it's like that, our Soon Shim will become your other half for the rest of her life.
Granny.
Can't I drink the wine next time?
Eun Dong is still young, so he can't be drinking.
This cup of wine is because of the both families' agreement, so you all must drink it.
Aigoo!
It hurts.
Soon Shim ah...
What's wrong with this?
Soon Shim ah..
Where are you painful?
Aigoo.
Child.
Are you all right?
How are we going to do about this?
Let's get your clothes removed first.
Granny.
You just let Eun Dong stay with me for a moment.
Of course.
Of course.
It's good.
While I'm uncomfortable, what is compared to the bridegroom as being the best medicine?
Let's all go out.
Go out.
Soon Shim ah, Are you alright?
During indigestion, you need to press here as hard as possible.
Feeling better now?
I knew it is like this.
Where you going?
Grandmother!
Eun dong ah, I beg you.
Today is really important.
How about Noona giving you a kiss?
Kiss on your mouth.
Eun Dong ah, Thank you.
Don't care already.
Even if I return, I'm going to die for sure.
Today is really important.
Quick.
Quick.
Quick.
Quick.
Last week, the late CLS group ex-chairman Lee's inheritance was exposed.
And the granddaughter of Chairman Lee who's inheriting it, had returned back.
Inheritor Lee Tae Ri, who had accepted the best education in Italy, will not only become Group CLS biggest shareholder.
and had even brought back a cultural relic which had a history of 200 years from abroad.
becoming a figure who's making the headlines now.
It is because the company which is in-charged, is the biggest transport company in the country.
So it attracts even more attention.
If she's going to put it at the museum,
The Relic and the Cultural Arts world will create a big uproar.
Keep it.
What?
Umbrella.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?
Your phone is also not getting through.
I already said that we wouldn't be able to do a rehearsal.
And you arrived late even though it's a live broadcast today.
what's with your clothes anyway?
It's the trend.
Let's go.
Ajussi.
Have some manners, please?
Who is he?
Fan.
I'm leaving.
Ha Soon Shim.
You must keep the promise, understand?
It isn't Apple Head...
Didn't you say we're conducting the opening ceremony?
Yes.
We prepared it earlier.
Who...?
It's the manager who prepared it personally.
The manager who didn't consult me or meet with me, made the decision on his own?
Call him.
Curator Lee Tae Ri.
Yes.
Long time no see, Curator.
Was it you?
the one who's making the decision on your own.
Yes.
I feel that you shouldn't have time to prepare all these.
why must you trouble yourself so much?
I have just started work in Dae Dong Museum on Monday.
Whether it is at CLS Group or anywhere, I feel that I should at least do something for you.
I originally wanted to introduce myself earlier, but I couldn't because I wasn't sure when were you returning from abroad.
Hold the opening ceremony first then I will greet you formally.
You... a dung-eating housefly?
Going everywhere..
Eating everything...
You're just a nobody and only knows how to talk big.
Is this how you live your life?
Cancel the opening ceremony.
You must do it.
You are the main figure today.
Tell them that Lee Tae Ri is back.
so, they will need to be careful and concentrate on their work.
At least, let them know who's the owner of the museum.
Don't think of others.
Think for yourself first.
That is the correct way.
You disappeared suddenly the last time, then now you come to worry about me.
Why?
Because I became the successor, so your thoughts became different, right?
Tae Ri.
This is my way.
To put you right first.
And what I'm going to do, I will do it myself.
Go cancel the opening ceremony.
Choi Seung Jae ssi...
Don't appear by my side again,
Or you could just go to CLS Group to get a job.
Compared to here, there are more food there for you to eat.
It's me.
Is everything ready?
Where did I lose it?
Manager, why did you came back here?
I've come to ask you for a favor.
Today's program schedule need abit of changes.
I want you all to do the opening.
Why is it the opening?
Changing the program's schedule without a reason, isn't it very rude?
I'm relying on you.
Today's ceremony... must certainly be interesting.
Why?
It seems that I need to listen to your explanation first.
As the Apple Head's leader.
Are you alright?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Really....
What's this all about?
Soon Shim.
Ha Soon Shim.
Who's that brat anyway?
What's wrong today?
Not only changing the schedule and still beg us to do the opening.
You're getting less attractive already.
I don't have time to chat with you.
Quick, Let's go.
Hold on.
What're you doing?
The Apple Head's first kiss.
As a gift for the 100 days commemoration.
Even if I'm on stage together with them, I will still be incomparable.
Ha Soon Shim.
This is the company.
What mattered to me most, is being together with Oppa.
So don't be so cold,
If not, I won't want to do the opening.
Then don't do it!
Oppa.
Although I can understand that because of ambition, you became ignorant.
But I'll not put up with you by using your work as an excuse to threaten me.
I'm leaving.
Oppa, don't you really know my feelings for you?
Can't you even accept this bit of expression?
Understanding your heart and accepting your expression needs timing too.
I'll retire.
Not joking.
I'm thinking of retiring to become Oppa's woman and lead a common lifestyle in the future.
In the past, other than being a singer,
I've never thought of others but after I've met Oppa, it became different.
I'm already like this.
Won't you be moved by me abit?
Not moved, there's no reason to see each other again.
What?
Being a dream lover of thousands, saying that one wants to be with you together forever.
How can one not be moved?
Isn't it?
Afraid that you will not be queen anymore, so you rehearsed a vicious role in the wee hours.
Just because of a man whom you have known for a 100 days, you retire.
I don't want to face you with a heart full of gratitude.
and I don't like a heart full of compensating attitude of you when facing me.
Even if I die?
Even if I go up on stage now and dance until I die, will you still hate it?
Wouldn't you like me?
Didn't you say that your dream was to die on stage?
Don't cry.
I'll protect you.
Because you're my woman.
What was it?
It's just a child?
I'm sorry.
The model of a callow, wimpy kid.
which is the disobedient kind.
I'm not.
Then, I'll just call you "Youngster".
But, Youngster, How did you came in?
This is a prohibited area.
I don't know that this is a restricted area.
You cried?
This place is not for you to be moved or sad until you cry.
Tell me.
Surely it wasn't the museum that made you cry?
No, it is not.
What's that?
I'm heart brokened.
I'm very sad.
The person that I like doesn't like me.
I feel like I'm the saddest person in the world.
How old are you?
14 years old.
Oh my god!
You...
You're abnormally mature.
This kind of sadness shouldn't be experienced by a 14 year old.
What have you learnt in school today which is useful?
Who will become the new class monitor tomorrow?
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
What is it that makes you happy in the museum?
All these thoughts are the responsibility and obligation of a 14 year old.
Therefore.
That kind of sadness just stop it here now.
Although I'm a 14 year old, but I'll still feel excited.
Hurt.
Anger.
Sadness.
just when I think of that person, my heart will be like a cricket that sounds non-stop.
How can I act as if nothing had happened?
Bye.
Just enjoy it yourself,
Anyway, the most helplessness in life is regret.
What to do?
Manager.
What to do without Soon Shim?
Where's Soon Shim?
I don't know either.
We can't do without Soon Shim.
What's happening?
Where's the Curator's positioning?
I'm looking for it currently.
What's wrong?
Are you alright?
I don't like darkness.
Please grab hold of my hand.
You can feel better that way.
Soon Shim.
It's alright now.
Hold on.
What're you doing?
Because it's stained.
Tae Ri.
Hurry, open it up.
Are you alright?
What's with you?
The entrance had stated that it's prohibited.
Didn't you see it?
No, I didn't.
What?
Were you alone during the blackout?
I was with her.
What kind of a security guard are you?
I have said not let anyone come in.
Take him away to verify his identity.
After that, Investigate how did he came in here.
Let go!
Director...
You called up the idols that gives hopes and dreams unexpectedly.
By using your boring methods,
What exactly you could help me here with, Manager Choi Seung Jae?
Today is the museum's opening.
I absolutely couldn't put up with the vandalism of the undisclosed cultural relic.
Nobody vandalised it.
This child protected me.
so, don't treat him harshly.
If you're having difficulties, feel free to contact me.
Lee Tae Ri.
Yes.
Lee Tae Ri.
That's my name.
My mother gave birth to me in Italy.
I don't give out my business card to anyone easily.
Therefore, you can find me anytime.
I'll remember you.
Life is a risk.
Love is a promise.
Never forget that.
Only then, you can become a good man.
A man who will not harm but protect the woman.
Stop there.
You can't hit the child who's doing sports.
Stop there.
Stop right there!
Stop beating.
Stop beating.
Quick say it.
Where did you brought her to?
You see.
He's still young and he isn't willing to be engaged.
You let her return back just like that?
There should be a reason for it.
Right, Eun Dong?
Reason.
What reason?
That Soon Shim who's rude and a show off, couldn't even be matched with our Eun Dong.
That kind who's grown up and still doesn't know her manners.
A woman who just knows how to throw flirtatious glances anywhere,
Simply just can't be matched with our Eun Dong.
That's enough!
Soon Shim is not that kind of person.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I don't like listening to mom scolding Soon Shim.
I've said it already when my son's married to a wife, he forgets his mother.
I'm not going to live anymore.
Aigoo.
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)
Honey.
Honey.
Marrying to me, this kind of husband,
Your mother is worried almost every moment.
How can you say this to her?
Of course, she will be angry.
I'm wrong, Father.
Send this to your coach tomorrow.
and say that it's abit late, sorry.
After that, send this over too.
It's your mother who spent the entire night doing it.
It really makes people puzzled.
Puzzled.
Are you from heaven?
Why isn't there a place which you look ugly in?
Really.
Don't have Kimchi again.
Coach.
You came.
Eating instant noodles again?
Your Coach's time is gold.
Gold.
Needing to recruite new members.
and check the training schedule.
Eating instant noodles is a privilege to me already.
This is last week's training fee.
It's not easy to earn money.
Mother let me pass this to you.
You, this brat.
This really is good stuff.
Why does this radish grows so sexily?
Eun Dong ah..
According to my intentions, thinking that
Everytime I receive a bucket of kimchi from your mother.
I need not recieive any training fees from you for a lifetime.
But you should also know that coaching you is not easy.
Cheers!
Coach.
Seeing my woman kissing another man.
What should I do?
Kill off.
Both of them.
Coach, I'm really pathetic.
It just happened before my eyes but I didn't do anything.
I only looked at them.
I'm really useless, right?
I'm the one who will just see my woman wear the shoes and handbag that I bought and kiss others
Just before my eyes.
Eun Dong, then I'll just go forward to snatch the shoes and handbag back.
Eventually, Will they be able to kiss?
Shameless fellows.
I felt too ashamed and sorry for myself.
I really want to just disappear like that.
Forget about her.
I'm going crazy.
Why can't she understand my heart?
Originally, You can't really fulfill your satisfaction is swimming and woman.
What are you doing?
By doing a handstand, my tears will roll back.
You this brat.
People live just to vent it out.
When you want to vent, you vent.
When you want to cry, you cry.
If I cry now, I'll be more pathetic.
Eun Dong ah, you just make a wish to this and start all over again.
God knows..
Seeing you this sad today,
There's a possibility that someone can make your wish come true.
Have I drunk too much beer?
~ Tell me your wish. ~
Please let me protect my love.
~Your wish has been accepted.~
~During the solar eclipse, Your wish will come true.~
What?
Is it spoilt?
~But when your wish is fulfilled, you will lose something precious in life.~
Grandfather.
I've come.
come back late.
Grandfather, when you passed away, I wanted to see you badly.
I'm sorry.
I came when I've just returned to korea.
Because I didn't participate the burial, so I wanted to bid you farewell properly.
But there's lots of people.
I'm very confused.
Regarding my memory of Korea, it still stayed at that time when I was 14 years old.
But Grandfather, you're already dead.
What should I do?
Where should I go?
I feel like the whole world is in darkness.
Therefore, I went to eat ice cream.
The ice cream that we ate together.
Did the world's sweetest farewell.
Grandpa,
Could you fulfill my wish?
I want to have a friend.
That kind who's able to hold my hand warmly.
A true friend.
Why must it be a child?
Grandpa,
I'll come again.
Quick, say it.
I'm very busy.
Ha Soon Shim, do you have anything to say to me?
Nothing.
I'm going to Australia today.
Representing the school to compete and to do some professional training.
Is that so?
Have a safe trip then.
Ha Soon Shim, how can you do this to me?
That?
I'll just give it to you now.
Aigoo.
Are you mad?
Ain't you letting go?
Ha Soon Shim.
Why must you be engaged to me?
Ignoring my presence like this, why must you be engaged to me?
Eun Dong.
I'm very tired today and I'm feeling lousy too.
Therefore, don't come here to show off, just leave.
After you've returned, noona will accompany you to play games and exercise.
Ha Soon Shim.
I'm very uncertain now.
Therefore, you must grab hold of me tightly.
Are you joking now?
Originally, I'm depressed until I'm going to explode.
Why did you still come to provoke me?
Wake up.
Do you think that all the man in the world is like me?
Will they be like me that understand your good and see your weakness?
Therefore, don't think of others.
Just think of me will do.
Just look at my heart that only contains you.
Endure a bit more.
Here.
Take this to buy some delicious food.
Our Eun Dong, Eat more.
Grow up quickly and return back, okay?
I'll wait for you.
Geum Eun Dong, what's wrong with you?
You really are the world's second thinnest person I've seen.
Before I go, I want to take a look at the record.
Eun Dong, if people change, their life will be hard.
Therefore,
This brat, Why is he so fast?
Coach, How much is my record?
Coach.
Coach.
Who are you?
I'm Eun Dong, Coach.
Help me.
Spare me my life!
Coach, what are you doing?
I'm Eun Dong.
Ah..really... you this brat.
What did you do with our Eun Dong?
You, this bastard.
Please, spare me this time.
This really...
Didn't you see all that?
I was swimming.
I became like this after swimming.
Coach, what to do?
Coach.
Coach.
You.
Who are you?
I'm Eun Dong.
Eun Dong.
Spare me...
Please spare me this time.
What's wrong with you?
I'm really Eun Dong.
Ah..really...
You, brat.
What did you do with our Eun Dong?
You, this bastard.
Please, spare me this time.
Coach, Didn't you see all that?
I was swimming, then...
I became like this after swimming.
Ahhhh.....
Wear this first...
Coach,What do I do?
The clothes are too small.
ohh... the bus has arrived...
Soo Bin...
Hye Gi...
Hey.
Don't you both know who am I?
This is me. me.
Is it possible
You are the new coach?
Then, was our coach Hwang Min Guk dismissed?
Alright!
I'm not the coach, ok?
hey.. hey.. hey...
You.
Both of you...
Have you all prepared the equipments for training?
Haven't overlook anything?
-We have.
-It's Eun Dong...
Coach, why isn't Eun Dong here yet?
ah...
Eun Dong's uncle came on his behalf.
Eun Dong said that something cropped up and couldn't come today.
No....
I have to go to the swimming.....
Then, Will Eun Dong not be participating this coming competition?
Ya...
You all leave first.
Don't worry about Eun Dong anymore.
No matter what,
Coach will get Eun Dong there before the competition starts.
Quick.
Leave quickly, you, this brat.
Hey, Soo Bin..., Hye Gi....
Leave together....!
Coach, Please let me out...
I must go there now.
I must go there too.
Our National Junior Swimming Competition Champion,
Our Eun Dong is the rising new star.
And I, Hwang Min Gook,
Would become a well known coach one day.
While being on the road to a bright future,
But,
Why did you let our Eun Dong disappear suddenly?
disappearing suddenly?
I'm really Eun Dong...
Ah.
Right.
Coach, You were drinking beer last night.
After that, you ate the kimchi my mother made.
Could it be... that you only like young boys, so our Eun Dong.....
It's not.
It's Soon Shim.
Apple Head.
Could it be that you're Apple Head's manager?
I'm not.....
No..., then who're you exactly?
Are you the person-in-charge?
Or their hardcore fan?
Otherwise, her husband or what?
Husband?
Could it be possible at that time....
Please release me first.
Before I find Eun Dong, You'll be staying in there first.
I don't have much time.
You must find Eun Dong first, to participate in the competition, right?
Aigoo, aigoo...
Oppa!
Oppa!
Oppa!
Me?
Yes.
Oppa.
Our shop is hosting a coffee tasting event for this new flavour.
That.
Could I borrow your phone for a moment?
Ohh!
Of course....
You're so handsome.
Like to have a cup of coffee before your meal?
But I don't have a habit of drinking coffee.
Furthermore, drinking coffee before a meal is not good for the body.
Thank you so much.
Can't you drink it after your meal?
I'm working here until 7pm today.
We could eat and drink coffee later.
How about that?
Ha Soon Shim.
I, Oppa, will be coming.
Yes?
Manager Choi, Are you coming to my autograph session?
Sorry.
My company's public relations team will be there on my behalf.
So, I'll not be going.
I'll congratulate your success beforehand.
Then, I'll just cancel the autograph session.
=I'm going to hang up the phone.=
Turn back.
we'll speak again when we meet.
Any damages done?
It seems like it was damaged by humans.
Human?
Yes, Curator.
Generally speaking, the damages on the relic is because of oxidization and weathering over the years.
But under this kind of circumstances,
It's bound to be someone who touched it beforehand and let these details change so naturally.
Where's Manger Choi Seung Jae?
On the way to the autograph session currently.
What?
Heard that the contract model is holding an autograph session.
Careful.
It's limited edition.
Why are you always so naughty?
I wanted to behave like a poser and see how is it too.
You made such a busy person to find time to come here and sign autographs.
While being the person who's organizing, didn't even show up once?
There's nothing which I'm more disgusted by this.
Get the autograph session done first, then we'll talk.
Either You apologize
Or you can expain for yourself.
Otherwise, you can coax me too.
Let's talk it out here.
Then, I'll go for the autograph session.
No need.
You don't need to go for the autograph session anymore.
From now onwards, All the promotions related to you will be terminated.
Oppa, don't you really know why am I doing this?
I don't care whatever reason why you did all these actions.
From now onwards, everything have ended.
Using work as an excuse for your own private interests, interfering normal working operations.
This kind of behaviour, accepting it or amend it.
It's none of my business.
Is that alright if I go for the autograph session?
I'll do the signing seriously.
Manager Choi, I hope that you'll follow the order of the procedure.
First, I'll apologize.
Then, I'll accept anything you said willingly.
Soon Shim ah!
Soon Shim ah!
Hello, Uncle.
Soon Shim ah, Don't you recognize me?
I know.
You're my uncle fan.
Uncle, what's your name?
Eun Dong, Geum Eun Dong.
You've the same name as the person I knew.
Soon Shim ah, Could you speak with me for a moment now?
This is an extremely serious matter.
You can say it here.
Engagement?
Originally, I wanted to keep this secret in my heart.
Doesn't it matter if I say it here?
Chief.
Have I kept you waiting?
The autograph session has ended later than expected.
No.
I'm alright.
I've waited for 14 years just to be engaged to you.
This bit is just nothing.
Are you joking?
The engagement.
Soon Shim ah, I feel that it's because of the engagement that I become like this.
but, why didn't you change?
I'm fine, of course.
It's because I didn't have any sort of engagement before.
Soon Shim ah, take a look at me carefully.
Can't you really see who am I?
This deep eyes, Sharp nose and this sexy lips.
Plus, these cute pair of ears.
ah, right.
There's a mole behind my neck.
Hey, Ha Soon Shim.
Ajussi, what are you doing?
You.
Practiced dancing like crazy last year and got callus on your foot.
Isn't it because of this that you ordered me around everyday?
Ain't I the only one who knew this?
Right, You've it now too.
You've callus on your foot now too.
Get away from me!
ah, it hurts.
You knew it, right?
I don't know.
The security cameras malfunctioned suddenly.
It was published before the working hours.
And it's still DaDong Daily News.
Isn't you that created the problem intentionally.
Oppa!
ah, Soon Shim.
Oppa.
Who's this woman?
How could she shout like this at oppa?
I'm Song Seung Jae's boss.
This lady whose rude and have no proper upbringing...
Who are you anyway?
Me?
I'm the company's exclusive model.
Soon Shim.
Let's go out first.
Curator, really sorry.
Ajussi.
Don't touch Soon Shim.
If you dare touch her, you'll get it from me.
Seeing him so helpless,
Why did you still call him Oppa?
Who are you?
me?
It's not necessary to know.
Ms. Lee Tae Ri, Please don't feel sad for him.
It's not worth it for this man.
I saw it.
About what you were doing last night in the museum..
From the start to finish, thoroughly.
Hey, Ha Soon Shim, Wake up!
You're my woman already.
Soon Shim.
Geum Eun Dong.
You actually dare to leak out the news of our engagement and callus growth.
You're dead when you return back.
Soon Shim.
Soon Shim.
Quick, leave.
Quickly, quickly.
Soon Shim.
Soon Shim.
Remember to call me.
certainly.
Extremely sorry, Vice President.
Because I'm attending an event, so I didn't receive your call on time.
Curator Lee Tae Ri.
didn't know about it completely and got a fright.
But I didn't know that you got it published in the newspapers.
Yes, I understand.
Find me those videos of last night.
Don't overlook any corners.
How about the inside of the exhibition hall?
The site is under construction currently, so there's no video.
I saw it.
About what you were doing last night in the museum.
From the start to finish, thoroughly.
Help me find a person.
The man who's wearing a blue sportswear at the hall just now.
Find him quickly.
Coach!
You.
Where did you go exactly?
Our Eun Dong...
Didn't you say that you'll find Eun Dong for me?
Coach.
Did a person called Soon Shim gave you a call?
ah, you really are, a crazy bastard.
Using my number to hook up on girls, right?
I'm calling the police to get you.
You...
It's me.
Eun Dong!
Coach.
You, this brat.
Coach.
wa... this is completely the girls' killer.
That's why...
If I miss this competition, then my life will be totally over.
Swimming and Soon Shim too.
Everything will end.
Is this a joke?
Are you joking this time?
Just go to australia.
The flight is the day after tomorrow at noon.
Believe me.
Before that, you will be able to change back.
What do I do if I got found out?
Don't worry.
I told your mother that you're on the plane already.
I told the school that you've some problems at home and will join the team thereafter.
Don't need to think about anything now, just find a way to change back.
I know, Coach.
There's not much time.
Quick.
You become like that while swimming this morning.
Then,
Who are you?
Happy Birthday.
Tae Ri.
Hong Sil.
Tae Ri!
It's really delicious.
Hong Sil.
I heard that when you're recruited by KS and was coming to Korea,
I thought it's fake and didn't take it seriously
My mother said that.
Her heartless baby got cheated to korea by the crafty swindler enterprise.
She was very worried for me.
That time.
Why?
Ah..
It's Soon Shim.
She makes people unhappy sometimes.
Because she's too perfect.
Sings well.
Dances well.
Had a great body figure and a beautiful face.
Also good in acting.
She's the top income earner in our group.
Like the money tree completely.
Maybe that's why Soon Shim dislikes me.
What's with her?
Is she bullying you?
That girl?
No, Tae Ri.
No.
Soon Shim is the leader of our group.
That's why.
Hong Sil.
Tell me all of your schedule.
You need to tell me.
Especially, When you're with the group of rude dried green beans.
Starting from now, I'll be protecting you.
Tae Ri.
Coach, what is it exactly?
Why I became like this?
Phone.
Coach, help me say a pray together.
Dear God, please change our Eun Dong back.
I beg you.
Hey, Did you pray seriously?
I was praying to God to change me back just now.
What is it exactly?
After drinking this cup of wine,
Both of you will be officially engaged.
Ah, my stomach.
The wine.
It's the cup of wine.
There's a possibility that it's because I drank the cup of wine.
What wine?
The wine I drank at the engagement that time.
Great grand father told me that's the sign of becoming an adult there's still that kind of wine.
Yes.
But I drank it, Sun Sim didn't.
That's why I become like this.
Where are you able to buy that wine?
At my house.
Both of us should be at Australia, so we couldn't show up immediately.
Does your mother exercises in the morning?
Who are you?
Mom,
Who are you?
Why are you appearing in my son's room?
I'm sorry.
Husband?
Husband?
You.
Who are you?
What're you doing?
Catch him for me.
Those people who attended the event that night, are all there?
Is that so?
Yes, Manager.
Had this video been seen by the Curator?
I heard that she saw the video after the publication on the newspaper.
Hey, Coach.
How is it?
I've brought the wine out.
You did well.
You, this brat.
=Then now, get to the studio immediately.= The studio?
Yes, You brat.
I've checked up Apple head's fansite for their schedule for you.
There isn't any computers at home, my phone was with you.
Therefore, I came to school to check up this morning.
Thank you so much , Coach.
Get her to drink the wine quickly.
There isn't much time.
Get there quickly.
Yes.
Why my mother always wants to buy this kind of ahjussi style?
Those who drink the tears of princess, will be free from tiredness.
We choose Vitamin E.
Cut!
Good.
Let's rest first.
Come everybody.
Let's eat.
Soon Sim, eat something first.
There's your favourite Ddeokbokki.
Hey, Hong Sil.
How can you eat that much?
If you want to maintain your appearance, please control your appetite.
That attitude, what's with her again?
Why is she throwing her temper on our Hong Sil?
Don't be like that, Mimi.
I saw that she's really crying just now.
Maybe she's having some problems.
What problem?
She just wants look pretty in the shoot, so she's not using the eye drops and just enduring it.
Is that right?
that's why she's the poisonous tumour.
There's someone outside looking for you.
What brings you here?
I just knew that you're a great figure after seeing the news.
I've something to ask you, so I came over.
Where should I start?
My relationship with Seung Jae Oppa.
Not Choi Seung Jae.
It's the man who's with you, wearing the blue sportwear, at the autograph session.
You really make me more surprised everytime.
What's with that uncle?
You also surprised me.
That uncle?
Surprising.
Why he become an uncle?
It feels like it's more than a uncle-niece relationship.
It's not ordinary relationship.
That uncle likes me very much.
Give me your uncle's contact number to me.
But I've a condition,
A condition?
Manager Choi Song Jae.
Get him fired.
It's an attractive condition.
but could I know the reason?
I don't like Choi Song Jae being at Unnie's side.
This makes me very unhappy
If Seung Jae oppa gets fired, I will tell you my uncle's contact number.
Isn't it simple?
Yes.
Firing Choi Seung Jae compared to teaching you a lesson is much simpler.
What to do?
Choi Seung Jae is not willing to leave me.
I'm asking you that uncle's contact number.
It's to get Choi Seung Jae fired too.
It's a pity.
ah.., right.
That perfume.
Doesn't suit you.
To you, a 20-something year old,
The fragrance is too excessive.
Too heavy.
Did you see the note at my car?
Oh.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
You.Miss Lee Tae Ri.
What are you doing here?
I'm meeting someone here.
Wow.
It's really fate.
But.
Seeing you this close under the lights,
I discovered that you're more beautiful.
same as Soon Sim.
Good.
Your niece, Ha Soon Shim.
also have grown up prettily.
You're wrong.
Soon Shim wasn't my niece.
So are you meeting Soon Shim just now?
Wait.
I've something to ask you.
That.
I'm in a hurry now.
I have to see Soon Shim.
If that girl is not your niece,
Seeing her will not be easy.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, Please help me.
Right.
Didn't you want to ask me something?
If you help me to do this,
I'll tell you what I know.
Cut.
Ok.
Prepare the items.
-Start to shoot heart's drinking process.
-Yes.
Noona.
Let me help you.
Okay.
Ready, Action.
Cut.
Make a lil brighter.
One more time.
Heart ah, let's do it one last time, ok?
Let me go.
Ready, Action.
What is this?
This isn't Soju.
Who did this?
What exactly are you doing?
What did you gave her to drink?
Wine.
Wine.
-Oh my god.
-After giving her the wine,
Now let's just wait.
If Soon Shim changes, then the wine is certainly weird.
Right.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
What you wanted to ask me?
You, said that you saw what Cui Seung Jae was doing at the exhibit, right?
Regarding Cui Seung Jae, tell me everything without missing a word.
I can't tell you.
If I expose that man, I'm also telling the pain my loved one received.
I can't do it.
It's because of your selfishness, you pulled me here.
now you're saying nice things?
It's like giving you a lever and you think that you can support the earth.
Regarding Miss Lee Tae Ri,
I'm really sorry.
But
That's why.
Tell me quickly.
What did Cui Seung Jae do to the relic in the museum that night?
The cultural relic?
I'm not sure about that.
Didn't you said that you saw all of it?
It's not the relic.
I only saw that ahjussi and Soon Shim together
Soon Shim.
That perverted psycho.
He came here again.
He is the one who gave me the drink.
Catch him.
-Coach.
-How is it?
It's not the wine.
-No?
-Soon Shim didn't change at all.
She kept saying I'm a perverted psycho.
What it is exactly?
Really.
=What to do?
Eun Dong.=
Where to find a 16 year old youth body?
Italy.
Where?
Lee Tae Ri.
It's that woman.
Why all the women I have known, are called by this name?
Who's that woman?
-The woman who hugged me.
-Hugged?
-Coach, It's that woman for sure.
When that woman hugged me, the feel just came.
Giving out some strange lightings.
She smells nice and she's busty too.
Then.
Where is that woman now?
I've just parted with her.
Coach, what to do?
You said that the woman, Lee Tae Ri, hugged you in there before, right?
Yes.
Coach.
Let's break in.
She's the curator.
It's possible that she is inside.
Hey.
You brat.
Bosses don't do night shifts
Oh.
The business card.
She's not answering.
Lee Tae Ri.
CLS group successor.
Grandfather is Lee Jang Soo.
CLS group Chairman Lee Jang Soo?
!
Eun Dong, Do you need to go back?
Of course.
I certainly must take part in the swimming competition and win the gold medal.
You brat.
Hurry up.
The late chairman Lee Jang Soo's residence is at bundang.
You, this brat.
What're you going to do by coming here without a plan?
To find her.
Lee Tae Ri, the woman who made me change into a man.
If I hug her again, I should be able to change back.
This is like finding a needle in a haystack.
Finding it blindly, is just a waste of time.
If it fails this time,
Then it's really the end.
Isn't this my last hope?
I've tried everything already.
This time round will be a success.
I'm going this way
Coach.
Coach.
Come over here.
Coach, Don't have?
Don't have.
What is the time now?
5:30
Eun Dong, Let's split up again and find it one more time.
You go north.
I go south.
If Coach find it first, I will contact you no matter what.
If you find her first, just hug that woman immediately.
Understand?
Yes.
If it's a success, just hurry to the airport immediately.
Before 12 o'clock.
Incheon International airport Block A.
Yes.
Coach.
I will change back and get you a big trophy later.
You need to.
You Brat.
Coach, let's go.
I came to look for Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Where did you come from?
This.
This.
This was given by Miss Lee Tae Ri personally.
Someone is looking for you.
Holding my name card early in the morning.
Who is it?
My leg hurts.
Why is it so far?
When the house is going to show up?
Is this the wrong way?
What's this?
What is it?
Curator, I came to escort you to the event.
This is your first time attending this kind of event.
It would be better if I escort you there.
Choi Seung Jae, are you a farmer?
Why are you stringing up my schedule like the dried persimmons at such an early morning?
It's because of the event that I came to know of your schedule for today.
But.
What is he doing here?
If you leave him unguarded, there will be danger.
I'm not dangerous compared to you.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Can you please do me a favor?
It's really an urgent matter.
Please hug me tightly one more time.
Curator, we'll leave after you're prepared.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, you cannot go.
If you go with him, you'll not know what will happen next.
Just hug me for a moment.
I beg you.
I will give you a chance.
Help me investigate the man for today.
About what this man did to the relic in the museum that night.
If you can give me a satisfied answer,
I'll consider about you later.
Get the car ready and help him change his clothes.
Ah... ah... my hand.
-=Next Week Preview=-
Where do you have confidence in?

Although there's a strange guy.
But until now there is no signs of danger to Director.

Back then, your face is like a charm.
But it is only a pity that is.
You don't laugh frequently now.

Idiot...

Boyfriend?
Choe Sueng Jae oppa is my boyfriend.
Hey.
Ha Sun Sim.
Then Eun Dong.
What is Eun Dong to you?
Ajussi.
Just be honest.
(ajussi - older man, uncle)
You knew that I will be here, so you purposely brought the kid here?
No.
Just to see how Hong Sil perform.
You don't have a friend.
Do you not know why?
Originally you were the only one to accompany me watch Hong Sil perform.
Ever since after (Milan),
I am not yours.
That's why you became Uncle's puppet?
If I were you...
When grandfather opposed our relationship,
You think first how should we escape.
Vice Chairman.
I'm Choe Sueng Jae.
Tae Ri said she will remove the mobile museum.
And will not bother about the museum matter.
Fine.
You've changed a lot.
I didn't change too much, it's just that I don't have anymore excuses to argue my way out.
If it was the original you,
You would have chosen the exact choice.
What?
Ajussi, Eun Dong sent you.
Right?
Eun Dong sent me, why?
In order to hold me in my neck.
Just to let me marry him.
To change the destiny of their desolated family.
Ha Sum Sim.
How can you say such a thing?
Eun Dong's family treat you as their real daughter.
My popularity.
My money.
My brilliant genes.
They are hoping that everything will belong to their family.
And are probably coveting for it now.
Although I don't know how much money Eun Dong gives you.
You better line up.
If you are bought by that brat,
I'll pay you a few times more than him.
Hey.
Ha Sun Sim.
To you, Eun Dong is nothing?
A kid.
He's not even a kid worth mentioning.
And if he's not a child?
If Eun Dong has become a handsome man, and appears before you?
Potatoes covered with fur will not become kiwi fruit.
Drawing a beard on a child will not make him a man.
She's imposibble.
He is nothing to me from the beginning.
Mmm...
What?
Drink with me.
You're really a kid.
You're drinking alcohol to lessen your pain.
Really weak.
Mister Hwang Min Soo.
Being 25 years old, you have the ability to save yourself for being heartbroken.
I'm not 25 years old,okay.
I am not an adult and not Hwang Min Soo.
I'm only a child.
You deny even yourself.
Really a child's temper.
To cure Hwang Min Soo's sadness.
One cup of beer should be enough.
Blowfly's girlfriend.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
I heard you're blowfly's ex-girlfriend.
Who said that?
What is so important about the person who said it?
No matter what, Lee Tae Ri you are blowfly's girlfriend.
What is the reason for it?
Why do you like that fellow?
Just stop it.
Girls like Sun Sim just treat it that her eyes are at the back of her head.
Her judgment is so poor that she actually likes him.
Miss Lee Tae Ri you have a beautiful face.
You're smart.
You're a enviable woman.
Why to admit that fellow is your man?
Grandmother.
What's wrong with you?
You're not taking your medicine for high blood pressure.
You must be careful or else.
Ran away from home.
Because of you,Eun Dong wrote a letter for you and ran away from home.
What?
I'm not eating anymore.
Whether it's hypertension medicine or something, I will not eat it.
Just stop my life.
What's the use of taking so much medicine?
Running from home...
They are using tricks.
Their family sent someone to follow me.
Go get Eun Dong and bring him back.
Look immediately for Eun Dong and bring him back.
What to find?
Grandmother!
Take this advantage to cut the relationship with that family.
You silly girl.
You really don't know why I let you do the engagement?
If I die.
If you have yourself a family.
How can you survive in this dangerous world?
Therefore...
You want me to be with that wimpy kid Eun Dong.
And leave by yourself?
Good.
It's better to die.
It's up to you Grandmother.
This damn girl.
Aigoo.
Don't drink anymore.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Are you crazy?
Drinking such strong alcohol will damage your body.
I'm currently disinfecting.
To admit that the past with that green fly is over.
For saying something useless to green fly tonight.
And,
Hwang Min Soo in South Korea,you're the first one to accompany me to drink in this humiliation.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Tell me honestly.
Where am I lousier than the blowfly?
None at all.
Is that right?
But...
After my first love becomes singer,he ran after to that fellow's side.
Then...
After that rotten girl became famous she abandoned you?
Mmm...
Hwang Min Soo, disinfect.
Since you let that kind of person hurt your heart,
Use this liquor to wash all the pain away.
This liquor.
Is the medicine to cure people's love pain.
You must be patient to recover and heal completely.
You will also find your true love.
Cheers!
First love merely exists for break ups.
Hey.With this appearance you can start all over to Tae Ri.
You know, right?
You just wanted to escape at Milan.
But that Lee Tae Ri.
Having half of Lee Tae Ri's property is good.
Right now.
I'm nothing.
No money background.
Nothing is achieved.
Fail.
Damn it.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Damn it.
Who let you drink so much.
That, Ajumeonni!
(Ajumeonni - older lady, aunt)
Let me use that stroller.
This.This one is too heavy.
Coach.
Aigoo.
Am I some sort of walnut doll?
I can't believe I'm doing this sideline.
Damn it.
Coach.
Aigoo.
Omo.
(Omo - oh my)
So, that's why I am saying,
This woman is Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Let you be flyswatter.
The successor of CLS group.
Coach.
Sleep here.
You are a youth killer.
I did not taught you
To drink with woman and bring them home.
Damn it.
Then it's not like that.
Hey.
Really beautiful.
Really beautiful.
Wow.
But she doesn't even have a wrinkle on her neck.
It is or it is not a ghost
Coach.
Move aside.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Will it kill you if I just took a glance?
My heart does hurt.
Were you dumped?
Today Sun Sim dumped me.
Completely.
What?
Coach.Can I really go back?
My 14 years old life is slowly disappearing.
In the beginning only swimming.Now,even Sun Sim.
The only ones remaining
Stupid brat, isn't there Lee Tae Ri?
If you have this woman.
You will certainly come back.
Don't worry.
This woman.
Is it really worth betting my entire life?
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Please give me some advice.
Give that damn letter to Auntie.
Mother.
I am Eun Dong.
My body changes a lot.
That's why I'd plan to leave home for the meantime.
This brat who left home and didn't even finish the engagement.
Hope you can forgive me.
But I will come back and become a very handsome man.
Believe me and wait for me.
After receiving this letter immediately go to Coach Hwang Min Guk.
Because if something happen to coach
I will feel really bad about it.
Mom.I ask you to support my decision.
I love you.
Mother.
Oh my god!
Mister Hwang Min Soo.
Hwang Min Soo.
What's wrong?
I am Hwang Min Guk.
Eh, Miss Lee Tae Ri, you got out of bed so fast?
Where am I?
This is my house.
This is Hwang Min Soo's, the SEA gold medalist room.
Our Eun Dong.
Wrong.
I am Hwang Min Soo's brother.
Wow, after opening her eyes, she's even more beautiful.
Open your eyes.
Why must you bring me to this place?
What's with walnuts around?
What business do you run exactly?
What do you mean business?
I'm just sleeping.
Don't you know where my house is?
Ah.
I don't have money in my wallet.
Yesterday, you paid the bill when you were drinking.
So, I paid everything.
Wrong.
I used my brother's card to pay.
This exceed its limit.
My card.
I give you this card to use it just in case.
Damn it!
I have here my wallet.
I have 6 cards that has no limits.
I don't like to use woman's money.
Oh my god!
Wine.
Where is this place?
This is at Seoul Metropolitan City, capital of South Korea east city district yes wind tunnel 153 area 91 number.
Come and pick me immediately at yes wind tunnel.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good.
I will come again next time.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Your shoe.
What's wrong?
How should I put this...
I discovered that rice cakes cannot become humans, but humans can become rice cakes!
Yesterday Miss Lee Tae Ri became a rice cake and I carried her back.
I know.
Don't say anymore.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Thank you.
It's because of accompanying me to drink that you became drunk.
Mister Hwang Min Soo.
After we drank, you should disappear the next morning.
Director.
Are you all right?
Hello.
Mr Hwang Min Soo, what are you doing?
Let's go to catch blowfly.
What happened?
Why is the museum empty?
Today the museum is closed without notice.
Who said that?
I remembered that vice chairman said this,
I will not care what happens to the museum.
Furthermore the mobile museum will stop functioning.
Today will be a holiday.
Hwang Min Soo, this person's brother,
He's currently involved in a kidnapping case.
Letting a kidnapper's family member stay by the museum's owner side is a very dangerous thing.
So I want to immediately remove this person.
He is not this kind of person.
Hwang Min Soo's brother eyes are very gentle.
Furthermore he's a family man who peels walnut's skin.
I stayed overnight at Hwang Min Soo's home.
Hwang Min Soo's brother was also there.
Tomorrow we should let the museum be more lively.
No matter what you do, make sure today's sales volume is recovered.
Mister.
Hwang Min Soo.
Yes.
Today I will open the museum freely to Mr Hwang Min Soo.
Go ahead and have fun.
Yes, Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Gim Eun Dong and Ha Sun Sim are engaged.
Ha Sun Sim, I will forget you from now on.
Starting right now there will not be a 14 years old Gim Eun Dong who will think of you.
I will use this future 3 weeks to protect Miss Lee Tae Ri with my very best.
I will definitely return.
After I return back, I will start over.
Forget a girl like you.
And become the best guy ever.
But before that I'm Hwang Min Soo,
Miss Lee Tae Ri's flyswatter.
25 years old, Hwang Min Soo.
Hwang Min Soo, Hwang Min Soo.
Sleeping?
Actually slept at that guy's place.
It's not like that.
Why?
...
Exactly why?
I will immediately go investigate why.
I'm all right.
I said, I'm all right.
Today's evening?
Yes.
I understand.
Hong Sil.
Mmm...
Were you scared?
Seung Jae Oppa is currently my boyfriend.
Why didn't you tell me,
That Miss Lee Tae Ri is your friend?
Fine, I won't ask anything about your past,
What's Seung Jae Oppa and Miss Lee Tae Ri's relationship?
Tell me everything you know.
I don't know, I don't know anything!
Is that so, then I think I will retire from acting.
As the leader of Apple's Head
You changed your age by 7 years to fool the fans,
I can't bear to watch it any longer.
I will bear responsibility for and quit the show business.
You can't, Sun Sim, you can't.
Then tell me.
You clearly know that you can't stop me.
Heart,
Is the number one modelling idol in the Republic of Korea.
She's also the the number one idol who is most sought after by the youths.
For 3 years she is in charge of CLS group image and CLS cars' industry foremost model.
After we let Heart became the model.
CLS group became likeable amongst the young generation.
CLS car sales also increased by 80%.
Truly envious.
If she becomes a spokesperson for our museum.
It will most probably be a big highlight.
Unless Heart herself agrees, she won't receive any other shows.
Blowfly will definitely interfere.
The flyswatter is jilted by the stupid bitch and heartbroken.
If I say anything she won't accept.
Just give it a try.
I want to give this cute squirrel, such delicious chestnut.
Then I can let her come to my museum and play.
Does Miss Lee Tae Ri have time today?
Time?
Please give me a special lesson.
Choe Seung Jae, under Korean's age system he's 30 years old.
Choe Sueng Jae. 30 years old.
Birthplace is Seoul.
When he was 17 years old, his parents divorced.
Immigrated and went to Italy's Milano
Ah, Mung bean fly is also from Italy?
It's not Miss Lee Tae Ri, I meant he's a student studying in italy.
Height 182CM, Body weight at 7OKG /- 1 KG.
Just a Mung Bean fly, and he's so heavy.
How does he fly around.
Milano's university, and he specializes in architecture.
Recruiting people is his strength.
Physically strong and his pride is also strong as well.
He definitely will not play games that he will lose in.
During school, he's also a fencer member.
Eh, I said he's sharp like a sword will be sort of rude.
Sharp enough to pierce through leather shoes.
Enough with the stupid comments.
You don't want to listen anymore?
It's not that, please teach me.
If I want to be a professional flyswatter,
I need to learn more about Mung Bean Fly's data.
His mother is managing a travel agency.
So he's very familiar with Italy's geography.
Italian language, Italian cuisine,
Even controlling the Italian's affairs, everything is at a professional level.
Wow, he completely knows everything about Italy.
He's also brave and honest.
He has never run from anything without excuse.
Optimistic till the point of making other people angry.
And he really likes to have good food and the hot passionate love of Italian's living.
Aigoo.
Stop, stop, stop.
You are only telling me about his good points.
How am I going to swat him down?
Tell me about the bad points of Mung Bean Fly, all his weaknesses, you should tell me.
Don't tell me you don't know anything about countering someone.
Aigoo.
You really have no sense.
Don't have sense?
!
Kiwi fruits, he's allergic to kiwi fruits.
Kiwi fruits, very good.
Crapping in the morning.
If he's doesn't go to the toilet in the morning, he will feel uncomfortable throughout the day.
Eh, crapping in the morning?
His hairstyle, if his hairstyle is ruined he will lose his cool.
Ah that's good, one can use that.
And?
Surprise date.
I thought the matter last time made you angry.
I'm angry.
Tell me honestly.
Who exactly is Hwang Min Soo?
Is it me or is it Lee Tae Ri.
What?
The reason you're curious about Hwang Min Soo.
Isn't it because that guy is beside Lee Tae Ri?
And that's why you're jealous?
Don't be arrogant.
I heart that Hong Sil is Lee Tae Ri's friend.
Oppa actually let someone follow Lee Tae Ri.
I heard everything to Hong Sil,that you investigated her.
if there are any guys who approach Lee Tae Ri.
Don't make use of Hong Sil.
She doesn't know anything.
Hwang Min Soo is someone I sent.
Because I don't like Oppa at Lee Tae Ri's side.
So I did it to seperate you two.
Ha Sun Sim.
I still remember, that I met you for the first time when you were 18.
You actually pretended to be jealous in front of my face.
Immediately remove that guy.
Miss Heart.
I'm really grateful that you became our museum's spokesperson.
I should be the one saying thank you.
Your conditions are great,
I will of course accept it.
With Miss Heart's participation,
Our museum will become younger.
Not only will the past become relatable,
You will also bring the future's technology to satisfy the young generation.
You can experience here the feeling of no gravity.
looks like as if it's a entertainment facility.
Miss Heart, just try it.
Alright, I will try it.
The feelings of being lonely from not being able to walk and stop by myself,
Without feeling any weight at all to feel the universe.
That's the feeling,
Yes, that's the feeling when you were dumped for the first time.
It feels very much like this gravity-less place.
This is the facility to experience typhoons.
That's enough, chairman.
If you use this method to promote the museum,
The chairman will be in trouble.
Then what method will be fine.
Mr Choe, how you try it, go ahead.
Yes, manager Choe, experience it with me.
Manager Choe.
I will let you have a chance to experience a typhoon with the best star.
Unable to to open one's eyes, unable to avoid the rain.
And the helpless feeling of being unable to stop the wind.
The natural power of a hurricane.
Just like how it felt when you were dumped by your first love.
Without any umbrella and thrown into the midst of a typhoon.
Thank you, Miss Heart.
Because of your strong sales pitch today,
Our museum will attract more people.
Vice Chairman!
Ajussi,
How long more are you going to use the engagement and threaten me?
Until today.
You hurt Eun Dong, and you slighted his family members.
But since you helped Miss Lee Tae Ri today, everything is written off.
I will never speak about the engagement again.
You really know how to line up.
You want to abandon Eun Dong,
And make money off Lee Tae Ri right?
Ajussi, is the matter about Eun Dong leaving home fake?
Did his family lie to the media just so they can hold me down?
Sun Sim.
Don't be mistaken,
Eun Dong will never like you again from now onwards.
Whether it's leaving home, returning home, or becoming a monk.
He will absolutely not like you.
So, go ahead and fall in love with Mung Bean Fly.
Ah.
Do you know mung bean fly?
If he sees new food on the table he won't even bother returning.
How can there be such a damn beggar who likes to polish boots?
!
One two.
One two.
You.
Why didn't you try your best to stop?
You really think I allowed you to return to Tae Ri's side, just so you can do this kind of scandal?
Sorry.
Vice Chairman.
Fine.
You can stop.
From now onwards I will stop Tae Ri.
Vice Chairman, please trust me one more time.
I will perform well this time.
Choe Sueng Jae.Do it well.
Before my son come back from Australia.
Learning this darn swimming is already making me busy.
PLEASE.Okay?
Miss Tae Ri.
Your gift.
Use it.
Using this will let Miss Lee Tae Ri more comfortable.
This is Italy's bath tower.
Are you jerking me?
I'm not one who plays when I'm at work.
Didn't you help me take revenge on Sun Sim?
Revenging on your first love.
That is really only because I wanted to make the Museum's image bigger.
Aigoo.
No.
Gift can't be back.
Furthermore, this is my --
My brother sewed this personally.
Vice Chairman invites you to attend the party.
Do I really have to go?
Of course.
Vice Chairman is congratulating you for taking the position of Director's museum.
how can the main character be missing?
You must see and speak to Vice Chairman and show him your strength.
Tell that you must protect the museum.
This is the banquet's list.
Mister Hwang Min Soo.
Yes.
Prepare to start the banquet.
I LOVE Italy.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
I think of you when I sew this Italian bath towel.
Teacher.How is it?
What's that?
Mung bean fly list.
There will be a party.
Everything that is written on the banquet's list, after you remember all of them, I will make confirm it.
Confirm who is Miss Lee Tae Ri's Mung Bean Fly.
Really...
Coach.
Coach, are you there?
Coach, coach.
Aigoo.Hello Teacher.
That...
Teacher.
We are really sorry.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
Instructor.
We're really so sorry.
Really sorry.
If my wife cooked her soup earlier,
We won't suspect coach.
We're very sorry.
We didn't know that Eun Dong left home.
Sorry, coach.
Coach, we don't have any face to see you.
We didn't know that you went through so much pain for our son.
I...
I'll help you clean your room.
No need no need, Auntie, no need.
I can't.
Aigoo.Teacher,this should be wash.
If you are at ease that will be good enough, Auntie.
Aigoo.
Don't be like this.
Coach, just drink this and sleep well.
I will be at your side to serve you until you fall asleep.
Ah...
When I see you I feel that my blood pressure is rising.
Blood pressure?
Yes.
I beg you to go out please.
Aigoo.
Just because of us.
Because of us.
Quickly make a call, my dear.
I don't have a phone.
You didn't let me buy a handphone.
Let's quickly go.
Coach.
Hurry up and leave.
Hurry.
Coach, Y
Let's go,see you again.
Did they leave?
Did you leave?
What?
Running away from home?
Yeah, ran away from home.
Much better than kidnapping, right?
You can't, Tae Ri.
Oh my god!
3 weeks ago, he was okay.
Hong Sil, re-zip this.
1, 2, 3.
I can't.
I seem to have became fatter.
Do you want to change to something else Tae Ri?
This is also pretty, this too.
Wear this.
No, I want to wear this.
Tomorrow's banquet, I'm the protagonist.
Tae Ri, will Seung Jae Oppa be there at the banquet?
What is it?
That Seung Jae Oppa
Ah.
It came up.
I will prove to them,
That I have the capability to protect the museum.
Damn it, Gim Eun Dong that brat,
Even told him that I have feet calluses to him.
The previous year when you learned crazily how to dance, and you got calluses.
You always asked me to buy medicine for it,
This is something that I only know.
The future Eun Dong, will not like you anymore.
Don't tell me, Hwang Min Soo,
You came.
Mister Hwang Min Soo, isn't your attire too exaggerated?
Wearing this feels like Hwang Min Soo, you are the protagonist.
The more gorgeous the flyswatter dresses, the better he can swat the Mung Bean fly.
Vice chairman, I'm here.
Say hello.
Hello Uncle.
Aigoo.
I didn't call out to you.
You dare to show your face here.
Furthermore, a day like today,
What the hell are you wearing?
I said there's a memorial service today for Chairman Lee.
She said she really wants to come.
A memorial service?
Lee Tae Ri says she wants to personally meet with the vice chairman.
So I brought her here.
Eh this is her grandfather's memorial.
Of course, you come to pay respects.
Let's go.
Manager Choe, there's no seat for Miss Lee Tae Ri.
I said there's no seat for Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Then use your own method to make one.
Isn't that your specialty?
Causing trouble and mayhem.
Go play.
Down below is the CLS group founder.
Grieving for our group's Chairman Lee Jang Su.
Grandpa,
What are you doing?
Don't tell me you want to stand?
That Mung Bean Fly is waiting for us to cause trouble.
Hurry up!
First of all let's introduce the main protagonist for this memorial.

On Lee Dong Sik work, at Seoul year 1996 his wife died on that day.
At the knee is the only daughter Miss Lee Tae Ri.
In this slide here, this is the last picture of Miss Lee Tae Ri's parents who got into an accident.
The most regretful thing about this, is this story happened when her parents when to receive Tae Ri.
And that day.
It was on Lee Tae Ri's birthday.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
I'll be right back.
You're too much.
Damn it, you're only a Mung Bean Fly.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, let's go.
Let's do a real party.
-=Next Episode Preview=-
He is kidnapping.
Kidnap.
Kidnap.
22 days of contract paper.
I will surely grab that mung fly bastard.
I really like to take care of your heart,
But I like Lee Tae Ri.
I want to date with Hwang Min Soo.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, are you crazy?
Lend me the flyswatter.
I need to use it.
It's gone.
Couldn't find it anymore.
Lee Tae Ri.
Yes.
This the Lee Tae Ri.
I almost went crazy because of that woman.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Don't cry.
I will protect you.
Next, President Lee's eldest son.
On Lee Dong Wu's work.
On Lee Dong Wu's work, at Seoul year 1996 his wife died on that day.
Under the knee is the only daughter Lee Tae Ri.
This picture shows the accident that Lee Tae Ri's mother and father were involved.
Their final moments were captured here.
Unfortunately,
The accident occurred when her father and mother were picking her up from school.
And today is Miss Lee Tae Ri's birthday.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
I'll be right back.
You're too much.
Damn it, you're just a mung bean fly.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, let's go.
Let's go to a real party.
=Episode 5=
Lee Tae Ri, want to first disinfect it first?
What should we use to disinfect?
Soju?
Beer or Wine?
Let's go to practice.
What?
Disinfecting isn't enough to cheer me up today.
Cleansing can do.
Damn it.
Damn it.
But who is that fellow?
I will immediately finish him.
If Tae Ri were to be snatched away by him.
The time you spent on my side would be wasted.
There will be no such thing.
It's really attractive.
Our Seung Jae.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, didn't you say you want to practice?
This is where I will practice.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, don't cry.
I will protect you.
I will definitely protect you.
He's not there?
Gim Eun Dong?
Eun Dong Gim?
No?
No?
He really hasn't gone to Australia.
That guy wouldn't simply give up the swimming competition and ran away from home.
Then...
Don't tell me he has been kidnapped in Australia?
Hwang Min Soo!
You're always jumping, that's why your toe hurts.
You have a high standard of practice.
Lee cheonggukjang.
I mean cheonggukjang.
I use foot to cook cheonggukjang Lee Tae Ri.
Lee cheonggukjang.
Ah, just joking.
It's not smelly.
The taste of tears and the smell of sweat are very precious to humans, is what my mother says.
That.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Do you miss your mother and father?
I can only endure it.
Because I'm an adult.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Before I go back, I'll properly be your flyswatter.
Go back?
The 22 day contract.
Didn't we agree to be together for 22 days until the contract ends?
Thank you, for today.
No.
I was a very bad flyswatter today.
If I knew earlier that mung bean fly will do something like that,
I wouldn't had let you to go inside.
I see.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
You were great today.
Today, you were brave not to cry in front of mung bean fly.
And left with your head held up high.
Your skirt is also very pretty.
Ah.
The way of handling your cleansing is the best.
But having me as your partner must have been a bit embarrassing.
Mister Hwang Min Soo.
Today you don't have to be ashamed.
Wife.
You're so early to work with that cabbage.
I don't want our Eun Dong to be kicked out of the swimming team.
You just obediently work.
Mmm...
I want to give coach some kimchi.
I also want to give other members some kimchi.
During these circumstances it would be great, if we had some money in our hands.
How can kimchi be used as a bribe?
The poorer a person is, the more talented they are.
The reason why we are like this, is because your hands are heaven's gift.
So,do you want to try this God's gift?
Want to try?
Want to try?
Try it.
You what is this shit?
I'm already dead tired.
Ajumma.
(Ajumma-older lady,aunt)
Damn it, this girl.
Where do you think you are?
How dare you come here?
Immediately get lost!
Get lost!
That's really...
Is this really Eun Dong's letter?
Yes.
What do you plan to do?
All because you escaped and ruined the engagement ceremony,
Eun Dong ran away from home.
My son.
Where are you planning to find my son?
Aigoo, Sun Sim.Leave quickly.
You won't be able to bring back Eun Dong acting this way.
Let go, let go.
Hey!
This rotten girl, this rotten girl.
Your elders had not finished talking to you yet and you leave abruptly.
Damn it, you really deserve to die rotten girl.
What's going on?
Hwang Min Soo.
That fellow ruined the chairman's memorial service.
That's why I'm taking this position.
Not bad as an excuse.
This isn't an excuse.
Your image has been greatly damaged because of that fellow.
The Stockholders were planning to have a meeting to dismiss you as the Chairman.
Therefore...
Let Hwang Min Soo leave, after that pass me the museum's management,
Then I will be in charge of.
Then, let me leave.
Lee Tae Ri.
Don't tell me because of one memorial service you will just give up?
This courage.
That's why you last time must oppose with Vice Chairman?
Yesterday's party.
Isn't it to test my courage?
Too bad.
That's why I want to resign.
It is not because of Uncle, but because I don't want to see you.
Memorial service.
Is open for you.
If I don't do this.
Vice Chairman will handle you personally.
It looks that you will be bullied by him.
It might be good If I play the bad guy here.
I want to date with Hwang Min Soo.
Eat, drink and love.
Just like italian people.
Italian method.
Lee Tae Ri's style.
Hwang Min Soo.
Say it quickly, I'm late.
Did your Uncle kidnapped Eun Dong?
What are you saying?
Didn't you said that Eun Dong will not like you in the future?
How come you know this thing?
How can you know the mood of someone who ran away from home?
Hey.
That's because...
This kidnapper.
Here, there's a kidnapper!
Kidnapper!
Kidnapper!
Hey, Ha Sun Sim.
This is my work.
Hwang Min Guk.
High School swimming teacher Hwang Min Guk.
You know him,right?
He's my older brother.
Eun Dong's love consultant and his idol.
Really?
Yes.
Rotten girl.
Eun Dong confided to my brother before he ran away from home.
Your two-timed and your scandal.
You betray him on the engagement ceremony and kissing on another man.
Eun Dong said he saw it.
I'm not a kidnapper.
Your the monster kidnapper.

Mister Hwang Min Soo.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Let's go to a date.
Hey.
Mung bean fly.
You miss my lips?
Do you want me to kiss you again?
Miss Lee Tae Ri, are you crazy?
How can you give up the museum?
Because I don't like.
Work fight makes me get tired.
Then the sun clock?
Can you relax while that mung bean fly get that Sun clock?
Sun clock will not change my life.
Lee Tae Ri.
It's just like that, Lee Tae Ri.
Starting today I'm not a heiress and Director.
I want to change my life and become a natural person named Lee Tae Ri.
In the end still defeated by that fellow.
Lee Tae Ri.
Do you know what your condition are?
No ambition plus no fighting spirit.
Your just like the Ajumma's in the sauna who always throw towels.
Aigoo.
Where is it again?
Hwang Min Soo, I'm so happy today.
Go take a bath now.
I think I have a lot of ashes to be removed.
I have a lot to be eliminated and to be worried about.
If this type of strategy
It will not be tiresome even it takes a year.
Strategy?
You thought Choe Seung Jae will let me off?
Five detectives following me, and pretending as if nothing happened, that's how fierce he is.
Then, you intentionally deceive mung bean fly?
Right.
First of all I want him to think that I will not bother the musuem completely.
Like this I can proceed to the next step.
Aigoo.
It's nice if you tell me earlier, you scared me to death.
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
What's your next move?
Anything that Hwang Min Soo wants.
So.
Lie down first.
Hyeong!
How come your late?
Damn it.From the gate,it tooks me 30 minutes to reach the door.
Oh my god.
Aigoo, Miss Lee Tae Ri.
It's really my honor for inviting me here in your house.
Ok then,The real party starts now.
Choe Seung Jae.
You actually want to dumped me.
I, am the good garlic.
World most hot sour meat.
Wait and see.
I will let you taste my hotness.
Hey.Heart. What's going on?
I don't know, I'm eating meat.
You were resigned?
Choe Seung Jae's groups get all of your advertisements and model list
Everything to be cancel.
What?
Payments for the breach of contract is on the company's account.
And prepared a lawyer.
And there are also long contract will be ended.
If this time was resigned.
It will be very difficult to take an advertisement in the future.
Your image will suddenly plummeted.

What is wrong with you?
Your stomach?
Does it hurt?
Hey.
Hey.
Talk.
Both of these guys seems not related.
Exactly the same.

Resting at home.
Together with Hwang Min Soo and his brother.
It seems that she's completely over about the museum.
Don't let down your guard.
Pay attention on every action of Tae Ri.
Yes.
And Hwang Min Guk is Vice Chairman's only son swimming coach.
What?
Wow.
Very pretty.
Like a pajamas model.
But,wearing is this for?
Of course, to play a game.
For example steal the heart game or anything.

Hwang Min Soo.
Don't tell me you don't know like this fun game?
Mister Min Guk, you don't know what is this?
Aigoo.
Of course,I know it already.
Legendary Monopoly game.
A tragic game where in order to construct house you can't give sentiment thought to your parents.
3 years difference can't be underestimated.
Generation gap is too big.
I also know what is this.
But this is quite an old game.
This was my birthday gift when I'm 12 years old.
Miss Lee Tae Ri, that's not what I meant.
I used this game from Grandfather to learn business.
Start now.
Wow.When you looked at this it's an antique.

Rotten brat.
How can you kiss 3 times in the same place?
Wow.

Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Where is this?
To me,it's as precious as the museum.
Don't tell me it's here, Miss Lee Tae Ri.
How did your grandfather gave you so many things?
He live a boring life in order to achieved this.
In the future, it will become interesting.

The plan is not to give you the position.
So hurry to take the position of Director.
After that start to eliminate the museum's plan.
Dae-dong museum.
Cheers to Director Choe Seung Jae.
Choe Seung Jae wants to be a Director?
Yes.
To be a museum's curator and saying the he must resign you.

Uncle was too annoying.
Pretends a charming appearance in front of us.
How come he can stab people at the back?
Looks like both of them have personal matter that haven't solved yet.
Personal matters?
Hey.Heart.You.
This is Apple's South korea head Manager.

Much faster than we expected.
Tae Ri.

Why Seung Jae Oppa becomes the Director?
(Oppa- older brother,boyfriend)
Sun Sim?
She's at the hospita, she have stomach spasm.
Here?
1,10 hundred, 10 million,100 thousand, 10 million.
Billion.
Hwang Min Guk, you can't be like this.
I will just sit in it for a moment then I'll send it back.
Money money what money?
Round like a gold coin money.

Hyeong?
Why must be like this?
Why in a person's life?
Have to work this hard.
Rotten brat.
You scared me to death.
Lee Tae Ri.
I'm going crazy because of that woman.
What?
I can't help her.
This drives me crazy.
I can't find a thing.
I can't catch mung bean fly.
Mung bean fly, do you mean Mister Choe Seung Jae?
What bullshit Mister?
Damn it.
Coach, I must catch that mung bean fly.
Before I catch him.
I must be always Hwang Min Soo.
So you'll temporarily let go of 14 years old Eun Dong's life?
For example I can temporarily not be Eun Dong's swimming coach.
I said, I'm Hwang Min Soo.
What is it?
You have to go to museum.
Isn't it that Seung Jae Oppa is the Director?
Oppa will prevent to work as Image Spokesperson.
Image Spokesperson.
You're good to make him agree with you.
I, Lee Tae Ri will help Heart until she becomes Choe Seung Jae's man.
Choe Seung Jae is not yet your man.
That's why our contract is still effective.
I'll go to the museum to help you.
What relationship when Seung Jae oppa become my man?
When Choe Seung Jae is completely destroy.
He will give up on me and then look for you.
Then, I have condition.
What condition?
Let me borrow your flyswatter.
Why Hwang Min Soo?
To work as my boyfriend.
Apple's Heart with her boyfriend dating in the museum.
This will not have a big effect in the public.
Why?
Must use Hwang Min Soo?
Because I'm feeling aggrieved.
Seung Jae Oppa is always looking for Eonni.
(Eonni - older sister) also made my self-esteem damage.
When Hwang Min Soo becomes my boyfriend.
I also have to get in between Eonni and Choe oppa.
If it's the reason,
I won't accept this condition.
Because Hwang Min Soo will reject it.
You can force him to do it.
This is just to save the museum.
and you don't have a feelings for him.
don't you have reason to object it,right?
Eonni.
Goodnight.
Hwang Min Soo!
Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Get up.We should go to the museum.
Miss Lee Tae Ri,are you crazy?
Why I have to be Sum Sim's boyfriend?
This is for the museum.
This is an extension for the 22 days contract.
You said it before.
22 days contract.
As long as I want to continue to delay it.
I also changed some contract conditions
I, Hwang Min Soo becomes Image Spokesperson, Ha Sun Sim's boyfirend for one day.
Because It concerns the museum.
I will do my best for Lee Tae Ri's sake.
If I don't have the confidence and afraid that I might waver to Ha Sun Sim.
I can terminate the contract immediately.
Too complicated?
No.
Very simple and very good.
I will work well as Ha Sun Sim's boyfriend.
Just for Miss Lee Tae Ri.
Then, you should sign.
Hong Sil.
One hour day of biking.
Can change me like you.
Mmm...
This is my secret to look young.
Sweating it out on the bicycle machine will lessen the pimples.
Hong Sil.
Mmm...
Do I look old?
No.
But having the title of museum's director.
Looks like your older.
Is that right?
That's why It's said to be that I'm a heiress?
You will not resign in the museum because of this reason?
Because you don't want to let people think you're older.
Just temporarily resting.
But Hong Sil, what cosmetic do you use?
I use trace cosmetic, I'm the spokesperson of that brand.
Get me a set of that cosmetics.
Tae Ri, you have a boyfriend?
You a bit strange today.
I want to eliminate 3 pimples and then go back.
Everyone, I'm in love.
This man who is wearing his helmet is my boyfriend.
My boyfriend's face will be revealed after the completion of Sun Clock's maintenance.
In this public place.
Before the return of Sun Clock's true colors.
Heart will announce to the public.
My helmet man's true face.
Please look forward to it.
Ha Sun Sim.

Sun Sim, adult world is not simple as you thinks.
I'm doing this for a reason.
It's really since a while.
After I become star.
I never seen once the star in the sky properly.
You must take a good rest occasionally.
Becoming a star is good, But you're still Sun Sim.
Who likes star candy, who will stay all night just to see the meteor shower.
A silly village litte girl Ha Sun Sim.
Uncle.
You really don't know where Eun Dong is?

He can't come back.
That's why I want to let him back to hand it over to Curator Paolo.
You can't do any action, once he takes the side of someone like me.

How come I never see that guy, Seung Jae?
He will not come in the museum in the future.
He perfectly deal with Choe Seung Jae.
I heard you got kicked out of the museum?
It looks like you're reserving the seat for Tae Ri?
In order to let Tae Ri control the museum your objective is to hide the truth from me,right?
No, only when Tae Ri's little brother worked under Vice Chairman.
What do you plan to do?
Curator Paolo had came back and that girl will have the courage to overthrow me.
First, we must withdraw from the museum and then--
Didn't I said before?
Your position no longer exists in the company.
You want to get Tae Ri's words?
just grab the Curator's position and continue when you're Director.
Or just like a beggar begging for Tae Ri's heart to return at your side.
What is it?
It is the Sun Clock's principle.
It has all the important principles and manufacturing process.
Grandpa, by reading this book
Can we know who sabotage the Sun Clock?
This is not cause by man.
Then?
You should know that the Sun Clock represents top-notched science derived from the basic of natural phenomenon.
but it also sense as mysterious talisman.
When the Sun Clock changed that time there are probably other changes too.
Changes?
Perhaps...
Quit!
You put apple's name in shame!
You made me quit!
Director, are you crazy?
I am Heart.
What bullshit Heart?
!
Do you know what female star I am sick the most?
That is to live together.
To live together.
In this news it writes that you're cohabitating with Choe Seung Jae.
Does make it sense that Choe Seung Jae is my boyfriend?
reporters always write anything.
Manager, how can you waver?
Helmet male, it is only to promote the museum activities.
you should immediately dis-confirm the news.
Hurry!
Na Hong Sil, starting today you're the leader.

-=Episode 7.=-
Ms. Lee Tae Ri
I want to confess something to you.
Confess?
Mmm...
I feel that the real mistake should not be concealed.
Because Ms. Lee Tae Ri is my only friend after I became adult
Ms. Lee Tae Ri...
I'm actually a child.
A kid who has just been living for mere days in the adult world.
I wanted to protect you, but I don't have the confidence and I'm always crying like this.
I feel that I'm useless, that's why I'm depressed.
I'm also a child.
Compared to what I have now, there are things that I don't know not unlike you.
Although I look very confident and arrogant like someone who has everything they want in life, my life is also tiring.
But at least your life is real.
I am adopted.
The child that they tried so hard to have.
I heard it on my 14th birthday from my uncle that time I'm very afraid and weak.
that's why I don't even dare to blow the candle on my cake.
Hwang Min Su, you said it before.
The happiest time of your life is being fourteen years old.
You still remember that?
Of course.
Because of what you said I became curious about you.
When you said that your happiest moment is being 14 years old.
What exactly kind of person were you at that time?
that you want to return back.
Ms. Lee Tae Ri, I'm sorry.
I'm really very sorry.
Don't say that.
The most saddest 14 year old time for me and the most happiest 14 year old time for you.
We will become very good friends.
That's why don't waver and stay by my side.
Then, I will spend the night here.
Here?
I'll go wash a moment.
A man's tears are only shed once in a lifetime.
You remember me.
You are, Hwang Min Su.
25 years old Hwang Min Su.
You must protect that woman.
Oh my god!
Sleep here?
This is not right Lee Tae Ri.
Kick him out immediately.
Ms. Lee Tae Ri,
Lie down.
No, No need.

With this bright light, it's no wonder the sheep wants to come out and play with you.
Today, I'll let you to have a good sleep.
Hand.
Mother said that when you can't sleep it's because you miss someone's warmth.
Quickly.
My hand is very warm.
If you hold in it you'll sleep soon.
It's really warm.
Are you comfortable there?
Mmm...
Yes.
Even if I sleep on cactus bed tonight, I'll feel very comfortable because I'm able to protect you.
Hwang Min Su.
Why do you want to protect me?
Because you're a good person.
Today, I feel I can sleep early.
It seems that my hand is like a medicine to you.
When you leave in Milan,
I thought I couldn't see you again.
I'm sorry for seeing you late.
You don't have to say sorry, I just wake so early.
Teacher.
Please return to Milan.
Are you doing this just to leave Lee Tae Ri?
How can you stand with Dong Seok's side?
The only way to reconcile with Tae Ri is to gain power from Vice Chairman.
You'll regret it.
standing at Dong Sik's side, in the end you'll be hurt.
I should bear this hurt and regret.
Please leave.
I won't go back.
I have to help Tae Ri.
It is the last promise I made with the late president.
Then, today will be the last time to see me as your student.

I'm very suspicious of his past.
No need for you to care regardless of what his past is.
He's now my people.
Tae Ri.
Don't believe too much in him.
Didn't I said before?
That guy is possibly sent by Vice Chairman for you to be a spy.
Hwang Min Soo is not like you.
You used me in order to succeed.
He's absolutely not that kind of person.
Think about it properly.
For instance, the timing he appears in your life is really great.
Hwang Min Soo, I'm disappointed last night I'm holding it as a medicine hand and now turned out to be a bag of waste paper.

It looks like you change a lot, Uncle.
This money tried to push away the people around me.
How dare you--
Using money to buy people.
But having Seung Jae is enough.
I...absolutely will not let Hwang Min Soo lose to you.
With what you said, do you have the confidence?
Of course.
I'm very confident.
Director Hwang, where are you?
I heard what my brother said.
I'm sorry and thank you.
That's the betrayal of your brother you're teling me
I didn't expect such a thing.
For not telling you earlier, I'm sorry.
Money problems?
Perhaps, is it related to Sun Sim?
What?
Yesterday, your behavior towards Sun Sim.
I find it very strange.
I'm only a Manager.
I want to pay all the debt as soon as possible and stay at Ms. Lee Tae Ri's side.
Director Hwang, our friendship is strong enough.
We're certainly not shaken just because of money.
Just it.
This is your car.
What?
Ms. Lee Tae Ri, you're so rich you bought me clothes, and also buying me a car.
How can you use a money to buy man's self-respect?
You don't want to do this kind of drama in the public in front of me.
This just to strengthen our friendship.
Do you worship money too much?
or you don't want to make friends with a guy without a car?
First principle of friendship is to be nimble.
Before a misunderstanding between each other, needs a strength that can solve the misunderstanding quickly.
But Ms. Lee Tae Ri, I feel that--
And also...
Second principles of friendship is don't refuse friend's sincerity.
Don't feel burdened by the gift
It's enough that you accept my heart's intention.
Aigoo.
Then teach me how to drive.
Hwang Min Soo, don't you have a driver's license?
I have never driven a car before.
Not once.
Open.
Step a little bit again.
Right.
Ms. Lee Tae Ri, I feel that I become real adult.
Careful.
Hold on one point.
It's fun.
Wow!
Our Seung Jae seems to have a worthy brains.
Just like what you said, Tae Ri will look for me with the money.
telling me that Hwang Min Soo is not allowed to used.
Tae Ri will surely do that.
She got no one on her side to believe.
that's why even that kind of person she will protect it.
It seems that Tae Ri treasures that guy.
When talking about that guy she looked very serious.
Tae Ri's expression is always serious.
What?
Yes.
It will immediately restore to it's original state.
Then, will it really be able to repair it?
The axis moves and it represents that there's a force of nature in it.
As long as no one intervened sooner or later it will return.
It will return?
Because the Sun Clock developed and caused a change everything will be restored.
Thank you teacher.
This is all thanks to your good fortune.
I'm going to the washroom.
Is your feelings for Seung Jae is sorted?
Almost.
Thanks to him, it makes me feel rest.
Returning to its original appearance?
No it's not.
Really?
Even if the Sun Clock is restored.
As long as I'm not in front of the Sun Clock and doesn't hug her then I will not change back.
Oh.How come my beard never come out?
My muscles seems changing.
If the Sun Clock suddenly restored
I can't absolutely change to 14 years old.
Oppa, something happened?
I have something to say.
What is the matter?
Hong Sil.
About me and Tae Ri's brake up you should know that you're also responsible.
Oppa, that time I really put my effort to prevent this.
Hwang Min Soo.
You also know that fellow?
Curator.
Does the Sun Clock need to be repair this time?
What do you mean by that?
I suddenly feel uneasy.
When the Sun Clock suddenly restored
I'm afraid that everything will change.
Director Hwang, don't worry.
Everything will not change.
It will be always like this.
Of course.
With me around, you can't be kicked out in the museum.
Smile.
Let's get off work.
Eating together on the road while cultivating our friendship.
This, what is it?
Grandfather's gift.
He said that It can let me meet the real marriage predestined by this fate charm.
Charm?
He said fate have a foot.
Even if he's far away.
But if it's destined by fate.
No matter what he will return to her side.
It seems I have seen this somewhere.
This thing is designed based on the Sun Clock, that's why it's familiar.
It's originally with a sun and a two moon.
But It has only one moon now.
Curator, I'll leave first.
Our sons smell are now gone.
Gim Eun Dong, where exactly are you?
Mother.
Hyeong ask me to get something (Hyeong
- Older brother.)
the thing that Eun Dong have.
Aigoo.
What's that thing?
Mother.
I'm sorry, can you help me to sew this?
Yes.
Ah.
Yes, give it to me.
Your shoulder, I need to confirm it.
For you.
Omona.
This shirt button also need to be resew.
No need to.
See this button if you just let it hang like that it will fall.
No.
Hurry take if off, I'll help you to sew it.
It's alright.
Hurry take it off.
Hurry take if off, I'll help you to sew it.
It's really alright.
Aigoo, take it off.
Honey, help me to scratch my back.
Father!
Omo!
(Omo
- Oh my)
You, this crazy kid undressing in front of me!
Father.
No, it's not like that.
Why I am you father?
Aren't you pointing out?
Are you emphasizing in front of my wife that you're young, is that so?
I won't let you off.
You can't!
Honey!
You come here!
Rotten brat!
You leave quickly.
Honey!
The real marriage is predestined by fate.
Hey!
Mung bean fly, why are you here?
Damn it!
What are you doing?
How can you let Tae Ri confront Vice Chairman?
What?
Tae Ri took the money and went to Vice Chairman to cause trouble because of you.
Do you know why I'm making Tae Ri suffer?
it's to prevent her to fight directly with Vice Chairman.
I don't want to see him to trample everything to hurt Tae Ri.
Just don't look,it should be stop no matter what the solutions are.
Then first stop the Sun Clock.
If you want to protect Tae Ri.
Stop the restoration of the Sun Clock.
You...
You want me to stop the restoration of the Sun Clock?
You and Tae Ri if you had meet like this or fate that brings you together
You should at least do something to her.
Vice Chairman said that if you cause trouble, he will no bother Tae Ri.
Hong Sil.
Choe Seung Jae words is nothing but a nail.
The things you said just to hurt me,why are you taking it seriously?
When was the first time you met Hwang Min Soo?
The first time I see him?
Tae Ri, this is all planned.
Hwang Min Soo is Uncle's spy that was sent to you just to destroy the Sun Clock.
I say, Isn't it said by Choe Seung Jae?
Choe Seung Jae want to seperate me to Hwang Min Soo.
and also force his brother to take the money.
He said that he's waiting for opportunities.
waiting for you to publish the Sun Clock's restoration and ruin the Sun Clock before it finish the maintenance.
This will let you to be driven out of the museum.
That's impossible.
It's absolutely would not be like this.
Gim Eun Dong.
Why are you always walking back and forth?
Coach!
Sun Clock is to be restored.
Really?
Since when?
What time?
But...
I have to destroy the Sun Clock.
Rotten brat!
How can you say this scary thing early in the morning?
When you destroy the Sun Clock it will also destroy you life.
If I destroy the Sun Clock then Lee Tae Ri will not be hurt.
Rotten brat!
Don't you want to go back?
So you're using Lee Tae Ri as an excuse?
After your first night with Tae Ri you feel that the life of a 14 years old man is very boring?
What is this?
This is Ms. Lee Tae Ri's item.
I always have this before I become an adult.
I should have returned it quickly to it's owner.
How did you have this?
This?
It's a charm that let People be married that is predestined by fate.
What?
You, you're saying that you're fated to Tae Ri?
Fate?
Rotten brat!
Gim Eun Dong!
Sober up a bit.
This is only a jewelry.
It's not some love bridge between you and Tae Ri.
It's only a jewelry.
Hey...
Hey...
Ah, really...
Hey.
Eun Dong!
Hwang Min Soo was sent to your side by uncle to destroy the Sun Clock.
Does the Sun Clock need to be repaired this time?
Then first stop the Sun Clock.
Vice Chairman also said that if you cause trouble, he will not bother Tae Ri.
When you destroy the Sun Clock it will also destroy your life.
Hwang Min Soo.
Ms. Tae Ri.
-=Next Episode Preview=-
This, is this a moment of impulsive emotion?
Ice, from now on Director Hwang is now an Ice.
Ah...
Soon will be Tae Ri's father and mother's death anniversary.
Oh my god.
Don't fight!
Enough!
I warned you.
Are you prepared to escape with Lee Tae Ri?
I really don't like Hwang Min Soo at your side.
I like.
Let's go.
I'll accept your request.
Hwang Min Soo.
Tae Ri.
Episode 8
What are you doing here?
Well...
It's...
I was thinking about something.
Thinking?
What if something was wrong with the sundial and everything stopped?
Hwang Min Soo, are you crazy?
If the sundial is fixed, then I would might have to leave here.
Leave here?
What are you talking about?
I want to be by your side, Miss Lee Tae Ri.
In order for that to happen, this is all I can do.
Hwang Min Soo, what are you trying to say.
If the sundial is broken, then my life is in ruins and so will the museum.
That might not be the case.
Even though the museum may be okay, you might be in danger.
You think about breaking the sundial in order to protect me?
Do you really expect me to believe that?
Yes.
It is true.
Do you know how much I trusted you?
Do you know how confident I was because you were by my side?
Lee Tae Ri.
Don't touch me.
How can this happen?
We are not kids going through puberty.
How can protecting me turn out this way?
Lee Tae Ri ssi!
Wait!
We need to talk.
Yes?
Ah, yes.
Director.
Please hear me out.
I wasn't really trying to break the sundial...
Freeze.
Manager Hwang is to be on freeze from now on.
Stay there until I think this through and clarify everything,
What is going on?
What did you threaten him with that he is trying to mess with the sundial?
I didn't threaten him.
I only adviced him to think what would be beneficial for you.
Why are you like this?
I don't like it.
I hate and despise the fact that Hwang Min Soo is by your side.
I like it.
So don't mess with Hwang Min Soo.
Then do you think the Vice President will leave him alone?
You know it too.
That I, like that him, was all innocent and foolish in just looking at you.
It wasn't me or my uncle that made you like this.
It was you who left me and chose my uncle instead.
Did it ever cross your mind that I might have had a reason for that?
I could have been in a crappy situation where I couldn't do as I wanted to.
There is no such thing.
You rascal.
Where have you been?
You didn't even answer your phone and you weren't at the museum either.
Teacher.
What should I do?
You really didn't break the sundial, right?
I should have just done that.
What are you talking about now?
You receiving the money and Lee Tae Ri ssi going to see her uncle, that's all because of me.
A woman's life is at stake because of me.
It might be better for me to break the sundial and never be able to go back.
You rascal, but this isn't the way to fix this!
What if not going back is my fate?
Gum Eun Dong!
This is no fate, this is a nightmare!
You have to think about your parents who are having nightmares every night.
If you talk about fate and not going back one more time, then it will really be the end.
you and me, bonded by loyalty as coach and students, will be finished.
Teacher, you really don't know.
How much Lee Tae Ri ssi trusted me and how much she smiled when she talked about friendship and loyalty.
You didn't see that.
Grandfather.
I'm alone again tonight.
I had promised you that I would bring a friend next time.
Grandfather, is it really impossible for me?
I only wanted somebody who would hold my hand warmly and someone I can lean on when I'm struggling.
Do I have to remain alone like this at the end?
at the end?
I... can't leave Lee Tae Ri ssi like this.
I am planning on closing down the museum since the groundbreaking ceremony of the amusement park has happened.
Do you want to go golfing and stay a night there with the head of the construction company for the amusement park this weekend?
That day...
Ah..
there is an event this weekend, right?
Yes.
Seung Jae.
Should I still do something for the anniversary of my brother's death?
You can meet up with Tae Ri and comfort her, that's all.
Vice-President.
Oh yes, you have to see your father that day too.
With an apologetic heart for Tae Ri.
With an apologetic heart for Tae Ri.
I have something to tell you.
Hwang Min Soo is nothing.
He is just a museum employee to me, so...
You grew up a bit.
So this is you trying to stop me from messing around with that man, right?
Since this is your reaction, it makes me want to destroy him more than ever.
Please stop, Uncle.
Well, then you can give up the museum.
If he weren't worth as much, then there would be no point for you to come here.
Isn't that right, Seung Jae?
Stop this.
I will not give up the museum.
Then I guess I will have to put him under my wings.
If he and Seung Jae are on the same team, then it will be easier for me to catch you.
Sadly, this happened while Lee Tae Ri's parents were on their way to pick her up from school.
And this day was also Miss Lee Tae Ri's birthday.
Tae Ri.
I couldn't help it.
Get ready.
In five days, the sundial will return to its former glory.
I think that will be sufficient, seeing from how fast the hands are going.
Teacher, what is the reason for this sudden reaction?
According to this book, it says that if the ying and yang are in harmony, then it will cause the sundial to work.
Ying and yang.
Are you talking about the sun and the moon?
If you you look at the logistics of the sundial's creation, then it could be the moon and the sun.
If you look at it in a magical sense, then it can be a woman and a man.
Up until now, there weren't any significant natural phenomena, so it was hard to estimate the restoration date.
How suddenly the sundial is recovering also startles me.
Director!
Your face is half of what it used to be!
Manager Hwang.
Apparently the sundial is coming back soon.
When?
Are you sure?
It will return to its original form in five days.
Then there might be no reason for you to protect the sundial.
Lee Tae Ri ssi.
You don't think that I was really trying to betray you?
Right?
You can go now.
Wait.
Hwang Min Soo, what is this?
What are you doing?
bo-ssam (carry a sack on your back)...
I want to put you in a sack and run away.
What?
This car...is the one you bought for me.
Riding in this car...even if we have to drive around the whole country, let's work on your misunderstanding.
Hwang Min Soo, why are you being so stubborn?
From accidents to solving them, why are you so rash and irresponsiblity like a kid?
I had a reason.
The real reason why I was uncertain in front of the sun clock.
Because of a secret I have not told you... secret?
Can there be a secret that cannot be shared between friends?
Yes, the reason is....
Forget it, I don't want to hear it
Don't push me away!
If you don't hear me out, then you will push me away from your heart.
Do you know the phrase "Ignorance is bliss"?
Do you know the phrase "Ignorance is bliss"?
If that secret is so grave that it will end up hurting me, then don't say it.
Just keep it as a secret forever and leave.
Secretary Hong.
I think I need to work.
I can't be a pathetic head of the museum who is swayed because of personal problems.
Director, if you could specify that...
Director, if you could specify that...
Something that's like doenjang stew.
Something that is so earthy that after one mouthful, I will feel refreshed.
Then I recommend a Traditional Experience program.
Traditional Experience program?
Yes.
And I also encourage you to visit the house where the program would be held yourself.
Hwang Min Soo planned that though.
You.. you!
Father!
Why are you here again?
I wanted some doenjang stew.
A doenjang stew cooked by mother's heart.
Heart?
What are you?
What are you that you keep on interfering our marriage?
Eun Dong.
What?
There is a history called Eun Dong ' between you and mother.
How could I interfere the two of you?
Here.
Father, can I really drink this?
There is a saying that drinking is the best way for two men to get over their problems.
Manager Hwang.
Please have a drink and forgive me for all the rude behavior.
Then I will drink this with a thankful heart since this is the first glass you poured for me.
You remind me of my son.
Eun Dong's wish was to drink under the moonlight while thinking about a man's hardships in life.
Father...
Miss Lee Tae Ri!
I have something to discuss with you about the traditional experience program with you.
But...
What brings you here?
It's because of doenjang stew.
I wanted some doenjang stew made by Mother.
Director, but what is it that you want to talk about the program?
I want the both of you to be a part of the museum.
I hope that you will let us know the foods you normally eat and the customs you still practice.
You won't be disappointed with the pay.
We don't need to be paid...
Director, we have to show the tents first, I guess.
It's where we store the golden doenjang of the Geum family, made by these skills god gave me.
Right, hubby?
The two of you, please wait in the room.
Go ahead.
Lee Tae Ri ssi.
Please sit comfortably.
I didn't think that we would meet again...
Our relationship must be special.
I also feel like Eun Dong is linking again and again.
This is more of a coincidence than a special relationship.
If there are multiple coincidences, then it is a special relationship.
Eun Dong's dream was to become a swimmer, like me.
He is a kid with a dream and a warm family.
Why would he leave home?
It's because of destiny.
He may have had to leave home because he was destined to meet someone.
He was only fourteen; would destiny meant that much?
Yes.
I think so.
This is Eun Dong.
He is pretty.
His eyes are warm too.
Right?
Don't you think he will grow up to be a reliable and great guy?
Mamma mia!
This kid...
I know him!
Do you remember him?
Of course!
This kid saved me.
Exactly!
He might be your fated one...
I have to find this kid for his family.
Lee Tae Ri ssi.
Are you really going to search for Eun Dong?
You don't even know where he is.
He probably didn't go far.
Because since he is a child who grew up eating homemade food, he would be a sweet child who wouldn't make his parents suffer.
What if he doesn't want to come back?
Because he has someone he wants to protect.
What if it's that person who is holding him back?
Everyone at that age can dream of deviance.
But to leave the boy's life astray because of his sudden impulse is not what adults should do.
This is a sudden impulse?
Hwang Min Soo, I am not confident.
If you would stay by my side like this and stay as you are right now, I don't know about that.
Lee Tae Ri SSI.
Like how the child must come home,
I want Hwang Min Soo to get out of my life.
You must.
Geum Eun Dong.
What are you doing right now?
I'm packing, as you see.
Did you ultimately choose nonsense for love?
You are packing right now to run away with Lee Tae Ri at night!
Aren't I right?
I'm going to go back.
Lee Tae Ri ssi told me to leave her.
Have you made up your mind for sure?
You aren't going to go against your word later?
That's not going to happen.
But I need to take care of this before I go.
Why with that piece of metal again?
You said that even when the sleeves touch each other, it's meant to be.
I am going to end the relationship whether I give this to Lee Tae Ri or I keep it.
You can't do that!
You go to end the relationship, but you feel like this isn't it, so you end up repeating the relationshpi over and over again.
That is what a relationship is.
I'll be going now.
Welcome back to Sagwameori!
Soon Shim.
I am so proud of you!
You even brought us a sponsor while you were resting.
Why is that because of Soon Shim?
It was because Hong Shil is a friend of Lee Tae Ri.
Then everything is going back to where it was, right?
Including who is the leader.
Now, the leader is chosen at random.
Manager!
What is that?
Well, I thought for the sake of Sagwameori's development, the leadership should be fair.
No.
I don't want to.
Ha Soon Shim.
If you want to be a leader that badly, then you should have done a good job before.
She goes around creating gossip.
But she wants to be the leader?
Yang Mimi.
Are you still jealous of me?
How many years is this, starting from when you were a trainee?
Don't fight, you guys!
Ha Soon Shim!
Stop it!
Are you okay?
Hong Shil, are you alright?
I'm alright...
But you don't have to go see Soon Shim?
I came to see you, Hong Shil.
Because my heart felt heavy (frustrated)...
If it's because of Tae Ri, I don't have anything to say.
I...have to leave soon.
But...
I don't think I can leave like this.
I want to do one last thing for Lee Tae Ri,
I don't know what that is.
I thought you might know.
Tae Ri has 5 seasons...
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and sweet-potatoes what, sweet-potatoes?
for Tae Ri, when it's that season... it feels like a sweet-potato stuck in her heart...frustrating and difficult.
But, it is now sweet potato season...
It will be Tae Ri's parents' memorial soon.
By memorial. you mean when her mom and dad passed away?
That day was Lee Tae Ri's birthday...
Hwang Min Soo, how can be looking after Hong Shil in front of me?
What, is it because she's Lee Tae Ri's friend?
Hwang Min Soo!
It's a warning...
Father,
I'm going to see Lee Tae Ri's parents.
So please help me this time...
What!
Again...it's money!
Yes, it's money.
No, please Lee Tae Ri.
I really don't like money.
Please take it back, please.
Please don't refuse.
Hwang Min Guk accepting is the same as Hwang Min Soo receiving it.
Why do you keep giving me a bunch of money?
This money...is for all the hard work Hwang Min Soo did for me.
Ms. Tae Ri Lee.
Thank you very much, for letting go of my younger brother.
My brother is still a kid.
For him to act like a man in front of you, there is much that he lacks.
It's not like that.
Hwang Min Soo, more than any other man I've met, was a trust-worthy and good man.
That's why I want to ask you,
Until Hwang Min Soo can fulfill his dreams, please be his shelter.
Shelter?
Yes.
So that you can be a strong and sturdy shelter for him,
I will do my best.
Oh, my .
Ms. Tae Ri Lee.
Please contact me if you ever need my assistance.
But please...it's a secret.
What is this?
It's medicine.
When your heart aches, there is no better medicine than sweet strawberry milk.
After we drink this, let's treat the scar from your loss.
Ms. Tae Ri.
I...will leave.
But, I have a request.
Request?
A last farewell... a last farewell?
Yes.
When it's back working, please give me a hug in front of the sun clock.
Lee Tae Ri style...
Why, of all things, in front of the sun clock?
Because the sun clock brought us together.
So, even saying goodbye, it feels right to do it in front of the sun clock.
Italy...
First of all, it looks like a boot...
And Rome.
The populations is... 68150000...
In the Mediterranean,
Representative food is...
Pizza.
What are you doing?
Why are you so engrossed in Italy?
Before I leave, I want to give Lee Tae Ri a present.
It's exactly like Romeo and Juliet.
One side is money, the other is heart.
Teacher, what do you think will be good?
What will be the best present on your parent's memorial?
On such a sad day, a shot of soju is the best.
soju?
Yes, professor/teacher
Today at midnight, it will return
Teacher, is this true?
Midnight is when the energy of the sun and moon is in harmony.
In this condition, before the night ends... it will return to it's original form
It must be a present, mom and dad sent.
Hong Shil!
I really want to thank you...
What's all this?
For a memorial service, instead of soju, wine is best.
I want to make some good food and serve it with the wine to Lee Tae Ri's mom and dad.
Who are you?
Hong Shil, this is my older brother.
Hello, I'm your fan.
What is this?
You said you will just remove your things while Tae Ri wasn't here.
Can I at least shake your hand?
Yes.
Oh, really... hyung (older brother)!
it's burning...
If Tae Ri finds out, she'll really get mad...
Don't worry...
It's first time ine a year since she met her parents.
Do you think still stay mad?
Tae Ri does not do this kind of thing...
She spends her parent's memorial quietly at home.
Why spent it quietly?
It's the one time in a year that she gets to meet her parents.
That right!
With food cooked with love and devotion consoling the tired soles of parents.
This great guy...
This guy is my younger brother.
Look at her...
Just one smack...
Perhaps, it is true that my birth was lonely...
Would you like me to be with you?
No, I will do as I usually do...
If this is my fate, I should accept it.
Mamma Mia!
(My goodness)
Lee Tae Ri...welcome
Hwang Min Soo, what are you doing here?
What is all this food?
I thought that today is your mom and dad's memorial...
I wanted to be with you
I always spend mom and dad's memorial quietly, by myself.
Don't ruin an important day, and leave now.
Why are you wasting time when your mom and dad are waiting?
Food tastes better when it's warm.
Hwang Min Soo!
Get mad later and greet your mom and dad first.
It's been a while since you met them.
Are you just going to stay mad?
Do you think it's going alright?
Do you think Lee Tae Ri will hit him with the silk screen?
I don't know....
I don't know anything...
So... why don't you know?
by the way... when this night is over, your younger brother will be leaving Tae Ri, right?
Yes, I'll put my life on it.
Don't worry about anything.
But Ms. Hong Shil, after meeting you in person your face is very friendly
I am an advocate of humanism
Ah, that's how it is...
Ohhh...
Tae Ri, your parents say that it tastes great!
It's true!
Even though it looks a bit strange, it tastes great.
Because food is about love...
Hwang Min Soo, did you prepare this by yourself?
Mamma mia.
What do I do?
What's going on?
Ay...
I didn't mean...it's just that there was something stuck on your forehead...
I just can't stand hair stuck on anyone's face...
I really need to take it off your face right now...
Either way, Lee Tae Ri...
Surprise.
Tae Ri, I'm sorry.
I really had no idea.
He asked me to just open the door for him...
You guys worked hard making the food...
Huh, Tae Ri, you just smiled...
You feel moved, don't you?
But what should we do?
This isn't everything...
Happy birthday, Lee Tae Ri!
Today is when you lost your parents, but it is also the day your first met them.
But it seems you have not been able to celebrate your birthday properly since your parents died.
That's why we prepared this.
Lee Tae Ri, from this moment, we are going back to age 14.
14 years old?
Yes.
You will say your saddest moments out loud, then blow out the candle one by one.
And when it's all over, you will live only with the good memories.
Here you go...from age 14.
When I was 14, I lost my parents so I was very sad.
When I was 15, I went to school in Milano and my Italian improved quite a bit.
At age 16, I started fencing and went to see the sun clock for the first time with my grandfather.
At age 28 now, I met a great friend and because of that friend
I'm not scared of the dark anymore.
so I'm grateful and hesitant.
I don't want to send me away
But I'll be able to hold on to the great memories he made for me and send him without regrets.
What are you doing here at this hour?
Did you come here because you know that the sun clock is working again?
Yes.
Yes, I know.
But today, I came to see Tae Ri.
Tae Ri?
I want to tell Tae Ri everything today...
It's not time yet.
Wait until Tae Ri is able to accept (understand) it.
No, I will do it today.
How I became this way, from the beginning, about everything.
How I became this way, from the beginning, about everything.
Thank you for today.
Let's go now.
I'll grant your wish, Hwang Min Soo.
I think I can do well now.
Lee Tae Ri style goodbye.
Hwang Min Soo!
Yes, Tae Ri.
Where will you go now?
Home, where my family is waiting.
Home...
All I need now is a last farewell and I'll be able to leave.
Where is this place?
This place...is where I talk to my grandfather.
When I am worried or sad, I come here for comfort and feel restored.
That there...the brightest shining star is my grandfather.
My grandfather...always wanted to show me the night sky.
Everything changes as the time passes, but a star stays in its place without changing.
an unchanging star...
Yeah...
There is a star that's never changing all year-round.
Which star is that?
The pole star...
The pole star stays in it's place whether it's raining or snowing...
Like a lover who never leaves my side, no matter how hard things get.
That is really cool...that pole star.
Isn't it?
I promised grandfather if I ever meet someone like that, I'd bring him here.
I think I found that person...
Lee Tae Ri, I don't think I can leave...
Stay by my side and don't be swayed.
Then I will sleep here tonight.
I believe in Manager Hwang.
I will tuck you in.
Why do you want to protect me?
Because you are a good person.
I will change the terms to being the public ambassador.
Instead of Choi Seung Jae, I want Hwang Min Soo.
You can't like me.
Choi Seung alone is good enough for me to lose people because of money.
I will never let you take Hwang Min Soo away from me.
I want to protect her perfectfully, who doesn't have any man except for me in the world to trust.
I think that it will be back to normal soon.
It will go back to where it was?
No way.
Really?
It is a token that leads me to a true special relationship.
Are we really special?
What are you doing here...
If you want to protect Lee Tae Ri, then stop the sundial first.
Apparently Hwang Min Soo is a man sent by your uncle to stay by your side in order to break the sundial.
-That is nonsense.
-I want to be by your side.
In order for me to do that, this is the only way.
If the sundial is broken, then my life is going to stop and the museum is going to die too.
If you break the sundial, then you will never be able to go back.
What if not going back is my destiny?
I hate and despise the fact that Hwang Min Soo is by your side.
I like it.
Do you think the Vice President will leave him alone?
Hwang Min Soo is nothing.
Since you don't want me to mess with him myself, you are going to set things straight yourself.
Hwang Min Soo, what are you?
Because of my secret...
Don't tell me that secret if it is something so grave that will make me feel betrayed.
Stop it!
How could he care for Hong Shil in front of me?
This is a warning.
This is Eun Dong.
Mamma mia!
I know this kid!
I will find this kid.
What if he can't go back because he has someone he wants to protect?
Like how this kid needs to come back home, I want you to leave me.
I... have to leave soon.
I wanted to do something for you for the last time.
The 28-year old me met a very good friend, and you created so many precious memories that I don't deserve, so I think that I can let you go while holding onto those memories.
When the sundial comes back, please hug me once.
Let's go now.
I will do what you want.
Episode 9
This is where I came to talk to my grandfather.
When I am fearful or have worries, I get comforted here.
Over there, the star that twinkles the most is my grandfather.
My grandfather always wanted to show me the night sky.
When time passes, everything changes, but stars are always unchanging and they guard the same place.
An unchanging star?
there is a star that does not change all year round what is that?
The North Star.
come rain come snow it remains in the same position like a lover that will never leave my side even in hard times
He's a really cool guy
The North Star.
Thats right if i ever find such a person,
I promised my grandfather i would bring him here
I think I found him
Lee Taeri
I don't think I'll be able to go.
Hwang Minsoo.
Don't go.
I won't.
,
I'll just continue to be by your side.
Lee Taeri the sundail is back to normal right?
Yes, everything is complete now.
Shall we go look at it again?
No, I only want to look at you right now.
Like this.
Tae Ri.
What are you doing here?
Let's have a talk.
I have nothing to say.
Then listen!
It has to be today.
You have to hear this.
What's with you?
Aren't you curious?
Why I left you.
You don't want know what happened?
That's right I'm not at all interested.
because what is important to me is right now.
Minsoo let's go.
Dont worry tonight just have a good rest cause today is a good say.
Think only good thoughts
Thank you.
Sleep tight.
Tae Ri.
Are you asleep?
Not yet... did you get there fine?
Yes.
But why aren't you asleep?
I can't seem to fall asleep today.
I'm responsible for you, so don't worry and close your eyes.
We are meeting early tomorrow so quickly go to sleep.
Alright, I will.
And from now on, when it's only us...
Call me that way.
Tae Ri.
Sleep tight, Tae Ri.
You slept here?
Aren't you tired?
No, not at all.
Ms. Tae Ri.
Tae Ri.
Isn't the weather beautiful today?
the sky is really blue and every looks so excited, Taeri-ssi too...
Taeri too ls shinning
Really?
Yes.
Then let us change too
Make a right.
ResignationLetter.
Thank you for everything.
This is my resignation.
Seung Jae.
You don't need to feel guilty.
Stopping Taeri and making the theme park were never jobs you could do.
you still dont understand
Why i put you with taeri?
Taeri came to find me in a rage.
You've already done your job.
I'd like to stop listening to your orders and chasing after Taeri.
You've been completely abandoned by Taeri, haven't you?
Right?
What's certain is that there will be no more reasons to see you.
Do you think you can find Taeri again without my help?
Yes.
I can find her.
Let's see each other again, Sunjae.
Yes?
Hwang Minsoo has a girl?
Ah.
Delicious.
Really?
It is delicious.
Ms. Tae Ri.
it tastes even better because you fed it to me
Then, let's take a photo 'cause its the sweet first day we eat ice cream together
Okay.
Ready.
One, two, three!
Here.
What is this?
It tells you how beautiful and lovely you are whenever you are upset, think of me and look at the mirror.
Then you will become the happiest womean in the world
Do you like it?
That's a relief.
I dont know!
I know nothing!
I don't know anything!
What are you!
Where is this place?
What is with you Ahjussi!
It's all over for me.
My life is over.
I am not this kind of a frivolous person.
I, Hwang Min Gook, am not the type of person to give my body to someone whom I have not given my soul to.
Don't cry!
I don't remember anything.
Is there anything you remember?
I don't know.
What did you do to me!
My socks are off.
Eundong!
The sundial is restored.
I will do everything in my power to have the sundial recognized as a national treasure.
I promise this as the curator.
Thank you.
coach
What?
Why are you still the same?
Didnt you hug her in front of the sundail?
I didn't
What?
Why?
I'm just going to stay this way.
I think this is how it should be.
what?
I'm the North Star.
To Taeri, I'm like the unchanging North Star.
The North Star.
Secretary Hong, I want to work
I dont think i would be tired if i world all night on a day like this.
What else is there to do?
there are a few projects but...
What's the matter?
Uh...
Hwang Min gook.
Lee Tae Ri.
This can't be.
Our Eun Dong
Let me go!
I will tell you everything.
i can"t hold back anymore.
The problem with this kid is
I know.
Hwang Minsoo is like a child who is innocent and truthful.
I know it is hard for you to take care of such a man.
That's right.
Mingook, you went through alot of hardship at my house yesterday.
I also want to thank you for coming and giving me a party.
With that sincerity.
I want to reward you.
Re re reward.
Reward?
Secretary Hong.
yes director
This here is Hwang Min Kuk.
He an asia games gold medalist until recently he was a high school swim couch look to see if there is a position for such a wonderful person
The must dynamic and safe position in our museum
Hwang Mingook.
I'll be counting on you.
While they didn't hold a wedding, they were practically a married couple.
Is that right?
Then, that woman now?
She had a hard time looking for Hwang Min Soo.
But in the years after that no one has heard from her.
That woman.
Is there a way to find her?
People say she is close with Hwang Min Kuk
keep looking into it.
ASAP
Na Hong Shil!
what is wrong with you today?
I also don't know.
Unni are you sick?
Maybe you've dieted too much
Sis, have a little of this.
Tell the truth.
Yesterday you didn't come back to the dorms. where were you?
You were also late for practice.
You smell like alcohol.
You're dating aren't you?
The guy that saved you the day sunshim grabed your hair
Its him right?
That's not it!
Soon shim, that's really not it!
You drank with Hwang Minsoo all night didn't you?
Are you two dating?
I said that's not it.
Hwan Minsoo isn't me that he's dating.
If it isn't you?
Who is it?
I said you didn't have to take me home.
Starting today I wll take you home every day.
My brother said the basics of being a man is become your woman's feet.
Hwang Minguk seems like a really good person.
You two are alike yeah
Because we are brothers your parents must be very happy
To have such nice sons
I know that not how it is.
they've gone through alot of trouble because of me still they will always be by you side and cheer you on.
Because parent are always that way.
Mom, I miss you.
Mother.
And father?
he's not home and grandfather isn't too
By the way, why are you here?
I missed you.
You missed me?
Oh.
ahh... you dont have to
This is a present.
From your child.
Eundong's present.
Eundong?
Yes, Eundong asked me to buy this for him and give it to you.
Because your hands are always rough
Eundong thinks you hands are the warmest and best hands in the world.
Like dried persimmons, they're dry on the outside but inside they're chewy and soft.
Did Eundong contact you/
Yes, he called my brother said he was fine.
He said to let you know
He says he's having an experience that you can't even buy for money.
Exactly where and in what situation is he living in?
Eundong is really fine right?
Did he say he was coming home?
Yes, he will come so believe in him and wait a little longer.
of course. of course.
He's my son I have to believe..
He is my son after all.
I fed him and clothed him with these hands.
EunDongie
I love you what?
EunDongie said to relay it.
He loves his mother.
I love him too
Goodbye my love, goodbye.
I suppose I will have to erase all the memories that I could not say.
I loved you, I was thankful for you.
Lee Taeri and Hwang Mnsoo are dating?
why is my mood like this?
Do I really like that Hwang minsoo person?
Heart, whats going on?
why are yo so late?
what now?
is it urgent?
It's got to do with my pride
Every time you do this, I'm so scared that I feel like I'm going to die.
manager, can you find out Lee Taeri's schedule?
Lee Taeri?
why?
There is something I need to confirm when I meet her.
What sort of suit costs 500,000 won?
Why do I keep getting caught up in my greed?
Still, if Lee Taeri hires me, my annual salary will be at least a hundred million won.
I'm home.
okay
Dude, whats with your face?
I just went home. saw my mom
Home what did you say there?
That I would definetly be back.
go back?
when?
You should have said earlier
I got so excited that I even bought a suit.
if my mum knew i had become like this, she would be shocked right?
of course, even if she is your mother is it that easy to believe?
How about Taei?
would she believe?
Taeri?
you two are calling each other by first names know?
how did you two become so close?
This won't do. lets go to the sundail and quickly hug Taeri i can't fine.
I understand that you two are inseparable.
right know you are decieving her?
does a real man do that?
Right know you are a con man
Then i can just make it real.
huh?
i'm just going to stay this way with her.
I miss you.
I miss you.
Why is it like this?
Tell me your wish.
I will fulfill you wish.
What is this?
EunDongie say your hands are the warmest and best hand in the world.
He says that your hand is like a dried persimmon, rough on the outside but soft inside.
Those are words EuDongie says
Hwang Minsoo, what is this?
Do you remember?
The building I promised to build you for the sundial when you got the museum.
What are you playing at?
I turned in my resignation
I have given up everything
This is one thing i wont let go of
Build that for my uncle instead.
I dont need it
We promised even if we broke up you would accept this model from me.
You're great at lying and betraying people.
You want to keep a ten year old promise?
This is for you but also for me.
if you keep this one there will be no more promises between us.
Hey, dung fly
You are happy these days.
yes, I am so happy time flies by
Enjoy it while you can
what is your relationship with the director now?
It's -ing.
It's present progressive.
Hwang minsoo
If you are trying to play with Lee Taeri stop now.
I am not playing around
Are you confident?
Yes.
Dont worry i will try hard to keep her from shedding tears
Don't promise like kids who raise their fists first.
Try making a plan for the traditional living experience, with current issues like well being and healing.
Huh?
well being and healing?
I am going to be watching you
I'm going to see whether you're actually helpful to the director or not.
If that's it, please trust me.
If it's for the director, I'll do it properly.
Tae Ri.
Director, where are you off to?
I have work outside.
Work outside?
A museum directors' meeting.
then when you are done i will see you at the museum.
I am working late
Receiving this three times your face becomes like that of a twenty year old yes?
Yes, miss.
But your face is so nice that even if you receive it once your skin will be beautiful.
Then, please wait for a moment.
Okay.
You really must have been in a hurry.
I guess if you want to date a younger man this is the least you can do.
How did you get here?
I found your schedule.
I have something I want to tell you privately.
Privately?
Yes, Hwang Min Soo.
The reason that you are getting the most expensive massage at this shop.
This isn't for Hwang Minsoo.
It is a present for myself.
Keeping my beauty to continue receiving love is a woman's duty and competence.
You have a good excuse.
Of course, it's not unnatural to want to appear beautiful to a younger boyfriend.
whats the reason you are so bright anad sheerful?
Hwang minsoo.
I think I like Oppa.
really?
At last you're able to recognize a good man.
That could be anyways, this time i am going to break the jinx for real.
Jinx?
yes
The wierd jinx that all the men I know you snatch from me..
Lets say you knew Sunjae Oppa before me.
Minsoo Oppa, I can't be like that too.
so?
I am going to make him my man
I will be leaving. i have alot to do.
its not going to be easy because Hwang Min Soo is my North Star.
He doesn't change 365 days of the year.
do want to leave?
I have to receive treatment on my back now.
I heard that he was friendly with Hwang Min Soo's brother.
Hwang Min Guk.
When did you get here?
now you look different really?
how?
your face is glowing
Your skin is bright.
The directors' meetings usually make people glow.
glowing is glowing. but you also look younger
In the future, I'll have to go to that meeting more often.
how about dinner?
should we go out to eat something yummy?
i had some earlier
I have to finish the traditional living experience by tomorrow.
I'll finish this real quick and take you home.
Oh, I had something I wanted to discuss with you.
I can't talk with someone like you with a clear mind.
If you have something to say, let's doing it after we've each had a bottle.
When i have something imprtant to say i dont drink.
especially soju thats right
That's the difference between you and me.
The difference between a person and a piece of ice.
Hwang minsoo your brother has a woman i hear what are you talking about?
I heard that while they didn't have a wedding they were practically a couple.
am i right?
don't dare touch my brother no, i think i should
How strange of a 25 year old could have had such a deep relationship?
You used your brother to get money and he threw away the woman like an old shoe.
I guess your parents didn't teach you all right from wrong because they were too busy running the mill.
you jerk!
what is this?
Choi Sunjae gave it to me
He said he'd build me a exhibition hall for the sundial.
really?
MInsoo what am i supposed to do in this situation?
let me ask you something are you going to be moved by this?
no, i won't
Because I have you
Then take it if he says he'll build it for you.
Let's see how well he builds it.
But until this is done, let me take care of Choi Sunjae.
If he tries anything I'll be able to take care of it.
alright
Lets have a cup of coffee
But you dont drink coffee from now on i will
I want to show at least one change since I've started dating you.
Conversations over alcohol disappear like dewdrops the next day but conversations over coffee will stay.
I'll be back.
Coffee isn't even bitter anymore.
I don't put sugar in my coffee at this time of day.
Why is it like this again?
thank you.
I am so happy
Being able to be Lee Taeri's man i am really happy.
I am so happy
Being able to be Lee Taeri's man i am really happy.
I am so happy
Being able to be Lee Taeri's man i am really happy.
There's some talk against your boy.
If the woman that's come between you and Sylvia is our little suffragette...
I want you to swear on your St Anthony that you won't leave me.
I'll do no such thing.
Will you be my mistress tonight?
Yes!
My husband is going out to war tomorrow.
But I'd keep off the grass.
You cannot conceive of the explosives the armies throw at each other.
Had the stuffing knocked out of me.
GUNSHOT I won't take his money.
You usually forgive a fellow who shoots himself.
I don't.
Couldn't you bring yourself to seduce that little kitchen maid?
There'd have been a chance for us.
What I stand for is gone.
And yet I may not say this is an accursed war.
This programme contains some strong language.
This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting
Edward's command is at Rouen, or "somewhere in France", we're supposed to say.
Bertram tells me you lost a window during the last raid?
Are you going to the Sackvilles'?
I thought so.
..it's also to tell the French, best shut up about the single command.
No, no votes for you I'm afraid.
It's going to be for married women over 30.
It's a serious problem on the whole front.
Horses decimated by pink-eye.
You should put that fellow, Hotchkiss, in charge of the horse lines.
The warhorse needs to be hardened.
Mollycoddling will ruin him.
Hotchkiss is the man you need in France.
Hotchkiss?
You'll find him in Horse World, advertising embrocation.
"Get hold of Hotchkiss!"
The Comet will back you.
The Comet's first edition, My Lord.
General, Sylvia wants a pass to the Infantry Base Depot in Rouen.
She wants to see her husband.
Strictly out of bounds to wives, I'm afraid, Mrs Tietjens.
Hmm, and what about mistresses?
I bet there's a few of those behind the lines.
I think it's jolly unfair.
Here you are, Bertram.
Might as well spoil your dinner as your breakfast!
The Comet exposes the scandal of our out-of-touch command in Flanders.
I'm sure it does, but it's your own fault for building up General Perry in the first place.
Wait until the German spring offensive gives him a bloody nose, Beichen, and then we can bring him home.
Is that why you're keeping the Commander-in-Chief short of troops, Bertram?
If we gave Perry the men, he'd lose half of them in a week.
If I had my way, we'd let the French go to blazes.
Quite.
There won't always be a European war, but there'll always be an Empire.
What about Salonika, Bertram?
Salonika?
Nathan, isn't that where your people originally...
Not originally, my dear!
THEY ALL LAUGH POLITELY
I say, it would be nice if we could forget the war just for five minutes...
TRUMPETS AND CANNON FIRE
I give up!
Move to adjourn.
Come on, my dear.
GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSION
NEARBY EXPLOSION
Mother!
I'm just finishing.
It'll be the finish of you if you don't...
EXPLOSION Mother!
I'm writing to Christopher.
At least HE isn't in the casualty lists.
I always look.
Of course he's not.
He's not in the fighting.
His brother got him into a job looking after horses!
EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE
TRUMPETS PLAY
There's the all-clear.
Sylvia, I need you to rally round.
Johnny's behaving appallingly.
Oh, what, you mean about your divertissement?
It's not a divertissement.
I'm bolting!
Oh, Bobbie!
You mean you and...?
But he's...
It's not his fault he's a Jew.
Fat, I was going to say.
It's his fault he's fat.
He wants to marry me.
So I need you to get Johnny over the hump.
No, just take him out and about.
He's a good old sausage.
I want to do my best for him.
That's all very well, but I've a mind to visit Christopher in France.
I've written to General Campion.
I wish Tietjens would write to his damned wife, or, at any rate, stop her from writing to me.
It's not my job to reassure the wives of officers their husbands are still alive, damn it.
It's bad enough having to write to them when they're not.
There's a movement order come in for Captain Tietjens, sir, from the War Office, Room G14-R.
It was mis-routed and has only now caught up, I'm afraid.
Movement?
To where?
Divisional horse transport.
Well, you can tell Room G14-R, whoever the hell they are, that I'm not parting with Captain Tietjens!
He's the only officer on the base who can get his draft into marching order on time.
Not that he isn't a confounded nuisance.
I could give them Captain McKechnie when he's back from divorce leave.
He's sane enough for horses, isn't he?
Captain McKechnie HAS returned from leave, sir, but he omitted to get divorced.
How DARE he not get divorced!
He told me his wife was co-habiting with an...
Egyptian, wasn't it?
Some sort of dago, anyway.
No, sir, an EGYPTOLOGIST.
They've agreed to share her.
That dirty dog!
I'll strip him of his commission!
A damn fine officer when he isn't going mad, and a Vice Chancellor's Latin prize man, as well.
Another brilliant fellow, like Tietjens.
That's a thought.
They can be brilliant together.
BELL RINGS
Does "subter" take the accusative or the ablative?
Both.
Accusative when it's "under" as a motion, and ablative when it's "under" as a state.
"... pictured at Lady Hazlitt's Ball
"with the Honourable Johnnie Pelham..."
"..
Mrs Christopher Tietjens,
"whose husband is in hospital at the Front"!
Sylvia must have told them that herself.
HE SCOFFS
The paper wouldn't put the knife into her.
Women like Sylvia are the jam on their bread and butter.
But why would she do that?
To let him know she's on the warpath.
Well, don't worry about Christopher, it was only pneumonia, and not at the Front.
He's 100 miles from the nearest German trench.
His job is kitting out fresh troops on their way to the fighting.
Nothing to worry about but air raids.
But are they dropping bombs on him?
My dear, they're dropping bombs on you, and yet here you are.
But I thought Christopher was looking after horses somewhere safe.
That's the War Office for you.
But an Infantry Base Depot is a soft posting, so long as you're not sent back to your battalion.
Anything but the trenches!
THEY ROAR AND SCREAM
Move it, move it, move it!
Shoulder...arms!
Present...arms!
Shoulder...arms!
Quick...march!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right...
Hmm.
General Campion is attaching Captain McKechnie to my unit for rations and discipline.
What's that about?
I can't say as I can say, sir.
"A Vice-Chancellor's Latin prize man".
Well, I'm sure that will come in useful(!
)
fire-extinguishers.
We indented the Royal Engineers.
Sir.
The Royal Engineers said, as per army directive 1BDR 3417, for fire-extinguishers, we should apply to Ordnance.
Ordnance said there's no provision for them for Canadian units passing through an Infantry Base Depot, and that the proper course would be to obtain them from a civilian firm and charge them against barrack damages.
Yes, sir.
I have here a letter from the leading British manufacturer of fire-extinguishers, telling me that they have been forbidden by the War Office to sell fire-extinguishers to anyone but to the War Office direct.
Thank God we have a navy.
Yes, sir.
Cardiff Police Office... 0-9 Morgan is outside, sir.
Application for compassionate leave.
His wife has sold their laundry business to someone, name of Evans.
Now she can't get the money.
True in as far as it goes.
The police say his wife is now living with Mr Evans, a prize-fighter, and we should keep 0-9 Morgan here if we know what's good for him.
In he comes.
Sir.
0-9 Morgan, present yourself to the officer, at the double!
Well now, 0-9 Morgan... ..because there are things I have to discuss with Christopher, and what is the point in being permanent secretary of the Department of Transport if you can't transport me -
I put it like that - between London and Rouen?
This is family business, Mark.
I have to go to the office.
SHE SIGHS
As far as I'm concerned,
Groby is Christopher's to do what he likes with.
So if you can produce his written authorisation,
I have no objection to your living at Groby.
But, of course, if what you say is true, he might want to live at Groby with Miss Wannop.
Well, that's why I'm asking you now...
I'm afraid you overestimate my authority, which does not extend to France, and in any case, does not exceed General Campion's in matters that concern the army.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Utter nonsense!
I'll buy a ticket at the station!
See if they can stop me.
Never known a woman like her.
She says she's going to come and see for herself!
On no account...
On NO account is Mrs Tietjens to be allowed within 50 miles of Rouen.
Understood?
Inform the War Office, the Provost Marshal, the port authorities and the rail authorities.
I will not have skirts around my HQ!
More importantly, General Perry is now on the telephone twice a day.
He has troops who were due to be relieved weeks ago, and I have troops waiting for Ordnance to supply them with eyebrow tweezers while our political masters keep changing their minds whether to send them up the line or ship them to Salonika or Mesopotamia or Timbuktu!
But I have one draft of Canadian troops ready to go to the Front today.
That's the draft prepared by Captain Tietjens's unit.
Captain Thurston, do I have the trains or do I not?
You have the trains, sir, and the co-operation of the French railway, going east to the Front, certainly.
I want these troops on their way to Flanders before London can blink!
Oui, mon general.
Champagne at two o'clock!
Which train, Madam?
Oh, I don't know.
Dover, I expect.
Sylvia!
Potty!
What are you doing here?
King's Messenger!
King's Messenger?
Yes.
Glorified postman, really, but frightfully important!
Locked carriages, private cabins, saluted through the gate.
Oh!
Where are you off to?
Where are you?
This way, sir.
Gosh, I've missed you, Sylvia.
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
Thank you.
Captain.
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Everyone got a glass?
Splendid.
PHONE RINGS
Well, then, it's been our pleasure to fit out you and your men for the task ahead.
Somebody deal with that telephone.
It's a great task, and thanks to Captain Tietjens and his unit, you Canadians go to the front in good order.
You will be relieving soldiers who've been in the trenches for many weeks.
Believe me, 3,000 fresh troops under keen, young officers is just what the Hun doesn't want to face in our part of the line.
Discipline and training will keep you alive.
Remember it.
I'll be at the railhead to see you off.
Form-up at 2000, air raids permitting.
That's in the event of there being no further orders.
Thank you!
Captain Tietjens, come with me!
The draft has been countermanded.
I'll find out what's going on, but you'd better be ready to get the men back under canvas tonight.
Yes, sir.
May I ask...?
No, you may not.
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
I can't tell you where overseas these new orders will be taking you, but, believe me, the war where you're going is every bit as important as the war in Flanders and you WILL get your chance at the Hun.
PHONE RINGS
I dare say you're disappointed.
Stop that telephone.
But I know that you Canadians will enjoy the challenge and some rather warmer weather.
That's, er, a clue for you.
You will form your men up at 1700 hours for the march to the railhead.
We'll try to send you off by 1900, before the expected air raid.
That's all, gentlemen.
Good luck!
It was Major Perowne, sir, calling for a driver.
He's at the station.
Good.
And...
And he's got Mrs Tietjens with him.
WHISPERS:
I will break you for this.
I will smash you.
General!
How lovely!
We've all been missing you.
Tietjens.
May I ask a small favour for my orderly?
His mother's come from Montreal to say goodbye to him.
A pass to leave the camp?
If he misses the draft, you'll get me shot.
She's lost two sons already.
He could see her and still be back in time for the draft.
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS
If I could scream louder than the bombs, that would fix it, then I'd be all right.
McKechnie, control yourself!
She sold it to some bugger called Evans.
If I thought it was William Evans of Castell Coch, I'd desert.
Don't talk that way, Morgan!
You'll get your leave soon.
Midnight before we can march them out.
It's not right to keep men hanging about.
They don't like it.
For heaven's sake, can't you set an example?
!
Lost the fuckers!
Not so much swear words, 0-5 Thomas.
Now that it's gone quiet, sir, we could send one of the runners to the sergeant-cook, tell him we're going to indent for the draft's suppers.
We can send the other one with the 128s to the quarter.
Send the runner to Depot and say that if candles are not provided for my orderly room by return of bearer,
I, Captain Tietjens, commanding Number XVI Casual Battalion, will bring the whole matter of supplies before Base HQ tonight.
Come on, you two, 0-9 Morgan to the cookhouse at the double.
Yes, Sarge.
Move yourselves!
What's it all about?
That's what I want to know!
You're no sort of soldier!
They say up at HQ that your wife's got hold of your friend, the general.
I know all about you.
You are very much mistaken if you think the general a friend of mine.
I haven't a friend in the world.
Sergeant-Major, make sure the Canadian troops don't leave their dug-outs till the All Clear!
HE PANTS AND WHIMPERS
Look, are you mad?
Stark staring?
If you let yourself go, you'll go further than you wish.
CANNONS FIRE
They must imagine that they've found the Hun again.
I must say, you look divine in your uniform.
Enchante, Madam.
I knew le brave Capitaine and his wife in London before the war, and didn't we see each other somewhere in France in 1912?
Here in Rouen, Madame.
Extraordinaire!
Does Christopher know I'm here?
No.
As soon as his draft leaves for the station, he'll have a few hours to come to the hotel.
Failing that, all my officers are under orders to attend my regular entente cordiale party tomorrow.
Why can't I see him now?
You may have noticed there's an air raid.
Isn't that normal where the war is?
The Captain's on duty and can't leave the camp.
I've booked you the room next to his.
There's a connecting door.
If Christopher is billeted at the hotel, why doesn't he sleep there?
He bunks down in the hut lines.
We're working under difficult circumstances.
Are we?
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS
Don't think I'm afraid of a bit of shrapnel.
They ought to let my orderly room have tin hats.
Headquarters are full of Huns doing the Huns' work.
Do you believe that tripe?
It's the English doing it.
NEARBY EXPLOSION
HE PANTS
Nearly got me, surely to goodness, but I did run, I did run!
All right, Thomas.
You can go into shelter with the Colonial troops, if you like.
No, I'll wait for my mate, 0-9 Morgan, Captain, sir.
I was in for the Foreign Office before all this began.
I suppose you speak seven languages.
Five.
And Latin and Greek, of course.
AEROPLANE APPROACHES Here it comes.
EXPLOSION
Here's another bloomin' casualty.
0-9 Morgan?
Oh, poor fucking 0-9 Morgan!
Surely to goodness, I didn't even recognise him!
Get out from under him, blast!
This ain't your job, sir.
You'll get all sticky.
Bugler, call two sanitary lance-corporals and four men!
Thomas.
0-9 Morgan was your mate?
He was a good pal.
Poor old bugger.
But you would not like, surely to goodness, to go to mess with your shoes all bloody.
If I'd given him leave, he would not be dead now.
No, surely he would not.
But it is all one.
Your honour is a good captain.
I know why Christopher doesn't sleep at the hotel.
He's got his mistress in Rouen, with the child.
How old is that child now?
Five?
No.
Of course not.
I know nothing about...
If you're talking about Miss Wannop, I'm not prepared to...
Even if his treatment of you has been...
Yes, Miss Wannop, Christopher's little suffragette.
SHE LAUGHS
I've nothing against them being pro-German,
I have German friends myself.
I say, steady on.
Yes, stop doing...what does your mother call it?
Shower-baths.
Is Sylvia pulling the strings of the shower-bath?
I say, I say, they've got the vote, though.
Saw it in the Sketch.
Will you vote, Mrs Tietjens?
I am not going to the hotel until I have seen Christopher with my own eyes.
There's a note from your foul General.
What does it say?
"For God's sake.
Can't you control your woman?"
Well, it didn't say it was private.
"You are more trouble to me than all the rest of my command put together."
Give me the rhyme-words for a sonnet.
That's the scheme of it.
I know what a damn sonnet is.
What's your game?
Give me 14 end-rhymes of a sonnet and I'll write a sonnet.
In two and a half minutes.
If you do, I'll translate it into Latin hexameters in under three minutes.
Get on with it then!
A, B, B, A. A, B...
Yes, what is it?
!
Good God, who are you?
Hotchkiss.
They said to find you.
Are you Captain Tietjens?
Don't you know how to address an officer?
Oh, yes, sorry.
Sir!
How long have you been in the army?
Two weeks.
There you are.
Two and a half minutes from now.
I have to go to Division horse line, and I seem to have been put in charge of taking your soldiers to some place called Bailleul...
Er, sir.
I shall endeavour to be, er... swift.
There's pink-eye running rife in all the service horses.
I've made a study of it.
I was sent for by the War Office.
I suppose Lord Beichen knew about me from my publications.
I'm a professor of equine studies.
Well, you're a stout fellow.
You should talk to Colonel Johnson.
You'll find him in 16 IBD Mess.
He'll be interested to meet you.
He's got a Hun horse captured on the Marne.
I ride Schomburg, myself.
Well, if you say so.
Many thanks.
Two minutes and 11 seconds.
I'm not starting till I've checked it's a sonnet.
GSO 2, sir.
You understand I've not read it.
I'll turn it into Latin in the time stipulated when I'm free.
KNOCK ON DOOR
The Canadian draft has not left yet!
We shall be strafed to hell.
We had to wangle everything, sir.
Desert boots, malaria powders, and then unwangle everything in a hurry when it was changed back to Bailleul.
It makes you wonder who's in charge, sir.
Ah, I see you're there, McKechnie.
Feeling well?
Feeling fit?
Look here, can you spare me 10 or 20 minutes?
It's not exactly a service matter.
You have to come down to the gate.
I hate to keep a woman waiting.
You mean, your...?
As it happens, I was spotted at the station and now my French lady-friend thinks I've got an English mistress.
Come on!
Are you dragging me there to deal with your absurd love-life?
Mine?
It's yours!
The poor woman is in a dreadful state of anxiety about you.
You haven't written to her once, she says.
You can't mean Miss Wannop?
Do you swear it?
Cross my heart, Miss.
I saw the captain with my own eyes this very morning, Miss!
I've been dreadfully worried about him.
You're welcome to wait in the guardroom, Miss.
No, it's perfectly all right.
I don't want to disturb Captain Tietjens when he's on duty, so long as he's all right.
You've all been absolutely sweet.
Oh, God!
Sylvia!
Dammit!
She's taken the car!
FAINT SOUND OF MARCHING
'Battalion, halt!
'
KNOCKS AT DOOR
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
Dash it!
BUGLE PLAYS
SOUND OF MARCHING
The draft's come back!
Oh, for the love of God!
By the way, did you give a pass to a Canadian?
Why?
He missed the curfew and the Redcaps nabbed him.
A few minutes before the curfew, you witnessed this prisoner saying goodbye to his mother, and the prisoner called you a damn brute for no reason, least of all because you made some discourteous comment about the old lady, is that right?
Yes, sir!
Then, having engaged the prisoner in conversation, by no means calling him "a blankety-blank colonial conscript", you discovered it was 11:02, so very properly charged him with being off-base and "conduct prejudicial".
Sir!
Mark the charge sheet as "case explained".
Dismiss!
Sir!
I am a hair's breadth from recommending a court of inquiry into your conduct.
If there is any, ANY repetition, by God, you will regret it.
Witnesses dismiss!
Provost-Marshall won't like it, sir.
General O'Hara loves his police like his own ewe-lambs.
The French railwaymen going on strike was a bit of luck for that Canadian lad, though, and lucky for me, too!
They heard a rumour the draft was for overseas.
If anyone needs me I'm going to ride Schomburg to the Hotel de la Poste to take my wife to the General Campion's tea party for the locals.
What the hell is the Colonel's horse doing in horse standings?
Don't you know Schomburg by now?
Yes, sir.
The 'oss has been put in 'oss-standings by orders of Lieutenant Hotchkiss.
Did you tell him that it was my orders that Schomburg be kept warm in the stables of the farm behind XVI IBD?
The lieutenant says 'osses have to be hardened, sir.
He also says how any departure from his orders would be visited by the extreme displeasure of Lord Beicham, KCVO, etc.
Well, listen carefully.
I am going to ride Schomberg over to the Hotel de la Poste, so saddle him up and meet me there, where you will take him back to the farm stables.
Make sure the windows are closed and stop up any chinks.
Give him oatmeal and water, hot as he can take it.
Finally, if Lieutenant Hotchkiss makes any comments, refer him to me.
Yes, sir.
How can you forget?
It's the very place where you left me and ruined my life!
So fair's fair.
Will you leave your door unlocked tonight?
There's Christopher!
I can see him in the glass.
He's seen me, too.
Good God, what are we going to do?
What'll HE do?
He'll smash me to pieces!
He wouldn't do anything to you.
A decent man doesn't hit girls.
Damn his chivalry!
So as not to embarrass me, he'll leave it to me.
Pardon.
I did not see madame.
Dites a ce monsieur que je suis occupee.
He looks ill.
What's he doing?
Giving me the social backing he thinks it's his duty as my husband to give.
He's Jesus Christ calling on the woman taken in adultery.
By all the saints, I'll make that wooden face wince yet.
I'll bring him to heel.
He's going upstairs.
He's probably gone to wreck your bedroom.
SHE SCOFFS
It's no use trying to awaken sentimental memories in me.
Does Christopher have a girl in this town?
No, he's too much of a stick.
He never even goes to Madame Suzette's.
Now, look here, will you let me come to your room tonight or not?
SHE LAUGHS
What's your game?
Hell and hounds, you can't have come here for HIM!
What's your game?
I'm going to tidy up before the General's tea party.
Wait for me.
I won't look like I can't find a man to escort me.
Campion will send me to the trenches if it looks like that.
Do you mean you wouldn't die for me, Potty?
Hang it all, what a cruel fiend you are.
I'm a woman desperately trying to get her husband back.
If Christopher would throw his handkerchief to me,
I would follow him round the world in my shift.
No, you wouldn't.
You're just wanting to make him squeal.
For that I'll leave my door unlocked, and be damned to you.
I don't say you'll get anything, or like what you get, but it's up to you.
Colonel, may I introduce you to Monsieur Dupree,
Regional Manager of the railway.
Railways?
Oh dear, oh dear.
What's going on with you chaps?
Look!
Hating the Hun has to come first, otherwise what's the giddy limit?
IN FRENCH:
Well, why do you treat her so damnably?
Sir, I don't have to discuss my private life..
I mean, for heaven's sake, Sylvia is the finest, the cleanest...
My dear!
Come to do your bit for the Grand Alliance?
You've already seen each other.
Yes, I made time to stop off at the hotel, sir.
Good.
Sir, if I may trouble you...
CONVERSATION INAUDIBLE
Well, I suppose I should thank you for being clear.
I don't understand you.
You didn't come back to the hotel to sleep.
You prefer all the fun of camping out with your Boy Scouts, do you?
Or did you spend the night with your mistress in her little nest in this frightful town?
I hardly got any sleep anywhere.
There was a railway strike.
I was landed with 3,000 men
I'd despatched to the front lines three hours earlier.
The French way of telling us that...
I'll scream if you don't stop.
Sorry.
I've forgotten how... ..how to be at peace, I suppose.
How is Michael?
He hasn't written to me.
He hardly knows you.
I came to settle things between us.
Will you come to the hotel tonight?
See?
Still sealed.
I'll send a driver for you in the morning, 0800.
Where am I going?
You're going to the station and think yourself lucky.
I will.
You've been sweet.
Hurry up, girls!
The bell's about to go.
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.
So does the new law mean you'll vote in the next election, Miss?
If I'm old enough.
I won't be 30 for...years!
Do you know Mrs Pankhurst, Miss?
She's your heroine, isn't she, Miss?
Well, I don't know, Annie.
I'm certainly not hers.
She said the other day that pacifism was a disease.
You wouldn't be a pacifist if your sweetheart was in the war, would you, Miss?
More than ever, of course.
Hurry up, the bell will go in a minute.
Have you got a sweetheart in the war, Miss?
I...
SHE SHRIEK
THE GIRLS LAUGH
MUSIC PLAYS
Captain Tietjens.
I got your report on the Canadian prisoner.
I must say, marking "case explained" on a charge sheet I signed myself is pretty strong.
If you would see fit, sir, to instruct your men not to call Colonial troops "damned conscripts..."
They are damned conscripts!
No, sir, not one of them.
Voluntarily enlisted.
Why, you insolent...!
You haven't heard the last of it!
Sir!
Christopher.
You look half dead.
Not far off it.
Have you had dinner?
Mmm.
I vamped an old fool of a general over a cutlet.
Then the air raid started and he went off to order everybody about.
General O'Hara.
Just had the pleasure.
What have you been doing?
Since I saw you?
Let me think.
Well, I have inspected 2,934 toothbrushes, most of which were clean, as the soldiers use their button-brushes for their teeth, to keep their toothbrushes clean for inspections.
So you betrayed me with a battalion!
You want a brandy?
I'll ring down.
Rum and hot water, if you would.
Of course.
Would you like to bathe?
I think I would, you know.
EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
It's sheer cheek putting a gun where people of quality might be wishing to sleep or converse.
They're not answering.
I'll try again.
I've brought a few letters for you.
Two from Mrs Wannop, who doesn't realise her daughter is your mistress, and one from your brother, Mark, which begins,
"Your bitch of a wife came to see me".
You should read that first, it's what I came to see you about.
Thank you.
The War Office brilliantly sent it on to the flat.
I've always understood that your idea of a marriage is that a husband and wife should be able to read each others' letters.
Of course.
I'll go...
EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
KNOCK AT DOOR
Monsieur.
Thank you.
What is it?
The draft has been brought forward.
I have to be at the camp by 4:30.
It's ridiculous that a man of your ability should be at the beck and call of a lot of gaga old fools like the one downstairs.
You shouldn't be here at all.
You're not fit.
Nobody posted to a Base Depot is fit.
That's why we're here.
I'm sorry you felt you had to come all this way to settle something
I'd be perfectly happy for you to have settled for yourself.
Groby is at your disposal if you want to live there with Michael, and, of course, with sufficient income to keep it up.
That means you don't intend to live there yourself.
Or you intend to get killed.
I should warn you that if you do get killed, I shall cut down the cedar.
It darkens the drawing room and the rooms above.
At last I changed the expression on your face.
I haven't the slightest intention of getting killed.
But it's not really up to me.
If I were to be sent back to my battalion...
Your brother refers to me as "that whore".
I haven't had a man, Christopher, for five years and more.
Not one.
I haven't let myself be kissed, or touched.
Not once, not since Perowne.
Potty Perowne!
Can you see how I must have been feeling, to go off with a fool like Potty?
I was not in my senses.
I broke under your forbearance, your permanent well-mannered forgiveness for my doing the dirty on you when I married you, not knowing...
Still don't know whether my child was yours or Gerald Drake's.
You forgave...without mercy.
To scream blue murder and throw me out would have been a kindness compared to five years under your roof, banished from your comfort.
SHE SCOFFS
Look what you've brought me to.
Throwing myself at you in my whore's trousseau!
My heat must have put a spell on all the sentries and ticket-inspectors... ..the musk of five years' wanting a man.
They must have smelled it.
Well...
..don't bother now.
I've changed my mind...
SHE LAUGHS
What's going on?
Get into bed.
I didn't see who it was.
Potty, I expect.
I'd forgotten about him!
Where is the hussy?
This is my wife's room.
I must ask you to leave this instant.
We'll see whether she's your wife or not!
Leave this room!
You assaulted an officer.
Are you drunk?
By God, I'll have you for that!
If you do not take General O'Hara away,
I will order you to arrest him for drunkenness.
Consider yourself under arrest!
Return to your quarters!
SHE LAUGHS
Well!
What a lark!
I am under arrest.
Why must you...?
Everywhere you go..
Oh, Potty asked for it.
I'm sure he did.
I asked for it, too.
Sylvia, I...
I'm so sorry.
SIREN WAILS
THE BAND PLAYS
'He said they could have as much coal as they wanted 'at 1914 pithead prices.'
I notice, Captain Tietjens, that you have no fire-extinguishers on your unit.
You're aware of the disastrous consequences that would follow a conflagration?
Yes, sir.
I was informed by Ordnance that there is no provision for fire-extinguishers for Dominion troops under an Imperial officer.
So, I applied, as advised, to a civilian firm...
I didn't ask for your memoirs.
Make a note, Levin.
Go and get your belt.
You can go round your cookhouses with me in a quarter of an hour.
You can tell your sergeant-cook.
You are aware, sir, that I am under arrest?
I gave you an order to perform a duty!
Sir!
You're doing splendidly.
You understand, you're released from arrest if you're given an order to perform a duty.
Of course I understand.
It's the last thing I want!
You can't refuse!
A court martial would be...
He'd be...
He thinks the world of...
What did Perowne say?
Perowne told General O'Hara...
Oh, I couldn't possibly!
He told O'Hara he went to Mrs Tietjens's room at her invitation?
It's impossible to believe anything against...
No, it's true.
He did.
But my wife was after fun, not adultery.
What has she told the General?
The general has not seen Mrs Tietjens.
He couldn't trust himself.
He said she'd twist him round her little finger.
He's learning.
He refused to let Perowne speak.
He said Perowne could choose between going up the line and being broke by his regiment.
My God.
He believes so absolutely in Mrs Tietjens.
It's broken the General's heart.
Something he heard from the Capitaine, the liaison officer...
You!
Put that down and tell Sergeant Case to report to my quarters at the double.
Yes, sir.
I'm supposed to ask you, was O'Hara drunk?
The General is anxious for your opinion.
He and O'Hara graduated together from Sandhurst.
Then, O'Hara was not drunk.
Campion will be immensely gratified.
As Provost-Marshal, he had the right to enter my room.
I pushed him out, which is an assault on a senior officer.
I'd be happy to plead guilty to that.
And to being drunk, of course.
An officer doesn't strike generals sober.
Your mania for taking the blows...
I'd rather be broken than have this hell raked up.
Case!
General Campion will be going round the cook-house in 15 minutes.
Right, sir!
Don't serve out white clothing.
The General likes to see them in white.
He won't know white clothing has been countermanded, sir.
If you do that, one of your cooks will tuck a dirty piece of clothing into a locker where the General will find it.
Yes, sir, there's always one piece of clothing left in a locker for GOCIC's inspection and General Campion will always find it.
I've seen him do it three times.
This time, the man it belongs to goes for a court martial.
Sir!
Sit down.
Captain Tietjens, I would be glad of your careful attention.
This afternoon, you will receive a movement order.
You are not to regard it as a disgrace.
It is a promotion.
I am requesting General Perry to give you the appointment of second-in-command of the VIth Battalion of his regiment.
What's your medical category?
Permanent base, sir.
My chest is rotten.
I should forget that if I were you.
The second-in-command of a battalion has nothing to do but sit about in armchairs waiting for the colonel to be killed.
If you say so, sir.
Who is your sergeant-cook?
Sergeant Case, sir.
Sergeant Case?
He was in the Drums when we were in Delhi.
He ought to be at least a Quartermaster now, but there was a woman he called his "sister".
He still sends money to his "sister", sir.
He went absent over her when he was a Colour-Sergeant.
Reduced to the ranks.
20 years ago, that must be.
God help you, Chrissie, there's nothing else I can do.
I can't put you on my staff.
You crossed General O'Hara in some row over his redcaps, never mind threatening him with arrest, so now you've a black spot against your name as regards access to Intelligence.
Next, dammit, the commander of the 9th French army is an intimate friend of mine, but in the face of your confidential report from your time in French liaison, that's blocked.
If you examine the detail of the report, sir, you will see the unfavourable inclusion is initialled by an Intelligence Officer, Major Drake, who...doesn't like me.
What difference does that make?
Not many officers DO like you.
Are you aware that there's one hell of a strafe put in against you by a RASC Second-Lieutenant called Hotchkiss?
That was about Schomburg, sir.
I'd rather die than subject any horse for which I'm responsible to the damnable theories of Lieutenant Hotchkiss!
It looks as if you WILL die on that account.
There was a request from your brother, Mark, through Room G14-R of the War Office that you be given command of the horse lines of the 19th Division, but the 19th Division's attached to Fourth Army now,
and it's Fourth Army horses that Hotchkiss is to play with.
How can I send you there to be under his orders?
Yes, sir.
You cannot.
I can send you home, in disgrace, or I can send you to your battalion.
You're finished here.
I cannot have men commanded by an officer with a private life as incomprehensible and embarrassing as yours.
Yes, sir.
I took that woman to be a saint!
I swear she IS a saint!
There is no accusation against Mrs Tietjens, sir!
By God, there is!
You let me think...
I remember every word of our conversation in Rye, letting me think Sylvia had gone abroad to look after her mother.
Sylvia and Perowne were seen together by Capitaine Thurston at the Hotel de la Poste in 1912!
Can you beat it?
Were they?
Well, what is one to do when a woman is unfaithful?
Sir.
Divorce the harlot!
Or live with her, like a man!
What sort of a fellow wouldn't see that?
But there is...or used to be... ..among families of position...
..a certain...
Well?
Call it, parade!
Was there?
Well, there are no more parades for that regiment.
It held out to the last man, but you were him.
MARCHING BAND STRIKES UP
Open that, will you, my man?
Yes, sir.
I hope you had a good visit, Miss.
Very good, thank you.
Did the draft get off, do you know?
It did, Miss.
Captain Tietjens' draft, at five o'clock.
You know the army, then, Miss?
The lingo?
I should say so!
I'm the Captain's lady.
What do you think it's like, when you know this is it?
Death!
You are surely not in love with Christopher?
You mustn't be.
Every word Christopher Tietjens and I ever said to each other was a declaration of love.
GUNFIRE You feel no pain.
But if my husband thinks he can throw me over for that scrub-faced ladies' champion of the regular bowel movement...
He's the only man who perhaps wouldn't.

Edward's command is in Rouen, or somewhere in France.
Bertram tells me that you've lost a window during the last raid.
- Are you going to the Satwell Squash?
- I thought I might.
It's also to tell the French best shut up about the single command.
No.
No votes for you, I'm afraid.
It's going to be married women over 30.
And it's a serious problem on the whole front.
Horses decimated by pink-eye.
You should put that fellow Hotchkiss in charge of the horse lines.
The warhorse needs to be hardened.
Mollycoddling will ruin him.
Hotchkiss is the man you need in France.
Hotchkiss?
You'll find him in Horse World advertising embrocation.
Get hold of Hotchkiss.
The Come?
will back you
The Comets first edition, my lord.
General.
Sylvia wants a pass to the Infantry Base Depot in Rouen.
She wants to see her husband.
That's strictly out of bounds to wives, I'm afraid, Mrs Tietjens.
Mmm.
And what about mistresses?
I bet there's a few of those behind the lines.
I think it's jolly unfair.
Here you are, Bertram.
Might as well spoil your dinner as your breakfast.
The Come?
exposes the scandal of our out-of-touch command in Flanders
I'm sure it does.
But it's your own fault for building up General Perry in the first place.
Wait until the German spring offensive gives him a bloody nose, Beichen.
And then we can bring him home.
Is that why you're keeping the Commander-in-Chief short of troops, Bertram?
Hmm?
If we gave Perry the men, he'd lose half of them in a week.
If I had my way, we'd let the French go to blazes.
Quite.
There won't always be a European war but there'll always be an Empire.
What about Salonika, Bertram?
Salonika!
Nathan, isn't that where your people originally...
- Not originally, my dear!
I say, it would be nice if we could forget the war, just for five minutes.
I give up.
- Move to adjourn.
- Come on, my dear.
- Mother.
- I'm just finishing.
It'll be the finish of you if you don't...
Mother!
I'm writing to Christopher.
At least he isn't in the casualty lists.
I always look.
Well, of course he's not.
He's not in the fighting.
His brother got him into a job looking after horses.
There's the all-clear.
Sylvia,
I need you to rally round.
Johnnie's behaving appallingly.
Oh, what, you mean, about your divertissement?
It's not a divertissement.
I'm bolting.
Oh, Bobbie.
You mean, you and...
- But he's...
- It's not his fault he's a Jew.
Fat, I was going to say.
It's his fault he's fat.
He wants me to marry me.
So, I need you to get Johnnie over the hump.
No. just take him out and about.
He's a good old sausage.
I want to do my best for him.
That's all very well, but I've a mind to visit Christopher in France.
I've written to General Campion.
I wish Tietjens would write to his damned wife.
Or, at any rate, stop her from writing to me.
It's not my job to reassure the wives of officers their husbands are still alive, damn it.
It's bad enough having to write to them when they're not.
There's a movement order come in for Captain Tietjens, sir, from the War Office, Room G14R.
It was misrouted and has only now caught up, I'm afraid.
Movement?
To where?
Divisional horse transport.
Well, you can tell Room G14R, whoever the hell they are, that I'm not parting with Captain Tietjens!
He's the only officer on the base who can get his draft into marching order on time!
Not that he isn't a confounded nuisance.
I could give them Captain McKechnie when he's back from divorce leave.
He's sane enough for horses, isn't he?
Captain McKechnie has returned from leave, sir, but he omitted to get divorced.
How dare he not get divorced?
He told me his wife was cohabiting with a...an Egyptian, wasn't it?
- Some sort of dago, anyway.
- No, sir, an Egyptologist.
They've agreed to share her.
That dirty dog!
I'll strip him of his commission!
A damn fine officer when he isn't going mad.
And a Vice-Chancellor's Latin prize man as well.
Another brilliant fellow.
Like Tietjens.
That's a thought.
They can be brilliant together.
Does "subter" take the accusative or the ablative?
Both.
Accusative when it's under as a motion and ablative when it's under as a state.
"...
Pictured at Lady Hazlitt's Ball with the Honorable Johnnie Pelham"?
"Mrs Christopher Tietjens, whose husband is in hospital at the Front."
Sylvia must have told them that herself.
The paper wouldn't put the knife into her.
Women like Sylvia are the jam on their bread and butter.
But why would she do that?
To let him know she's on the warpath.
Well, don't worry about Christopher.
It was only pneumonia, and not at the Front.
He's a hundred miles from the nearest German trench.
His job is kitting out fresh troops on their way to the fighting.
Nothing to worry about except air raids.
But are they dropping bombs on him?
My dear, they're dropping bombs on you and yet, here you are.
But I thought Christopher was looking after horses somewhere safe.
That's the War Office for you.
But an Infantry Base Depot is a soft posting so long as you're not sent back to your battalion.
Anything but the trenches!
Hmm.
General Campion is attaching a Captain McKechnie to my unit for rations and discipline.
What's that about?
I can't say as I can say, sir.
"A Vice-Chancellor's Latin prize man."
Well, I'm sure that will come in useful.
Fire extinguishers.
We indented the Royal Engineers.
Sir.
The Royal Engineers say that as per Army Directive 1BDR3417, for fire extinguishers we should apply to Ordnance.
Ordnance said there's no provision for fire extinguishers for Canadian units passing through an Infantry Base Depot.
And that the proper course would be to obtain them from a civilian firm at home and charge them against barrack damages.
- Yes, sir.
- I have here a letter from the leading British manufacturer of fire extinguishers, telling me that they been forbidden by the War Office to sell fire extinguishers to anyone but the War Office, direct.
Thank God we have a navy.
Yes, sir.
Cardiff Police Office.
0 Nine Morgan is outside, sir.
- Application for compassionate leave.
- Hmm.
His wife has sold their laundry business to someone, name of Evans.
- Now she can't get the money.
- True, in as far as it goes.
The police say his wife is now living with Mr Evans, a prize-fighter, and that we should keep 0 Nine Morgan here if we know what's good for him.
- In he comes.
- Sir!
0 Nine Morgan, present yourself to the officer at the double!
Well, now, 0 Nine Morgan.
Because there are things that I have to discuss with Christopher.
And what is the point in being permanent secretary of the Department of Transport if you can't transport me, if I put it like that, between London and Rouen?
This is family business, Mark.
I have to go to the office.
As far as I'm concerned,
Groby is Christopher's to do what he likes with.
So if you can produce his written authorization,
I have no objection to your living at Groby.
But of course, if what you say is true, he might want to live at Groby with Miss Wannop.
Well, that is why I'm asking you now...
I'm afraid you overestimate my authority, which does not extend to France.
And in any case, does not exceed General Campion's in matters that concern the army.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Utter nonsense.
I'll buy a ticket at the station.
See if they can stop me.
Never known a woman like her.
She says she's going to come and see for herself.
On no account, on no account is Mrs Tietjens to be allowed within 50 miles of Rouen.
Understood?
Inform the War Office, the Provost-Marshall, the port authorities and the rail authorities.
I will not have skirts around my HQ!
More importantly,
General Perry is now on the telephone twice a day.
He has troops who were due to be relieved weeks ago.
And I have troops waiting for Ordnance to supply them with eyebrow tweezers, while our political masters keep changing their minds whether to send them up the line or ship them to Salonika or Mesopotamia or Timbuktu!
But I have one draft of Canadian troops ready to go to the Front today.
That's the draft prepared by Captain Tietjens' unit.
Capitaine Thurston, do I have the trains or do I not?
You will have the trains, sir, and the cooperation of the French railway, going east to the Front, certainly.
I want these troops on their way to Flanders before London can blink!
- Oui', man General.
- Champagne at two o'clock!
Which train, madam?
Oh, I don't know.
Dover, I expect.
Sylvia!
Potty!
What are you doing here?
- King's messenger.
- King's messenger?
Yeah, glorified postman, really, but frightfully important.
Locked carriages, private cabins, saluted through the gate.
Oh!
- Where are you off to?
- Well, where are you?
This way, sir.
- Gosh, I've missed you, Sylvia.
Thank you.
Captain.
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Everyone got a glass?
Splendid.
Well, then.
It's been our pleasure to fit out you and your men for the task ahead.
Somebody deal with that telephone.
It is a great task and thanks to Captain Tietjens and his unit, you Canadians go to the Front in good order.
You will be relieving soldiers who've been in the trenches for many weeks.
Believe me, 3,000 fresh troops under keen young officers is just what the Hun doesn't want to face in our part of the line.
Discipline and training will keep you alive, remember it.
I'll be at the railhead to see you off.
Form up at 2000, air raids permitting.
That's in the event of there being no further orders.
Thank you!
Captain Tietjens, come with me.
The draft has been countermanded.
I'll find out what's going on, but you had better be ready to get the men back under canvas tonight.
- Yes, sir.
May I ask...
- No, you may not.
I can't tell you where overseas these new orders will be taking you but believe me, the war where you're going is every bit as important as the war in Flanders and you will get your chance at the Hun.
I daresay you're disappointed.
Stop that telephone.
But I know that you Canadians will enjoy the challenge and some rather warmer weather.
There, that's a clue for you.
You will form your men up at 1700 hours for the march to the railhead.
We'll try to send you off by 1900, before the expected air raid.
That's all, gentlemen.
Good luck!
It was Major Perowne, sir, calling for a driver.
- He's at the station.
- Good.
And...
And he's got Mrs Tietjens with him.
I will break you for this!
I will smash you!
General, how lovely!
We've all been missing you.
Tietjens.
May I ask a small favour for my orderly?
His mother's come from Montreal to say goodbye to him.
A pass to leave the camp?
If he misses the draft, he'll get me shot.
She's lost two sons already.
He could see her and still be back in time for the draft.
If I could scream louder than the bombs, I would fix it, then I'd be all right.
McKechnie, control yourself.
She sold it to some bugger called Evans.
If I thought it was William Evans from Castell Coch, I'd desert.
Don't talk that way, Morgan, you'll get your leave soon.
Midnight before we can march them out.
It's not right to keep the men hanging about like that.
They don't like it.
For heaven's sake, can't you set an example?
Lost the fuckers!
Not so much swear words, 0 Five Thomas.
Now that it's gone quiet, sir, we could send one of the runners to the sergeant-cook, tell him we're going to indent for the draft's suppers.
We could send the other one with the 128s to the Quarter.
Send the runner to Depot, and say that if candles are not provided for my orderly room by return of bearer,
I, Captain Tietjens, commanding No.
XVI Casual Battalion, will bring the whole matter of supplies before Base HQ tonight.
Come on, you two, 0 Nine Morgan to the cook house, at the double.
- Yes, Sergeant.
- What's it all about?
That's what I want to know.
You're no sort of soldier.
They say up at HQ that your wife's got hold of your friend the General.
I know all about you.
You are very much mistaken if you think the General is a friend of mine.
I haven't a friend in the world.
Sergeant Major, make sure all the Canadian troops don't leave their dugouts till the all-clear.
Look, are you mad?
Stark staring?
If you let yourself go, you'll go further than you wish.
They must imagine that they've found the Hun again.
I must say you look divine in your uniform.
Enrhante, Madame.
I knew le brave Capitaine and his wife in London before the war.
And didn't we see each other somewhere in...in France in 1912?
Here, in Rouen, Madame.
Extraordinaire.
Does Christopher know I'm here?
No.
As soon as his draft leaves for the station, he'll have a few hours to come to the hotel.
Failing that, all my officers are under orders to attend my regular entente cordiale party tomorrow.
Why can't I see him now?
You may have noticed there's an air raid.
Isn't that normal?
This is where the war is.
The Captain's on duty and can't leave the camp.
I've booked you the room next to his.
There's a connecting door.
If Christopher is billeted at the hotel, why doesn't he sleep there?
He bunks down in the hut lines.
We're all working under difficult circumstances.
Are we?
Don't think I'm afraid of a bit of shrapnel.
They ought to let my orderly room have tin hats.
Headquarters are full of Huns doing the Huns' work.
Do you believe that tripe?
It's the English doing it.
Nearly got me, surely to goodness.
But I did run.
I did run.
All right, Thomas, you can go into shelter with the Colonial troops, if you like.
No, no.
I'll wait for my mate 0 Nine Morgan, Captain, sir.
I was in for the Foreign Office before all this began.
I suppose you speak seven languages.
Five.
And Latin and Greek, of course.
Here it comes.
Here's another bloomin' casualty.
0 Nine Morgan?
Oh!
Poor fucking 0 Nine Morgan, surely to goodness...
Get out from under him...
This ain't your job, sir!
You'll get all sticky.
Bugler, call two sanitary lance-corporals and four men!
Thomas... 0 Nine Morgan was your mate.
He was a good pal.
Poor old bugger.
But you would not like, surely to goodness, to go to Mess with your boots so bloody.
If I'd given him leave, he would not be dead now.
Ah, no.
Surely, he would not.
It is all one.
Your honor is a good captain.
I know why Christopher doesn't sleep at the hotel.
He's got his mistress in Rouen, with the child.
How old is that child now?
Five?
No.
Of course not.
I know nothing about it.
If you're talking about Miss Wannop, I'm not prepared to...
- Even if his treatment of you has...
- Yes, Miss Wannop.
Christopher's little suffragette.
Oh, I've nothing against them being pro-German.
I have German friends myself.
Oh, I say, steady on.
Yes, stop doing...
What does your mother call it?
Shower baths.
Is Sylvia pulling the strings of the shower-bath?
I say, they've got the vote, though.
Saw it in the Sketch.
Will you vote, Mrs Tietjens?
I am not going to the hotel until I've seen Christopher with my own eyes.
There's a note from your foul General.
What does it say?
"For God's sake, can't you control your woman?"
Well, it didn't say it was private.
"You're more trouble to me than all the rest of my command put together."
Give me the rhyme-words for a sonnet.
That's the scheme of it.
I know what a damn sonnet is.
What's your game?
Give me 14 end-rhymes of a sonnet and I'll write a sonnet.
In two and a half minutes.
If you do, I'll translate it into Latin hexameters in under three minutes.
Well, get on with it, then.
A, B, B, A, A, B...
Yes, what is it?
Good God.
Who are you?
Hotchkiss.
They said to find you.
Are you Captain Tietjens?
Don't you know how to address an officer?
Oh, yes, sorry.
- Sir.
- How long have you been in the army?
- Two weeks.
- There you are.
Two and a half minutes from now.
I have to go to the Division horse line and I seem to have been put in charge of taking your soldiers to some place called Bailleul... uh, sir.
I shall endeavor to be, uh, swift.
There's pink-eye running rife through all the service horses.
I've made a study of it.
I was sent for by the War Office.
I suppose Lord Beichen knew about me from my publications.
I'm a professor of equine studies.
Well, you're a stout fellow.
You should talk to Colonel Johnson
You'll find him in XVI IBD Mess.
He'll be interested to meet you.
He's got a Hun horse captured on the Marne,
I ride Schomburg myself.
Well, if you say so.
Many thanks.
Two minutes and 11 seconds.
I'm not starting till I've checked it's a sonnet.
GSO 2, sir.
You understand I've not read it?
I'll turn it into Latin in the time stipulated when I'm free.
The Canadian draft has not left yet.
We shall be strafed to hell.
We had to wangle everything, sir.
Desert boots, malaria powders...
Then unwangle everything to normal in a hurry when it was changed back to Bailleul.
It makes you wonder who's in charge, sir.
Ah.
I see you're there, McKechnie.
Feeling well?
Feeling...fit?
Look here.
Can you spare me 10 or 20 minutes?
It's not exactly a service matter.
You have to come down to the gate.
I hate to keep a woman waiting.
You mean, your...
As it happens, I was spotted at the station.
And now my French lady friend thinks I've got an English mistress.
Come on!
Are you dragging me down there to deal with your absurd love life?
Mine?
It's yours!
The poor woman is in a dreadful state of anxiety about you.
You haven't written to her once, she says.
You can't mean Miss...
Wannop?
Do you swear it?
Cross my heart, miss.
I saw the captain with my own eyes this very morning, miss.
I've been dreadfully worried about him.
You're welcome to wait in the guard room, miss.
No, it's perfectly all right.
I don't want to disturb Captain Tietjens when he's on duty.
So long as he's all right.
You've all been absolutely sweet.
Oh, God.
Sylvia.
Damn it!
She's taken the car.
Battalion, halt!
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
About turn!
Dash it!
- The draft's come back.
- Oh, for the love of God!
By the way, did you give a pass to a Canadian?
Why?
He missed the curfew and redcaps nabbed him.
So, a few minutes before curfew you witnessed this prisoner saying goodbye to his mother.
And the prisoner called you a "damn brute" for no reason, least of all because you made some discourteous comment about the old lady.
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir!
And, then having engaged the prisoner in conversation, by no means calling him a blankety-blank Colonial conscript, you discovered it was two minutes past 11, so very properly charged him with being off base and conduct prejudicial.
Sir!
Mark the charge sheet as "case explained".
- Dismissed.
- Sir!
I am a hair's breadth from recommending a court of inquiry into your conduct.
If there is any, any repetition, by God, you will regret it.
Witnesses dismissed!
Provost-Marshall won't like it, sir.
General O'Hara loves his police like his own ewe lambs.
The French railwaymen going on strike was a bit of luck for that Canadian lad there.
And lucky for me, too.
They heard a rumor the draft was for overseas.
If anyone needs me, I'm going to ride Schomburg to the Hotel DE la Poste to take my wife to General Campion's tea party for the locals.
What the hell is the Colonel's horse doing in horse-standings?
- Don't you know Schomburg by now?
- Yes, sir.
The horse's been put in horse-standings by orders of Lieutenant Hotchkiss.
Didn't you tell him it was my orders that Schomburg should be kept warm in the stables of the farm behind XVI IBD?
The lieutenant says horses have to be hardened, sir.
He also says there are any departure from his orders will be visited by the extreme displeasure of Lord Beichen, KCVO, etcetera.
Listen carefully.
I'm here to ride Schomburg over to the Hotel DE la Poste, so saddle him up and meet me there, where you will take him back to the farm stables.
Make sure the windows are closed and stop up any chinks.
Give him oatmeal and water, hot as he can take it.
Finally, if Lieutenant Hotchkiss makes any comments, refer him to me!
Yes, sir.
How can you forget?
It's the very place where you left me and ruined my life.
So fair's fair.
Will you leave your door unlocked tonight?
There's Christopher.
I can see him in the glass.
- He's seen me, too.
- Good God, what are we going to do?
What' LL he d 0?
He'll smash me to pieces.
Oh, he wouldn't do anything to a girl like you.
A decent man doesn't hit girls.
Damn his chivalry.
So as not to embarrass me, he'll leave it to me.
Pardon, I did not see Madame.
- He looks ill.
- What's he doing?
Giving me the social backing he thinks it's his duty as my husband to give.
He's Jesus Christ calling on the woman taken in adultery.
By all the saints, I'll make that wooden face wince yet.
I'll bring him to heel.
He's going upstairs.
He's probably gone to wreck your bedroom.
It's no use trying to awaken sentimental memories in me.
Does Christopher have a girl in this town?
No, he's too much of a stick.
He never even goes to Madame Suzette's.
Now, look here.
Will you let me come to your room tonight or not?
What's your game?
Hell and hounds, you can't have come here for him.
What's your game?
I'm going to tidy up before the General's tea party.
Wait for me.
I'm not going to look as if I couldn't find a man to escort me.
Campion will send me to the trenches if it looks like that.
Oh, you mean you wouldn't die for me, Potty?
Hang it all, what a cruel fiend you are.
I'm a woman desperately trying to get her husband back.
If Christopher would throw his handkerchief to me,
I would follow him round the world in my shift.
No, you wouldn't.
You're just wanting to make him squeal.
For that I'll leave my door unlocked and be damned to you!
I don't say you'll get anything or like what you get, but it's up to you.
Ah, Colonel, may I introduce you to Monsieur Dupuis, regional manager of the railway?
Railways?
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
What's going on with you chaps?
Look, hating the Hun has to come first, otherwise...
Well, it's the giddy limit!
- Well, why do you treat her so damnably?
- Sir, I don't have to discuss my...
I mean, for heaven's sake.
Sylvia is the finest, the cleanest...
My dear.
Come to do your bid for the Grand Alliance?
You've already seen each other?
Yes, I made time to stop off at the hotel...
- Good.
- Sir, if I may trouble you.
Um...
Well, I suppose I should thank you for being clear.
I don't understand you.
You didn't come back to the hotel to sleep.
You prefer all the fun of camping out with your Boy Scouts, do you?
Or did you spend the night with your mistress in her little nest in this frightful town?
I hardly got any sleep anywhere.
There was a railway strike.
I was landed with 3,000 men I dispatched to the front lines three hours earlier.
- The French way of telling us that...
- I'll scream if you don't stop.
Sorry.
I've forgotten how... how to be at peace, I suppose.
How is Michael?
He hasn't written to me.
He hardly knows you.
I came to settle things between us.
Will you come to the hotel tonight?
See?
Still sealed.
I'll send a driver for you in the morning, 0800.
Where am I going?
You're going to the station.
And think yourself lucky.
I will.
You've been sweet.
Hurry up, girls, the bell's about to go!
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.
So, does the new law mean you'll vote in the next election, Miss?
If I'm old enough.
I won't be 30 for years.
- Do you know Mrs Pankhurst, Miss?
- She's your heroine, isn't she, Miss?
Well, I don't know, Annie.
I'm certainly not hers.
She said the other day that pacifism was a disease.
But you wouldn't be a pacifist if your sweetheart was in the war, would you, Miss?
More than ever, of course.
Hurry up, the bell will go in a minute.
Have you got a sweetheart in the war, Miss?
I...
Captain Tietjens.
I got your report on the Canadian prisoner.
I must say, marking "case explained"
on a charge sheet I signed myself is pretty strong.
If you would see fit, sir, to instruct your men not to call Colonial troops "damned conscripts".
- They are damned conscripts.
- No, sir!
Not one of them.
Voluntarily enlisted.
Why, you insolent!
You haven't heard the last of it.
Sir!
Christopher.
You look half dead.
Not far off it.
Have you had dinner?
Mmm.
Ivamped an old fool of a general over a cutlet.
Then the air raid started and he went off to order everybody about.
General O'Hara. just had the pleasure.
What have you been doing?
Since I saw you?
Let me think.
Well, I have inspected 2,934 toothbrushes, most of which were clean because the soldiers use their button-brushes for their teeth, to keep their toothbrushes clean for inspections.
So you betrayed me with a battalion.
You'll want a brandy.
I'll ring down.
Rum and hot water, if you would.
Of course.
Would you like to bathe?
I think I would, you know.
Sheer cheek, putting a gun where people of quality might be wishing to sleep or converse.
They're not answering.
I'll try again.
I've brought a few letters for you.
Two from Mrs Wannop, who doesn't seem to realise that her daughter is your mistress, and one from your brother Mark, which begins, "Your bitch of a wife came to see me."
You should read that one first, it's what I came to see you about.
Thank you.
The War Office brilliantly sent it on to the flat.
I've always understood that your idea of marriage is that husband and wife should be able to read each other's letters.
Of course.
I'll go...
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.
What is it?
The draft's been brought forward.
I have to be at the camp by 4.30.
It's ridiculous that a man of your abilities should be at the beck and call of a lot of gaga old fools like the ones downstairs.
You shouldn't be here at all.
You're not fit.
Nobody posted to a Base Depot is fit.
That's why we're here.
I'm sorry that you felt you had to come all this way to settle something
I'd be perfectly happy for you to have settled for yourself.
Groby is at your disposal, if you want to live there with Michael.
And of course with sufficient income to keep it up.
Well, that means you don't intend to live there yourself.
Or you intend to get killed.
I should warn you that if you do get killed, I shall cut down the cedar.
It darkens the drawing room and the rooms above.
At last, I changed the expression on your face.
I haven't the slightest intention of getting killed.
But it's not really up to me.
If I were to be sent back to my battalion...
Your brother refers to me as "that whore".
I haven't had a man, Christopher, for five years and more.
Not one.
I haven't let myself be kissed or touched.
Not once, not since Perowne.
Potty Perowne!
Can you see how I must have been feeling, to go off with a fool like Potty?
I was not in my senses.
I broke under your forbearance, your permanent, well-mannered forgiveness for my doing the dirty on you when I married you, not knowing, still don't know whether my child was yours or Gerald Drake's.
You forgave, without mercy.
To scream blue murder and throw me out would have been a kindness compared to five years under your roof, banished from your comfort.
Look what you've brought me to.
Throwing myself at you in my whore's trousseau.
My heat must have put a spell on all the sentries and ticket-inspectors.
The musk of five years wanting a man,
they must have smelt it.
Well,
don't bother now.
I've changed my mind.
What's going on?
Get into bed.
I didn't see who it was.
- Potty, I expect.
I forgot about him.
Where is the hussy?
This is my wife's room.
I must ask you to leave this instant.
We'll see whether she's your wife or not!
- Leave this room!
- You assaulted an officer!
Are you drunk?
By God, I'll have you for that!
If you do not take General O'Hara away,
I will order you to arrest him for drunkenness.
Consider yourself under arrest!
Return to your quarters!
Well...
- what a lark.
- I am under arrest.
Why must you, everywhere you go...
Oh, Potty asked for it.
I'm sure he did.
I asked for it, too.
Sylvia, I...
I'm so sorry.
He says they could have as much coal as they wanted at 1914 pithead prices.
I notice, Captain Tietjens, you have no fire extinguishers on your unit.
You're aware of the disastrous consequences that would follow a conflagration?
Yes, sir.
I was informed by Ordnance that there is no provision for fire extinguishers for Dominion troops under an Imperial officer.
So, I applied, as advised, to a civilian firm...
I didn't ask for your memoirs.
Make a note, Levin.
Go and get your belt.
You can go round your cook houses with me in a quarter of an hour.
You can tell your sergeant-cook.
You are aware, sir, that I am under arrest?
I gave you an order to perform a duty.
Sir!
You're doing splendidly.
You understand you're released from arrest if you're given an order to perform a duty?
Of course I understand.
It's the last thing I want.
You can't refuse.
A court martial would be...
He'd be...
He thinks the world of...
What did Perowne say?
Perowne told General O'Hara...
Oh, I couldn't possibly...
He told O'Hara he went to Mrs Tietjens' room at her invitation?
- It's impossible to believe anything...
- No, it's true.
He did.
But my wife was after fun, not adultery.
What has she told the General?
The General has not seen Mrs Tietjens.
He couldn't trust himself.
He said she'd twist him round her little finger.
- He's learning.
- He refused to let Perowne speak.
He said Perowne could choose between going up the line and being broke by his regiment.
My God.
He believes so absolutely in Mrs Tietjens.
It's broken the General's heart.
Something he heard from the Capitaine, the liaison officer.
You!
Put that down.
Tell Sergeant Case to report to my quarters at the double.
Yes, sir.
I'm supposed to ask you, was O'Hara drunk?
The General is anxious for your opinion.
He and O'Hara graduated together from Sandhurst.
Then...
O'Hara was not drunk.
Campion will be immensely gratified.
As Provost-Marshall, he had a right to enter my room.
I pushed him out, which is an assault on a senior officer.
I'd be happy to plead guilty to that.
And to being drunk, of course.
An officer doesn't strike generals sober.
Your mania for taking the blows...
I'd rather be broken than have this hell raked up.
Case.
General Campion will be going round the cook house in 15 minutes.
- Right, sir.
- Don't serve out white clothing.
The General likes to see them in white.
He won't know white clothing has been countermanded, sir.
If you do that, one of your cooks will tuck some dirty piece of clothing into a locker where the General will find it.
Yes, sir, there is always one piece of clothing left in a locker for a GOCIC's inspection, sir, and General Campion will always find it.
I've seen him do it three times.
This time, the man it belongs to goes for a court martial.
Sir!
Sit down.
Captain Tietjens, I would be glad of your careful attention.
This afternoon you will receive a movement order.
You are not to regard it as a disgrace.
It is a promotion.
I'm requesting General Perry to give you the appointment of second-in-command of the Vith Battalion of his regiment.
What is your medical category?
Permanent base, sir.
My chest is rotten.
I should forget that if I were you.
The second-in-command of a battalion has nothing to do but sit about in armchairs, waiting for the colonel to be killed.
- If you say so, sir.
- Who is your sergeant-cook?
Sergeant Case, sir.
Sergeant Case?
He was in the drums when we were in Delhi.
He ought to be at least a quartermaster by now, but there was a woman he called his sister.
He still sends money to his sister, sir.
He went absent over her when he was a color-sergeant.
Reduced to the ranks.
Twenty years ago, that must be.
God help you, Chrissie, there's nothing else I can do.
I can't put you on my staff.
You crossed General O'Hara in some row over his redcaps, never mind threatening him with arrest, so now you've a black spot against your name as regards access to intelligence.
Next, damn it, the commander of the 9th French army is an intimate friend of mine.
But in the face of your confidential report from your time in French liaison, that's blocked.
Examine the detail of the report, sir, you will see the unfavorable inclusion is initialled by an Intelligence Officer, Major Drake, who doesn't like me.
What difference does that make?
Not many officers do like you.
Are you aware there's one hell of a strafe put in against you by a RASC second-lieutenant called Hotchkiss?
That was about Schomburg, sir.
I'd rather die than subject any horse for which I am responsible to the damnable theories of Lieutenant Hotchkiss!
It looks as if you will die on that account.
There was a request from your brother Mark through Room G14R of the War Office, that you be given the command of the horse lines of 19th Division.
But the 19th Division is attached to the Fourth Army now, and it's Fourth Army horses that Hotchkiss is to play with.
How can I send you there to be under his orders?
No, sir.
You cannot.
I can send you home in disgrace or I can send you to your battalion.
You're finished here.
I cannot have men commanded by an officer with a private life as incomprehensible and embarrassing as yours.
Yes, sir.
I took that woman to be a saint.
I swear, she is a saint.
There's no accusation against Mrs Tietjens, sir!
By God, there is!
You let me think...
I remember every word of our conversation in Rye, letting me think Sylvia had gone abroad to look after her mother.
Sylvia and Perowne were seen together by Capitaine Thurston at the Hotel DE la Poste in 1912.
Can you beat it?
Were they?
Well... what is one to do when a woman is unfaithful, sir?
Divorce the harlot!
Or live with her like a man!
What sort of a fellow wouldn't see that?
But there is, or used to be, among families of position,
a certain...
Well?
Call it...parade.
Was there?
Well, there are no more parades for that regiment.
It held out to the last man but you were him.
Open that, will you, my man?
Yes, sir!
I hope you had a good visit, miss.
Very good, thank you.
- Did the draft get off, do you know?
- It did, miss.
Captain Tietjens' draft, at five o'clock.
You know the army, then, miss, the lingo?
I should say so.
I'm the Captain's lady.
If the woman that's come between you and Sylvia is our little suffragette...
I want you to swear on your St Anthony that you won't leave me.
I'll do no such thing.
Will you be my mistress tonight?
Yes!
My husband is going out to war tomorrow.
But I'd keep off the grass.
You cannot conceive of the explosives the armies throw at each other.
Had the stuffing knocked out of me.
GUNSHOT I won't take his money.
You usually forgive a fellow who shoots himself.
I don't.
Couldn't you bring yourself to seduce that little kitchen maid?
There'd have been a chance for us.
What I stand for is gone.
And yet I may not say this is an accursed war.
This programme contains some strong language.
This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting
Edward's command is at Rouen, or "somewhere in France", we're supposed to say.
Bertram tells me you lost a window during the last raid?
Are you going to the Sackvilles'?
I thought so.
..it's also to tell the French, best shut up about the single command.
No, no votes for you I'm afraid.
It's going to be for married women over 30.
It's a serious problem on the whole front.
Horses decimated by pink-eye.
You should put that fellow, Hotchkiss, in charge of the horse lines.
The warhorse needs to be hardened.
Mollycoddling will ruin him.
Hotchkiss is the man you need in France.
Hotchkiss?
You'll find him in Horse World, advertising embrocation.
"Get hold of Hotchkiss!"
The Comet will back you.
The Comet's first edition, My Lord.
General, Sylvia wants a pass to the Infantry Base Depot in Rouen.
She wants to see her husband.
Strictly out of bounds to wives, I'm afraid, Mrs Tietjens.
Hmm, and what about mistresses?
I bet there's a few of those behind the lines.
I think it's jolly unfair.
Here you are, Bertram.
Might as well spoil your dinner as your breakfast!
The Comet exposes the scandal of our out-of-touch command in Flanders.
I'm sure it does, but it's your own fault for building up General Perry in the first place.
Wait until the German spring offensive gives him a bloody nose, Beichen, and then we can bring him home.
Is that why you're keeping the Commander-in-Chief short of troops, Bertram?
If we gave Perry the men, he'd lose half of them in a week.
If I had my way, we'd let the French go to blazes.
Quite.
There won't always be a European war, but there'll always be an Empire.
What about Salonika, Bertram?
Salonika?
Nathan, isn't that where your people originally...
Not originally, my dear!
THEY ALL LAUGH POLITELY
I say, it would be nice if we could forget the war just for five minutes...
TRUMPETS AND CANNON FIRE
I give up!
Move to adjourn.
Come on, my dear.
GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSION
NEARBY EXPLOSION
Mother!
I'm just finishing.
It'll be the finish of you if you don't...
EXPLOSION Mother!
I'm writing to Christopher.
At least HE isn't in the casualty lists.
I always look.
Of course he's not.
He's not in the fighting.
His brother got him into a job looking after horses!
EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE
TRUMPETS PLAY
There's the all-clear.
Sylvia, I need you to rally round.
Johnny's behaving appallingly.
Oh, what, you mean about your divertissement?
It's not a divertissement.
I'm bolting!
Oh, Bobbie!
You mean you and...?
But he's...
It's not his fault he's a Jew.
Fat, I was going to say.
It's his fault he's fat.
He wants to marry me.
So I need you to get Johnny over the hump.
No, just take him out and about.
He's a good old sausage.
I want to do my best for him.
That's all very well, but I've a mind to visit Christopher in France.
I've written to General Campion.
I wish Tietjens would write to his damned wife, or, at any rate, stop her from writing to me.
It's not my job to reassure the wives of officers their husbands are still alive, damn it.
It's bad enough having to write to them when they're not.
There's a movement order come in for Captain Tietjens, sir, from the War Office, Room G14-R.
It was mis-routed and has only now caught up, I'm afraid.
Movement?
To where?
Divisional horse transport.
Well, you can tell Room G14-R, whoever the hell they are, that I'm not parting with Captain Tietjens!
He's the only officer on the base who can get his draft into marching order on time.
Not that he isn't a confounded nuisance.
I could give them Captain McKechnie when he's back from divorce leave.
He's sane enough for horses, isn't he?
Captain McKechnie HAS returned from leave, sir, but he omitted to get divorced.
How DARE he not get divorced!
He told me his wife was co-habiting with an...
Egyptian, wasn't it?
Some sort of dago, anyway.
No, sir, an EGYPTOLOGIST.
They've agreed to share her.
That dirty dog!
I'll strip him of his commission!
A damn fine officer when he isn't going mad, and a Vice Chancellor's Latin prize man, as well.
Another brilliant fellow, like Tietjens.
That's a thought.
They can be brilliant together.
BELL RINGS
Does "subter" take the accusative or the ablative?
Both.
Accusative when it's "under" as a motion, and ablative when it's "under" as a state.
"... pictured at Lady Hazlitt's Ball
"with the Honourable Johnnie Pelham..."
"..
Mrs Christopher Tietjens,
"whose husband is in hospital at the Front"!
Sylvia must have told them that herself.
HE SCOFFS
The paper wouldn't put the knife into her.
Women like Sylvia are the jam on their bread and butter.
But why would she do that?
To let him know she's on the warpath.
Well, don't worry about Christopher, it was only pneumonia, and not at the Front.
He's 100 miles from the nearest German trench.
His job is kitting out fresh troops on their way to the fighting.
Nothing to worry about but air raids.
But are they dropping bombs on him?
My dear, they're dropping bombs on you, and yet here you are.
But I thought Christopher was looking after horses somewhere safe.
That's the War Office for you.
But an Infantry Base Depot is a soft posting, so long as you're not sent back to your battalion.
Anything but the trenches!
THEY ROAR AND SCREAM
Move it, move it, move it!
Shoulder...arms!
Present...arms!
Shoulder...arms!
Quick...march!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right...
Hmm.
General Campion is attaching Captain McKechnie to my unit for rations and discipline.
What's that about?
I can't say as I can say, sir.
"A Vice-Chancellor's Latin prize man".
Well, I'm sure that will come in useful(!
)
fire-extinguishers.
We indented the Royal Engineers.
Sir.
The Royal Engineers said, as per army directive 1BDR 3417, for fire-extinguishers, we should apply to Ordnance.
Ordnance said there's no provision for them for Canadian units passing through an Infantry Base Depot, and that the proper course would be to obtain them from a civilian firm and charge them against barrack damages.
Yes, sir.
I have here a letter from the leading British manufacturer of fire-extinguishers, telling me that they have been forbidden by the War Office to sell fire-extinguishers to anyone but to the War Office direct.
Thank God we have a navy.
Yes, sir.
Cardiff Police Office... 0-9 Morgan is outside, sir.
Application for compassionate leave.
His wife has sold their laundry business to someone, name of Evans.
Now she can't get the money.
True in as far as it goes.
The police say his wife is now living with Mr Evans, a prize-fighter, and we should keep 0-9 Morgan here if we know what's good for him.
In he comes.
Sir.
0-9 Morgan, present yourself to the officer, at the double!
Well now, 0-9 Morgan... ..because there are things I have to discuss with Christopher, and what is the point in being permanent secretary of the Department of Transport if you can't transport me -
I put it like that - between London and Rouen?
This is family business, Mark.
I have to go to the office.
SHE SIGHS
As far as I'm concerned,
Groby is Christopher's to do what he likes with.
So if you can produce his written authorisation,
I have no objection to your living at Groby.
But, of course, if what you say is true, he might want to live at Groby with Miss Wannop.
Well, that's why I'm asking you now...
I'm afraid you overestimate my authority, which does not extend to France, and in any case, does not exceed General Campion's in matters that concern the army.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Utter nonsense!
I'll buy a ticket at the station!
See if they can stop me.
Never known a woman like her.
She says she's going to come and see for herself!
On no account...
On NO account is Mrs Tietjens to be allowed within 50 miles of Rouen.
Understood?
Inform the War Office, the Provost Marshal, the port authorities and the rail authorities.
I will not have skirts around my HQ!
More importantly, General Perry is now on the telephone twice a day.
He has troops who were due to be relieved weeks ago, and I have troops waiting for Ordnance to supply them with eyebrow tweezers while our political masters keep changing their minds whether to send them up the line or ship them to Salonika or Mesopotamia or Timbuktu!
But I have one draft of Canadian troops ready to go to the Front today.
That's the draft prepared by Captain Tietjens's unit.
Captain Thurston, do I have the trains or do I not?
You have the trains, sir, and the co-operation of the French railway, going east to the Front, certainly.
I want these troops on their way to Flanders before London can blink!
Oui, mon general.
Champagne at two o'clock!
Which train, Madam?
Oh, I don't know.
Dover, I expect.
Sylvia!
Potty!
What are you doing here?
King's Messenger!
King's Messenger?
Yes.
Glorified postman, really, but frightfully important!
Locked carriages, private cabins, saluted through the gate.
Oh!
Where are you off to?
Where are you?
This way, sir.
Gosh, I've missed you, Sylvia.
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
Thank you.
Captain.
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Everyone got a glass?
Splendid.
PHONE RINGS
Well, then, it's been our pleasure to fit out you and your men for the task ahead.
Somebody deal with that telephone.
It's a great task, and thanks to Captain Tietjens and his unit, you Canadians go to the front in good order.
You will be relieving soldiers who've been in the trenches for many weeks.
Believe me, 3,000 fresh troops under keen, young officers is just what the Hun doesn't want to face in our part of the line.
Discipline and training will keep you alive.
Remember it.
I'll be at the railhead to see you off.
Form-up at 2000, air raids permitting.
That's in the event of there being no further orders.
Thank you!
Captain Tietjens, come with me!
The draft has been countermanded.
I'll find out what's going on, but you'd better be ready to get the men back under canvas tonight.
Yes, sir.
May I ask...?
No, you may not.
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
I can't tell you where overseas these new orders will be taking you, but, believe me, the war where you're going is every bit as important as the war in Flanders and you WILL get your chance at the Hun.
PHONE RINGS
I dare say you're disappointed.
Stop that telephone.
But I know that you Canadians will enjoy the challenge and some rather warmer weather.
That's, er, a clue for you.
You will form your men up at 1700 hours for the march to the railhead.
We'll try to send you off by 1900, before the expected air raid.
That's all, gentlemen.
Good luck!
It was Major Perowne, sir, calling for a driver.
He's at the station.
Good.
And...
And he's got Mrs Tietjens with him.
WHISPERS:
I will break you for this.
I will smash you.
General!
How lovely!
We've all been missing you.
Tietjens.
May I ask a small favour for my orderly?
His mother's come from Montreal to say goodbye to him.
A pass to leave the camp?
If he misses the draft, you'll get me shot.
She's lost two sons already.
He could see her and still be back in time for the draft.
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS
If I could scream louder than the bombs, that would fix it, then I'd be all right.
McKechnie, control yourself!
She sold it to some bugger called Evans.
If I thought it was William Evans of Castell Coch, I'd desert.
Don't talk that way, Morgan!
You'll get your leave soon.
Midnight before we can march them out.
It's not right to keep men hanging about.
They don't like it.
For heaven's sake, can't you set an example?
!
Lost the fuckers!
Not so much swear words, 0-5 Thomas.
Now that it's gone quiet, sir, we could send one of the runners to the sergeant-cook, tell him we're going to indent for the draft's suppers.
We can send the other one with the 128s to the quarter.
Send the runner to Depot and say that if candles are not provided for my orderly room by return of bearer,
I, Captain Tietjens, commanding Number XVI Casual Battalion, will bring the whole matter of supplies before Base HQ tonight.
Come on, you two, 0-9 Morgan to the cookhouse at the double.
Yes, Sarge.
Move yourselves!
What's it all about?
That's what I want to know!
You're no sort of soldier!
They say up at HQ that your wife's got hold of your friend, the general.
I know all about you.
You are very much mistaken if you think the general a friend of mine.
I haven't a friend in the world.
Sergeant-Major, make sure the Canadian troops don't leave their dug-outs till the All Clear!
HE PANTS AND WHIMPERS
Look, are you mad?
Stark staring?
If you let yourself go, you'll go further than you wish.
CANNONS FIRE
They must imagine that they've found the Hun again.
I must say, you look divine in your uniform.
Enchante, Madam.
I knew le brave Capitaine and his wife in London before the war, and didn't we see each other somewhere in France in 1912?
Here in Rouen, Madame.
Extraordinaire!
Does Christopher know I'm here?
No.
As soon as his draft leaves for the station, he'll have a few hours to come to the hotel.
Failing that, all my officers are under orders to attend my regular entente cordiale party tomorrow.
Why can't I see him now?
You may have noticed there's an air raid.
Isn't that normal where the war is?
The Captain's on duty and can't leave the camp.
I've booked you the room next to his.
There's a connecting door.
If Christopher is billeted at the hotel, why doesn't he sleep there?
He bunks down in the hut lines.
We're working under difficult circumstances.
Are we?
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS
Don't think I'm afraid of a bit of shrapnel.
They ought to let my orderly room have tin hats.
Headquarters are full of Huns doing the Huns' work.
Do you believe that tripe?
It's the English doing it.
NEARBY EXPLOSION
HE PANTS
Nearly got me, surely to goodness, but I did run, I did run!
All right, Thomas.
You can go into shelter with the Colonial troops, if you like.
No, I'll wait for my mate, 0-9 Morgan, Captain, sir.
I was in for the Foreign Office before all this began.
I suppose you speak seven languages.
Five.
And Latin and Greek, of course.
AEROPLANE APPROACHES Here it comes.
EXPLOSION
Here's another bloomin' casualty.
0-9 Morgan?
Oh, poor fucking 0-9 Morgan!
Surely to goodness, I didn't even recognise him!
Get out from under him, blast!
This ain't your job, sir.
You'll get all sticky.
Bugler, call two sanitary lance-corporals and four men!
Thomas.
0-9 Morgan was your mate?
He was a good pal.
Poor old bugger.
But you would not like, surely to goodness, to go to mess with your shoes all bloody.
If I'd given him leave, he would not be dead now.
No, surely he would not.
But it is all one.
Your honour is a good captain.
I know why Christopher doesn't sleep at the hotel.
He's got his mistress in Rouen, with the child.
How old is that child now?
Five?
No.
Of course not.
I know nothing about...
If you're talking about Miss Wannop, I'm not prepared to...
Even if his treatment of you has been...
Yes, Miss Wannop, Christopher's little suffragette.
SHE LAUGHS
I've nothing against them being pro-German,
I have German friends myself.
I say, steady on.
Yes, stop doing...what does your mother call it?
Shower-baths.
Is Sylvia pulling the strings of the shower-bath?
I say, I say, they've got the vote, though.
Saw it in the Sketch.
Will you vote, Mrs Tietjens?
I am not going to the hotel until I have seen Christopher with my own eyes.
Ogl¹daj legalnie, polecaj i zarabiaj – Vodeon.pl
There's a note from your foul General.
What does it say?
"For God's sake.
Can't you control your woman?"
Well, it didn't say it was private.
"You are more trouble to me than all the rest of my command put together."
Give me the rhyme-words for a sonnet.
That's the scheme of it.
I know what a damn sonnet is.
What's your game?
Give me 14 end-rhymes of a sonnet and I'll write a sonnet.
In two and a half minutes.
If you do, I'll translate it into Latin hexameters in under three minutes.
Get on with it then!
A, B, B, A. A, B...
Yes, what is it?
!
Good God, who are you?
Hotchkiss.
They said to find you.
Are you Captain Tietjens?
Don't you know how to address an officer?
Oh, yes, sorry.
Sir!
How long have you been in the army?
Two weeks.
There you are.
Two and a half minutes from now.
I have to go to Division horse line, and I seem to have been put in charge of taking your soldiers to some place called Bailleul...
Er, sir.
I shall endeavour to be, er... swift.
There's pink-eye running rife in all the service horses.
I've made a study of it.
I was sent for by the War Office.
I suppose Lord Beichen knew about me from my publications.
I'm a professor of equine studies.
Well, you're a stout fellow.
You should talk to Colonel Johnson.
You'll find him in 16 IBD Mess.
He'll be interested to meet you.
He's got a Hun horse captured on the Marne.
I ride Schomburg, myself.
Well, if you say so.
Many thanks.
Two minutes and 11 seconds.
I'm not starting till I've checked it's a sonnet.
GSO 2, sir.
You understand I've not read it.
I'll turn it into Latin in the time stipulated when I'm free.
KNOCK ON DOOR
The Canadian draft has not left yet!
We shall be strafed to hell.
We had to wangle everything, sir.
Desert boots, malaria powders, and then unwangle everything in a hurry when it was changed back to Bailleul.
It makes you wonder who's in charge, sir.
Ah, I see you're there, McKechnie.
Feeling well?
Feeling fit?
Look here, can you spare me 10 or 20 minutes?
It's not exactly a service matter.
You have to come down to the gate.
I hate to keep a woman waiting.
You mean, your...?
As it happens, I was spotted at the station and now my French lady-friend thinks I've got an English mistress.
Come on!
Are you dragging me there to deal with your absurd love-life?
Mine?
It's yours!
The poor woman is in a dreadful state of anxiety about you.
You haven't written to her once, she says.
You can't mean Miss Wannop?
Do you swear it?
Cross my heart, Miss.
I saw the captain with my own eyes this very morning, Miss!
I've been dreadfully worried about him.
You're welcome to wait in the guardroom, Miss.
No, it's perfectly all right.
I don't want to disturb Captain Tietjens when he's on duty, so long as he's all right.
You've all been absolutely sweet.
Oh, God!
Sylvia!
Dammit!
She's taken the car!

BUGLE PLAYS
SOUND OF MARCHING
The draft's come back!
Oh, for the love of God!
By the way, did you give a pass to a Canadian?
Why?
He missed the curfew and the Redcaps nabbed him.
A few minutes before the curfew, you witnessed this prisoner saying goodbye to his mother, and the prisoner called you a damn brute for no reason, least of all because you made some discourteous comment about the old lady, is that right?
Yes, sir!
Then, having engaged the prisoner in conversation, by no means calling him "a blankety-blank colonial conscript", you discovered it was 11:02, so very properly charged him with being off-base and "conduct prejudicial".
Sir!
Mark the charge sheet as "case explained".
Dismiss!
Sir!
I am a hair's breadth from recommending a court of inquiry into your conduct.
If there is any, ANY repetition, by God, you will regret it.
Witnesses dismiss!
Provost-Marshall won't like it, sir.
General O'Hara loves his police like his own ewe-lambs.
The French railwaymen going on strike was a bit of luck for that Canadian lad, though, and lucky for me, too!
They heard a rumour the draft was for overseas.
If anyone needs me I'm going to ride Schomburg to the Hotel de la Poste to take my wife to the General Campion's tea party for the locals.
What the hell is the Colonel's horse doing in horse standings?
Don't you know Schomburg by now?
Yes, sir.
The 'oss has been put in 'oss-standings by orders of Lieutenant Hotchkiss.
Did you tell him that it was my orders that Schomburg be kept warm in the stables of the farm behind XVI IBD?
The lieutenant says 'osses have to be hardened, sir.
He also says how any departure from his orders would be visited by the extreme displeasure of Lord Beicham, KCVO, etc.
Well, listen carefully.
I am going to ride Schomberg over to the Hotel de la Poste, so saddle him up and meet me there, where you will take him back to the farm stables.
Make sure the windows are closed and stop up any chinks.
Give him oatmeal and water, hot as he can take it.
Finally, if Lieutenant Hotchkiss makes any comments, refer him to me.
Yes, sir.
How can you forget?
It's the very place where you left me and ruined my life!
So fair's fair.
Will you leave your door unlocked tonight?
There's Christopher!
I can see him in the glass.
He's seen me, too.
Good God, what are we going to do?
What'll HE do?
He'll smash me to pieces!
He wouldn't do anything to you.
A decent man doesn't hit girls.
Damn his chivalry!
So as not to embarrass me, he'll leave it to me.
Pardon.
I did not see madame.
Dites a ce monsieur que je suis occupee.
He looks ill.
What's he doing?
Giving me the social backing he thinks it's his duty as my husband to give.
He's Jesus Christ calling on the woman taken in adultery.
By all the saints, I'll make that wooden face wince yet.
I'll bring him to heel.
He's going upstairs.
He's probably gone to wreck your bedroom.
SHE SCOFFS
It's no use trying to awaken sentimental memories in me.
Does Christopher have a girl in this town?
No, he's too much of a stick.
He never even goes to Madame Suzette's.
Now, look here, will you let me come to your room tonight or not?
SHE LAUGHS
What's your game?
Hell and hounds, you can't have come here for HIM!
What's your game?
I'm going to tidy up before the General's tea party.
Wait for me.
I won't look like I can't find a man to escort me.
Campion will send me to the trenches if it looks like that.
Do you mean you wouldn't die for me, Potty?
Hang it all, what a cruel fiend you are.
I'm a woman desperately trying to get her husband back.
If Christopher would throw his handkerchief to me,
I would follow him round the world in my shift.
No, you wouldn't.
You're just wanting to make him squeal.
For that I'll leave my door unlocked, and be damned to you.
I don't say you'll get anything, or like what you get, but it's up to you.
Colonel, may I introduce you to Monsieur Dupree,
Regional Manager of the railway.
Railways?
Oh dear, oh dear.
What's going on with you chaps?
Look!
Hating the Hun has to come first, otherwise what's the giddy limit?
IN FRENCH:
Well, why do you treat her so damnably?
Sir, I don't have to discuss my private life..
I mean, for heaven's sake, Sylvia is the finest, the cleanest...
My dear!
Come to do your bit for the Grand Alliance?
You've already seen each other.
Yes, I made time to stop off at the hotel, sir.
Good.
Sir, if I may trouble you...
CONVERSATION INAUDIBLE
Well, I suppose I should thank you for being clear.
I don't understand you.
You didn't come back to the hotel to sleep.
You prefer all the fun of camping out with your Boy Scouts, do you?
Or did you spend the night with your mistress in her little nest in this frightful town?
I hardly got any sleep anywhere.
There was a railway strike.
I was landed with 3,000 men
I'd despatched to the front lines three hours earlier.
The French way of telling us that...
I'll scream if you don't stop.
Sorry.
I've forgotten how... ..how to be at peace, I suppose.
How is Michael?
He hasn't written to me.
He hardly knows you.
I came to settle things between us.
Will you come to the hotel tonight?
See?
Still sealed.
I'll send a driver for you in the morning, 0800.
Where am I going?
You're going to the station and think yourself lucky.
I will.
You've been sweet.
Hurry up, girls!
The bell's about to go.
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.
So does the new law mean you'll vote in the next election, Miss?
If I'm old enough.
I won't be 30 for...years!
Do you know Mrs Pankhurst, Miss?
She's your heroine, isn't she, Miss?
Well, I don't know, Annie.
I'm certainly not hers.
She said the other day that pacifism was a disease.
You wouldn't be a pacifist if your sweetheart was in the war, would you, Miss?
More than ever, of course.
Hurry up, the bell will go in a minute.
Have you got a sweetheart in the war, Miss?
I...
SHE SHRIEK
THE GIRLS LAUGH
MUSIC PLAYS
Captain Tietjens.
I got your report on the Canadian prisoner.
I must say, marking "case explained" on a charge sheet I signed myself is pretty strong.
If you would see fit, sir, to instruct your men not to call Colonial troops "damned conscripts..."
They are damned conscripts!
No, sir, not one of them.
Voluntarily enlisted.
Why, you insolent...!
You haven't heard the last of it!
Sir!
Christopher.
You look half dead.
Not far off it.
Have you had dinner?
Mmm.
I vamped an old fool of a general over a cutlet.
Then the air raid started and he went off to order everybody about.
General O'Hara.
Just had the pleasure.
What have you been doing?
Since I saw you?
Let me think.
Well, I have inspected 2,934 toothbrushes, most of which were clean, as the soldiers use their button-brushes for their teeth, to keep their toothbrushes clean for inspections.
So you betrayed me with a battalion!
You want a brandy?
I'll ring down.
Rum and hot water, if you would.
Of course.
Would you like to bathe?
I think I would, you know.
EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
It's sheer cheek putting a gun where people of quality might be wishing to sleep or converse.
They're not answering.
I'll try again.
I've brought a few letters for you.
Two from Mrs Wannop, who doesn't realise her daughter is your mistress, and one from your brother, Mark, which begins,
"Your bitch of a wife came to see me".
You should read that first, it's what I came to see you about.
Thank you.
The War Office brilliantly sent it on to the flat.
I've always understood that your idea of a marriage is that a husband and wife should be able to read each others' letters.
Of course.
I'll go...
EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
KNOCK AT DOOR
Monsieur.
Thank you.
What is it?
The draft has been brought forward.
I have to be at the camp by 4:30.
It's ridiculous that a man of your ability should be at the beck and call of a lot of gaga old fools like the one downstairs.
You shouldn't be here at all.
You're not fit.
Nobody posted to a Base Depot is fit.
That's why we're here.
I'm sorry you felt you had to come all this way to settle something
I'd be perfectly happy for you to have settled for yourself.
Groby is at your disposal if you want to live there with Michael, and, of course, with sufficient income to keep it up.
That means you don't intend to live there yourself.
Or you intend to get killed.
I should warn you that if you do get killed, I shall cut down the cedar.
It darkens the drawing room and the rooms above.
At last I changed the expression on your face.
I haven't the slightest intention of getting killed.
But it's not really up to me.
If I were to be sent back to my battalion...
Your brother refers to me as "that whore".
I haven't had a man, Christopher, for five years and more.
Not one.
I haven't let myself be kissed, or touched.
Not once, not since Perowne.
Potty Perowne!
Can you see how I must have been feeling, to go off with a fool like Potty?
I was not in my senses.
I broke under your forbearance, your permanent well-mannered forgiveness for my doing the dirty on you when I married you, not knowing...
Still don't know whether my child was yours or Gerald Drake's.
You forgave...without mercy.
To scream blue murder and throw me out would have been a kindness compared to five years under your roof, banished from your comfort.
SHE SCOFFS
Look what you've brought me to.
Throwing myself at you in my whore's trousseau!
My heat must have put a spell on all the sentries and ticket-inspectors... ..the musk of five years' wanting a man.
They must have smelled it.
Well...
..don't bother now.
I've changed my mind...
SHE LAUGHS
What's going on?
Get into bed.
I didn't see who it was.
Potty, I expect.
I'd forgotten about him!
Where is the hussy?
This is my wife's room.
I must ask you to leave this instant.
We'll see whether she's your wife or not!
Leave this room!
You assaulted an officer.
Are you drunk?
By God, I'll have you for that!
If you do not take General O'Hara away,
I will order you to arrest him for drunkenness.
Consider yourself under arrest!
Return to your quarters!
SHE LAUGHS
Well!
What a lark!
I am under arrest.
Why must you...?
Everywhere you go..
Oh, Potty asked for it.
I'm sure he did.
I asked for it, too.
Sylvia, I...
I'm so sorry.
SIREN WAILS
THE BAND PLAYS
'He said they could have as much coal as they wanted 'at 1914 pithead prices.'
I notice, Captain Tietjens, that you have no fire-extinguishers on your unit.
You're aware of the disastrous consequences that would follow a conflagration?
Yes, sir.
I was informed by Ordnance that there is no provision for fire-extinguishers for Dominion troops under an Imperial officer.
So, I applied, as advised, to a civilian firm...
I didn't ask for your memoirs.
Make a note, Levin.
Go and get your belt.
You can go round your cookhouses with me in a quarter of an hour.
You can tell your sergeant-cook.
You are aware, sir, that I am under arrest?
I gave you an order to perform a duty!
Sir!
You're doing splendidly.
You understand, you're released from arrest if you're given an order to perform a duty.
Of course I understand.
It's the last thing I want!
You can't refuse!
A court martial would be...
He'd be...
He thinks the world of...
What did Perowne say?
Perowne told General O'Hara...
Oh, I couldn't possibly!
He told O'Hara he went to Mrs Tietjens's room at her invitation?
It's impossible to believe anything against...
No, it's true.
He did.
But my wife was after fun, not adultery.
What has she told the General?
The general has not seen Mrs Tietjens.
He couldn't trust himself.
He said she'd twist him round her little finger.
He's learning.
He refused to let Perowne speak.
He said Perowne could choose between going up the line and being broke by his regiment.
My God.
He believes so absolutely in Mrs Tietjens.
It's broken the General's heart.
Something he heard from the Capitaine, the liaison officer...
You!
Put that down and tell Sergeant Case to report to my quarters at the double.
Yes, sir.
I'm supposed to ask you, was O'Hara drunk?
The General is anxious for your opinion.
He and O'Hara graduated together from Sandhurst.
Then, O'Hara was not drunk.
Campion will be immensely gratified.
As Provost-Marshal, he had the right to enter my room.
I pushed him out, which is an assault on a senior officer.
I'd be happy to plead guilty to that.
And to being drunk, of course.
An officer doesn't strike generals sober.
Your mania for taking the blows...
I'd rather be broken than have this hell raked up.
Case!
General Campion will be going round the cook-house in 15 minutes.
Right, sir!
Don't serve out white clothing.
The General likes to see them in white.
He won't know white clothing has been countermanded, sir.
If you do that, one of your cooks will tuck a dirty piece of clothing into a locker where the General will find it.
Yes, sir, there's always one piece of clothing left in a locker for GOCIC's inspection and General Campion will always find it.
I've seen him do it three times.
This time, the man it belongs to goes for a court martial.
Sir!
Sit down.
Captain Tietjens, I would be glad of your careful attention.
This afternoon, you will receive a movement order.
You are not to regard it as a disgrace.
It is a promotion.
I am requesting General Perry to give you the appointment of second-in-command of the VIth Battalion of his regiment.
What's your medical category?
Permanent base, sir.
My chest is rotten.
I should forget that if I were you.
The second-in-command of a battalion has nothing to do but sit about in armchairs waiting for the colonel to be killed.
If you say so, sir.
Who is your sergeant-cook?
Sergeant Case, sir.
Sergeant Case?
He was in the Drums when we were in Delhi.
He ought to be at least a Quartermaster now, but there was a woman he called his "sister".
He still sends money to his "sister", sir.
He went absent over her when he was a Colour-Sergeant.
Reduced to the ranks.
20 years ago, that must be.
God help you, Chrissie, there's nothing else I can do.
I can't put you on my staff.
You crossed General O'Hara in some row over his redcaps, never mind threatening him with arrest, so now you've a black spot against your name as regards access to Intelligence.
Next, dammit, the commander of the 9th French army is an intimate friend of mine, but in the face of your confidential report from your time in French liaison, that's blocked.
If you examine the detail of the report, sir, you will see the unfavourable inclusion is initialled by an Intelligence Officer, Major Drake, who...doesn't like me.
What difference does that make?
Not many officers DO like you.
Are you aware that there's one hell of a strafe put in against you by a RASC Second-Lieutenant called Hotchkiss?
That was about Schomburg, sir.
I'd rather die than subject any horse for which I'm responsible to the damnable theories of Lieutenant Hotchkiss!
It looks as if you WILL die on that account.
There was a request from your brother, Mark, through Room G14-R of the War Office that you be given command of the horse lines of the 19th Division, but the 19th Division's attached to Fourth Army now,
and it's Fourth Army horses that Hotchkiss is to play with.
How can I send you there to be under his orders?
Yes, sir.
You cannot.
I can send you home, in disgrace, or I can send you to your battalion.
You're finished here.
I cannot have men commanded by an officer with a private life as incomprehensible and embarrassing as yours.
Yes, sir.
I took that woman to be a saint!
I swear she IS a saint!
There is no accusation against Mrs Tietjens, sir!
By God, there is!
You let me think...
I remember every word of our conversation in Rye, letting me think Sylvia had gone abroad to look after her mother.
Sylvia and Perowne were seen together by Capitaine Thurston at the Hotel de la Poste in 1912!
Can you beat it?
Were they?
Well, what is one to do when a woman is unfaithful?
Sir.
Divorce the harlot!
Or live with her, like a man!
What sort of a fellow wouldn't see that?
But there is...or used to be... ..among families of position...
..a certain...
Well?
Call it, parade!
Was there?
Well, there are no more parades for that regiment.
It held out to the last man, but you were him.
MARCHING BAND STRIKES UP
Open that, will you, my man?
Yes, sir.
I hope you had a good visit, Miss.
Very good, thank you.
Did the draft get off, do you know?
It did, Miss.
Captain Tietjens' draft, at five o'clock.
You know the army, then, Miss?
The lingo?
I should say so!
I'm the Captain's lady.
What do you think it's like, when you know this is it?
Death!
You are surely not in love with Christopher?
You mustn't be.
Every word Christopher Tietjens and I ever said to each other was a declaration of love.
GUNFIRE You feel no pain.
But if my husband thinks he can throw me over for that scrub-faced ladies' champion of the regular bowel movement...
He's the only man who perhaps wouldn't.
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd
There's some talk against your boy.
If the woman that's come between you and Sylvia is our little suffragette...
I want you to swear on your St Anthony that you won't leave me.
I'll do no such thing.
Will you be my mistress tonight?
Yes!
My husband is going out to war tomorrow.
But I'd keep off the grass.
You cannot conceive of the explosives the armies throw at each other.
Had the stuffing knocked out of me.
GUNSHOT I won't take his money.
You usually forgive a fellow who shoots himself.
I don't.
Couldn't you bring yourself to seduce that little kitchen maid?
There'd have been a chance for us.
What I stand for is gone.
And yet I may not say this is an accursed war.
This programme contains some strong language.
This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting
Edward's command is at Rouen, or "somewhere in France", we're supposed to say.
Bertram tells me you lost a window during the last raid?
Are you going to the Sackvilles'?
I thought so.
.. it's also to tell the French, best shut up about the single command.
No, no votes for you I'm afraid.
It's going to be for married women over 30.
It's a serious problem on the whole front.
Horses decimated by pink-eye.
You should put that fellow, Hotchkiss, in charge of the horse lines.
The warhorse needs to be hardened.
Mollycoddling will ruin him.
Hotchkiss is the man you need in France.
Hotchkiss?
You'll find him in Horse World, advertising embrocation.
"Get hold of Hotchkiss!"
The Comet will back you.
The Comet's first edition, My Lord.
General, Sylvia wants a pass to the Infantry Base Depot in Rouen.
She wants to see her husband.
Strictly out of bounds to wives, I'm afraid, Mrs Tietjens.
Hmm, and what about mistresses?
I bet there's a few of those behind the lines.
I think it's jolly unfair.
Here you are, Bertram.
Might as well spoil your dinner as your breakfast!
The Comet exposes the scandal of our out-of-touch command in Flanders.
I'm sure it does, but it's your own fault for building up General Perry in the first place.
Wait until the German spring offensive gives him a bloody nose, Beichen, and then we can bring him home.
Is that why you're keeping the Commander-in-Chief short of troops, Bertram?
If we gave Perry the men, he'd lose half of them in a week.
If I had my way, we'd let the French go to blazes.
Quite.
There won't always be a European war, but there'll always be an Empire.
What about Salonika, Bertram?
Salonika?
Nathan, isn't that where your people originally...
Not originally, my dear!
THEY ALL LAUGH POLITELY
I say, it would be nice if we could forget the war just for five minutes...
TRUMPETS AND CANNON FIRE
I give up!
Move to adjourn.
Come on, my dear.
GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSION
NEARBY EXPLOSION
Mother!
I'm just finishing.
It'll be the finish of you if you don't...
EXPLOSION Mother!
I'm writing to Christopher.
At least HE isn't in the casualty lists.
I always look.
Of course he's not.
He's not in the fighting.
His brother got him into a job looking after horses!
EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE
TRUMPETS PLAY
There's the all-clear.
Sylvia, I need you to rally round.
Johnny's behaving appallingly.
Oh, what, you mean about your divertissement?
It's not a divertissement.
I'm bolting!
Oh, Bobbie!
You mean you and...?
But he's...
It's not his fault he's a Jew.
Fat, I was going to say.
It's his fault he's fat.
He wants to marry me.
So I need you to get Johnny over the hump.
No, just take him out and about.
He's a good old sausage.
I want to do my best for him.
That's all very well, but I've a mind to visit Christopher in France.
I've written to General Campion.
I wish Tietjens would write to his damned wife, or, at any rate, stop her from writing to me.
It's not my job to reassure the wives of officers their husbands are still alive, damn it.
It's bad enough having to write to them when they're not.
There's a movement order come in for Captain Tietjens, sir, from the War Office, Room G14-R.
It was mis-routed and has only now caught up, I'm afraid.
Movement?
To where?
Divisional horse transport.
Well, you can tell Room G14-R, whoever the hell they are, that I'm not parting with Captain Tietjens!
He's the only officer on the base who can get his draft into marching order on time.
Not that he isn't a confounded nuisance.
I could give them Captain McKechnie when he's back from divorce leave.
He's sane enough for horses, isn't he?
Captain McKechnie HAS returned from leave, sir, but he omitted to get divorced.
How DARE he not get divorced!
He told me his wife was co-habiting with an...
Egyptian, wasn't it?
Some sort of dago, anyway.
No, sir, an EGYPTOLOGIST.
They've agreed to share her.
That dirty dog!
I'll strip him of his commission!
A damn fine officer when he isn't going mad, and a Vice Chancellor's Latin prize man, as well.
Another brilliant fellow, like Tietjens.
That's a thought.
They can be brilliant together.
BELL RINGS
Does "subter" take the accusative or the ablative?
Both.
Accusative when it's "under" as a motion, and ablative when it's "under" as a state.

Mrs Christopher Tietjens,
"whose husband is in hospital at the Front"!
Sylvia must have told them that herself.
HE SCOFFS
The paper wouldn't put the knife into her.
Women like Sylvia are the jam on their bread and butter.
But why would she do that?
To let him know she's on the warpath.
Well, don't worry about Christopher, it was only pneumonia, and not at the Front.
He's 100 miles from the nearest German trench.
His job is kitting out fresh troops on their way to the fighting.
Nothing to worry about but air raids.
But are they dropping bombs on him?
My dear, they're dropping bombs on you, and yet here you are.
But I thought Christopher was looking after horses somewhere safe.
That's the War Office for you.
But an Infantry Base Depot is a soft posting, so long as you're not sent back to your battalion.
Anything but the trenches!
THEY ROAR AND SCREAM
Move it, move it, move it!
Shoulder... arms!
Present... arms!
Shoulder... arms!
Quick... march!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right...
Hmm.
General Campion is attaching Captain McKechnie to my unit for rations and discipline.
What's that about?
I can't say as I can say, sir.
"A Vice-Chancellor's Latin prize man".
Well, I'm sure that will come in useful fire-extinguishers.
We indented the Royal Engineers.
Sir.
The Royal Engineers said, as per army directive 1BDR 3417, for fire-extinguishers, we should apply to Ordnance.
Ordnance said there's no provision for them for Canadian units passing through an Infantry Base Depot, and that the proper course would be to obtain them from a civilian firm and charge them against barrack damages.
Yes, sir.
I have here a letter from the leading British manufacturer of fire-extinguishers, telling me that they have been forbidden by the War Office to sell fire-extinguishers to anyone but to the War Office direct.
Thank God we have a navy.
Yes, sir.
Cardiff Police Office... 0-9 Morgan is outside, sir.
Application for compassionate leave.
His wife has sold their laundry business to someone, name of Evans.
Now she can't get the money.
True in as far as it goes.
The police say his wife is now living with Mr Evans, a prize-fighter, and we should keep 0-9 Morgan here if we know what's good for him.
In he comes.
Sir.
0-9 Morgan, present yourself to the officer, at the double!
Well now, 0-9 Morgan... .. because there are things I have to discuss with Christopher, and what is the point in being permanent secretary of the Department of Transport if you can't transport me -
I put it like that - between London and Rouen?
This is family business, Mark.
I have to go to the office.
SHE SIGHS
As far as I'm concerned,
Groby is Christopher's to do what he likes with.
So if you can produce his written authorisation,
I have no objection to your living at Groby.
But, of course, if what you say is true, he might want to live at Groby with Miss Wannop.
Well, that's why I'm asking you now...
I'm afraid you overestimate my authority, which does not extend to France, and in any case, does not exceed General Campion's in matters that concern the army.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Utter nonsense!
I'll buy a ticket at the station!
See if they can stop me.
Never known a woman like her.
She says she's going to come and see for herself!
On no account...
On NO account is Mrs Tietjens to be allowed within 50 miles of Rouen.
Understood?
Inform the War Office, the Provost Marshal, the port authorities and the rail authorities.
I will not have skirts around my HQ!
More importantly, General Perry is now on the telephone twice a day.
He has troops who were due to be relieved weeks ago, and I have troops waiting for Ordnance to supply them with eyebrow tweezers while our political masters keep changing their minds whether to send them up the line or ship them to Salonika or Mesopotamia or Timbuktu!
But I have one draft of Canadian troops ready to go to the Front today.
That's the draft prepared by Captain Tietjens's unit.
Captain Thurston, do I have the trains or do I not?
You have the trains, sir, and the co-operation of the French railway, going east to the Front, certainly.
I want these troops on their way to Flanders before London can blink!
Oui, mon general.
Champagne at two o'clock!
Which train, Madam?
Oh, I don't know.
Dover, I expect.
Sylvia!
Potty!
What are you doing here?
King's Messenger!
King's Messenger?
Yes.
Glorified postman, really, but frightfully important!
Locked carriages, private cabins, saluted through the gate.
Oh!
Where are you off to?
Where are you?
This way, sir.
Gosh, I've missed you, Sylvia.
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
Thank you.
Captain.
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Everyone got a glass?
Splendid.
PHONE RINGS
Well, then, it's been our pleasure to fit out you and your men for the task ahead.
Somebody deal with that telephone.
It's a great task, and thanks to Captain Tietjens and his unit, you Canadians go to the front in good order.
You will be relieving soldiers who've been in the trenches for many weeks.
Believe me, 3,000 fresh troops under keen, young officers is just what the Hun doesn't want to face in our part of the line.
Discipline and training will keep you alive.
Remember it.
I'll be at the railhead to see you off.
Form-up at 2000, air raids permitting.
That's in the event of there being no further orders.
Thank you!
Captain Tietjens, come with me!
The draft has been countermanded.
I'll find out what's going on, but you'd better be ready to get the men back under canvas tonight.
Yes, sir.
May I ask...?
No, you may not.
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
I can't tell you where overseas these new orders will be taking you, but, believe me, the war where you're going is every bit as important as the war in Flanders and you WILL get your chance at the Hun.
PHONE RINGS
I dare say you're disappointed.
Stop that telephone.
But I know that you Canadians will enjoy the challenge and some rather warmer weather.
That's, er, a clue for you.
You will form your men up at 1700 hours for the march to the railhead.
We'll try to send you off by 1900, before the expected air raid.
That's all, gentlemen.
Good luck!
It was Major Perowne, sir, calling for a driver.
He's at the station.
Good.
And...
And he's got Mrs Tietjens with him.
I will break you for this.
I will smash you.
General!
How lovely!
We've all been missing you.
Tietjens.
May I ask a small favour for my orderly?
His mother's come from Montreal to say goodbye to him.
A pass to leave the camp?
If he misses the draft, you'll get me shot.
She's lost two sons already.
He could see her and still be back in time for the draft.
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS
If I could scream louder than the bombs, that would fix it, then I'd be all right.
McKechnie, control yourself!
She sold it to some bugger called Evans.
If I thought it was William Evans of Castell Coch, I'd desert.
Don't talk that way, Morgan!
You'll get your leave soon.
Midnight before we can march them out.
It's not right to keep men hanging about.
They don't like it.
For heaven's sake, can't you set an example?
!
Lost the fuckers!
Not so much swear words, 0-5 Thomas.
Now that it's gone quiet, sir, we could send one of the runners to the sergeant-cook, tell him we're going to indent for the draft's suppers.
We can send the other one with the 128s to the quarter.
Send the runner to Depot and say that if candles are not provided for my orderly room by return of bearer,
I, Captain Tietjens, commanding Number XVI Casual Battalion, will bring the whole matter of supplies before Base HQ tonight.
Come on, you two, 0-9 Morgan to the cookhouse at the double.
Yes, Sarge.
Move yourselves!
What's it all about?
That's what I want to know!
You're no sort of soldier!
They say up at HQ that your wife's got hold of your friend, the general.
I know all about you.
You are very much mistaken if you think the general a friend of mine.
I haven't a friend in the world.
Sergeant-Major, make sure the Canadian troops don't leave their dug-outs till the All Clear!
HE PANTS AND WHIMPERS
Look, are you mad?
Stark staring?
If you let yourself go, you'll go further than you wish.
CANNONS FIRE
They must imagine that they've found the Hun again.
I must say, you look divine in your uniform.
Enchante, Madam.
I knew le brave Capitaine and his wife in London before the war, and didn't we see each other somewhere in France in 1912?
Here in Rouen, Madame.
Extraordinaire!
Does Christopher know I'm here?
No.
As soon as his draft leaves for the station, he'll have a few hours to come to the hotel.
Failing that, all my officers are under orders to attend my regular entente cordiale party tomorrow.
Why can't I see him now?
You may have noticed there's an air raid.
Isn't that normal where the war is?
The Captain's on duty and can't leave the camp.
I've booked you the room next to his.
There's a connecting door.
If Christopher is billeted at the hotel, why doesn't he sleep there?
He bunks down in the hut lines.
We're working under difficult circumstances.
Are we?
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS
Don't think I'm afraid of a bit of shrapnel.
They ought to let my orderly room have tin hats.
Headquarters are full of Huns doing the Huns' work.
Do you believe that tripe?
It's the English doing it.
NEARBY EXPLOSION
HE PANTS
Nearly got me, surely to goodness, but I did run, I did run!
All right, Thomas.
You can go into shelter with the Colonial troops, if you like.
No, I'll wait for my mate, 0-9 Morgan, Captain, sir.
I was in for the Foreign Office before all this began.
I suppose you speak seven languages.
Five.
And Latin and Greek, of course.
AEROPLANE APPROACHES Here it comes.
EXPLOSION
Here's another bloomin' casualty.
0-9 Morgan?
Oh, poor fucking 0-9 Morgan!
Surely to goodness, I didn't even recognise him!
Get out from under him, blast!
This ain't your job, sir.
You'll get all sticky.
Bugler, call two sanitary lance-corporals and four men!
Thomas.
0-9 Morgan was your mate?
He was a good pal.
Poor old bugger.
But you would not like, surely to goodness, to go to mess with your shoes all bloody.
If I'd given him leave, he would not be dead now.
No, surely he would not.
But it is all one.
Your honour is a good captain.
I know why Christopher doesn't sleep at the hotel.
He's got his mistress in Rouen, with the child.
How old is that child now?
Five?
No.
Of course not.
I know nothing about...
If you're talking about Miss Wannop, I'm not prepared to...
Even if his treatment of you has been...
Yes, Miss Wannop, Christopher's little suffragette.
SHE LAUGHS
I've nothing against them being pro-German,
I have German friends myself.
I say, steady on.
Yes, stop doing... what does your mother call it?
Shower-baths.
Is Sylvia pulling the strings of the shower-bath?
I say, I say, they've got the vote, though.
Saw it in the Sketch.
Will you vote, Mrs Tietjens?
I am not going to the hotel until I have seen Christopher with my own eyes.
There's a note from your foul General.
What does it say?
"For God's sake.
Can't you control your woman?"
Well, it didn't say it was private.
"You are more trouble to me than all the rest of my command put together. "
Give me the rhyme-words for a sonnet.
That's the scheme of it.
I know what a damn sonnet is.
What's your game?
Give me 14 end-rhymes of a sonnet and I'll write a sonnet.
In two and a half minutes.
If you do, I'll translate it into Latin hexameters in under three minutes.
Get on with it then!
A, B, B, A. A, B...
Yes, what is it?
!
Good God, who are you?
Hotchkiss.
They said to find you.
Are you Captain Tietjens?
Don't you know how to address an officer?
Oh, yes, sorry.
Sir!
How long have you been in the army?
Two weeks.
There you are.
Two and a half minutes from now.
I have to go to Division horse line, and I seem to have been put in charge of taking your soldiers to some place called Bailleul...
Er, sir.
I shall endeavour to be, er... swift.
There's pink-eye running rife in all the service horses.
I've made a study of it.
I was sent for by the War Office.
I suppose Lord Beichen knew about me from my publications.
I'm a professor of equine studies.
Well, you're a stout fellow.
You should talk to Colonel Johnson.
You'll find him in 16 IBD Mess.
He'll be interested to meet you.
He's got a Hun horse captured on the Marne.
I ride Schomburg, myself.
Well, if you say so.
Many thanks.
Two minutes and 11 seconds.
I'm not starting till I've checked it's a sonnet.
GSO 2, sir.
You understand I've not read it.
I'll turn it into Latin in the time stipulated when I'm free.
KNOCK ON DOOR
The Canadian draft has not left yet!
We shall be strafed to hell.
We had to wangle everything, sir.
Desert boots, malaria powders, and then unwangle everything in a hurry when it was changed back to Bailleul.
It makes you wonder who's in charge, sir.
Ah, I see you're there, McKechnie.
Feeling well?
Feeling fit?
Look here, can you spare me 10 or 20 minutes?
It's not exactly a service matter.
You have to come down to the gate.
I hate to keep a woman waiting.
You mean, your...?
As it happens, I was spotted at the station and now my French lady-friend thinks I've got an English mistress.
Come on!
Are you dragging me there to deal with your absurd love-life?
Mine?
It's yours!
The poor woman is in a dreadful state of anxiety about you.
You haven't written to her once, she says.
You can't mean Miss Wannop?
Do you swear it?
Cross my heart, Miss.
I saw the captain with my own eyes this very morning, Miss!
I've been dreadfully worried about him.
You're welcome to wait in the guardroom, Miss.
No, it's perfectly all right.
I don't want to disturb Captain Tietjens when he's on duty, so long as he's all right.
You've all been absolutely sweet.
Oh, God!
Sylvia!
Dammit!
She's taken the car!
FAINT SOUND OF MARCHING
'Battalion, halt!
'
KNOCKS AT DOOR
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
Dash it!
BUGLE PLAYS
SOUND OF MARCHING
The draft's come back!
Oh, for the love of God!
By the way, did you give a pass to a Canadian?
Why?
He missed the curfew and the Redcaps nabbed him.
A few minutes before the curfew, you witnessed this prisoner saying goodbye to his mother, and the prisoner called you a damn brute for no reason, least of all because you made some discourteous comment about the old lady, is that right?
Yes, sir!
Then, having engaged the prisoner in conversation, by no means calling him "a blankety-blank colonial conscript", you discovered it was 11:02, so very properly charged him with being off-base and "conduct prejudicial".
Sir!
Mark the charge sheet as "case explained".
Dismiss!
Sir!
I am a hair's breadth from recommending a court of inquiry into your conduct.
If there is any, ANY repetition, by God, you will regret it.
Witnesses dismiss!
Provost-Marshall won't like it, sir.
General O'Hara loves his police like his own ewe-lambs.
The French railwaymen going on strike was a bit of luck for that Canadian lad, though, and lucky for me, too!
They heard a rumour the draft was for overseas.
If anyone needs me I'm going to ride Schomburg to the Hotel de la Poste to take my wife to the General Campion's tea party for the locals.
What the hell is the Colonel's horse doing in horse standings?
Don't you know Schomburg by now?
Yes, sir.
The 'oss has been put in 'oss-standings by orders of Lieutenant Hotchkiss.
Did you tell him that it was my orders that Schomburg be kept warm in the stables of the farm behind XVI IBD?
The lieutenant says 'osses have to be hardened, sir.
He also says how any departure from his orders would be visited by the extreme displeasure of Lord Beicham, KCVO, etc.
Well, listen carefully.
I am going to ride Schomberg over to the Hotel de la Poste, so saddle him up and meet me there, where you will take him back to the farm stables.
Make sure the windows are closed and stop up any chinks.
Give him oatmeal and water, hot as he can take it.
Finally, if Lieutenant Hotchkiss makes any comments, refer him to me.
Yes, sir.
How can you forget?
It's the very place where you left me and ruined my life!
So fair's fair.
Will you leave your door unlocked tonight?
There's Christopher!
I can see him in the glass.
He's seen me, too.
Good God, what are we going to do?
What'll HE do?
He'll smash me to pieces!
He wouldn't do anything to you.
A decent man doesn't hit girls.
Damn his chivalry!
So as not to embarrass me, he'll leave it to me.
Pardon.
I did not see madame.
Dites a ce monsieur que je suis occupee.
He looks ill.
What's he doing?
Giving me the social backing he thinks it's his duty as my husband to give.
He's Jesus Christ calling on the woman taken in adultery.
By all the saints, I'll make that wooden face wince yet.
I'll bring him to heel.
He's going upstairs.
He's probably gone to wreck your bedroom.
SHE SCOFFS
It's no use trying to awaken sentimental memories in me.
Does Christopher have a girl in this town?
No, he's too much of a stick.
He never even goes to Madame Suzette's.
Now, look here, will you let me come to your room tonight or not?
SHE LAUGHS
What's your game?
Hell and hounds, you can't have come here for HIM!
What's your game?
I'm going to tidy up before the General's tea party.
Wait for me.
I won't look like I can't find a man to escort me.
Campion will send me to the trenches if it looks like that.
Do you mean you wouldn't die for me, Potty?
Hang it all, what a cruel fiend you are.
I'm a woman desperately trying to get her husband back.
If Christopher would throw his handkerchief to me,
I would follow him round the world in my shift.
No, you wouldn't.
You're just wanting to make him squeal.
For that I'll leave my door unlocked, and be damned to you.
I don't say you'll get anything, or like what you get, but it's up to you.
Colonel, may I introduce you to Monsieur Dupree,
Regional Manager of the railway.
Railways?
Oh dear, oh dear.
What's going on with you chaps?
Look!
Hating the Hun has to come first, otherwise what's the giddy limit?
IN FRENCH:
Well, why do you treat her so damnably?
Sir, I don't have to discuss my private life..
I mean, for heaven's sake, Sylvia is the finest, the cleanest...
My dear!
Come to do your bit for the Grand Alliance?
You've already seen each other.
Yes, I made time to stop off at the hotel, sir.
Good.
Sir, if I may trouble you...
CONVERSATION INAUDIBLE
Well, I suppose I should thank you for being clear.
I don't understand you.
You didn't come back to the hotel to sleep.
You prefer all the fun of camping out with your Boy Scouts, do you?
Or did you spend the night with your mistress in her little nest in this frightful town?
I hardly got any sleep anywhere.
There was a railway strike.
I was landed with 3,000 men
I'd despatched to the front lines three hours earlier.
The French way of telling us that...
I'll scream if you don't stop.
Sorry.
I've forgotten how... .. how to be at peace, I suppose.
How is Michael?
He hasn't written to me.
He hardly knows you.
I came to settle things between us.
Will you come to the hotel tonight?
See?
Still sealed.
I'll send a driver for you in the morning, 0800.
Where am I going?
You're going to the station and think yourself lucky.
I will.
You've been sweet.
Hurry up, girls!
The bell's about to go.
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.
So does the new law mean you'll vote in the next election, Miss?
If I'm old enough.
I won't be 30 for... years!
Do you know Mrs Pankhurst, Miss?
She's your heroine, isn't she, Miss?
Well, I don't know, Annie.
I'm certainly not hers.
She said the other day that pacifism was a disease.
You wouldn't be a pacifist if your sweetheart was in the war, would you, Miss?
More than ever, of course.
Hurry up, the bell will go in a minute.
Have you got a sweetheart in the war, Miss?
I...
SHE SHRIEK
THE GIRLS LAUGH
MUSIC PLAYS
Captain Tietjens.
I got your report on the Canadian prisoner.
I must say, marking "case explained" on a charge sheet I signed myself is pretty strong.
If you would see fit, sir, to instruct your men not to call Colonial troops "damned conscripts... "
They are damned conscripts!
No, sir, not one of them.
Voluntarily enlisted.
Why, you insolent...!
You haven't heard the last of it!
Sir!
Christopher.
You look half dead.
Not far off it.
Have you had dinner?
Mmm.
I vamped an old fool of a general over a cutlet.
Then the air raid started and he went off to order everybody about.
General O'Hara.
Just had the pleasure.
What have you been doing?
Since I saw you?
Let me think.
Well, I have inspected 2,934 toothbrushes, most of which were clean, as the soldiers use their button-brushes for their teeth, to keep their toothbrushes clean for inspections.
So you betrayed me with a battalion!
You want a brandy?
I'll ring down.
Rum and hot water, if you would.
Of course.
Would you like to bathe?
I think I would, you know.
EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
It's sheer cheek putting a gun where people of quality might be wishing to sleep or converse.
They're not answering.
I'll try again.
I've brought a few letters for you.
Two from Mrs Wannop, who doesn't realise her daughter is your mistress, and one from your brother, Mark, which begins,
"Your bitch of a wife came to see me".
You should read that first, it's what I came to see you about.
Thank you.
The War Office brilliantly sent it on to the flat.
I've always understood that your idea of a marriage is that a husband and wife should be able to read each others' letters.
Of course.
I'll go...
EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
KNOCK AT DOOR
Monsieur.
Thank you.
What is it?
The draft has been brought forward.
I have to be at the camp by 4:30.
It's ridiculous that a man of your ability should be at the beck and call of a lot of gaga old fools like the one downstairs.
You shouldn't be here at all.
You're not fit.
Nobody posted to a Base Depot is fit.
That's why we're here.
I'm sorry you felt you had to come all this way to settle something
I'd be perfectly happy for you to have settled for yourself.
Groby is at your disposal if you want to live there with Michael, and, of course, with sufficient income to keep it up.
That means you don't intend to live there yourself.
Or you intend to get killed.
I should warn you that if you do get killed, I shall cut down the cedar.
It darkens the drawing room and the rooms above.
At last I changed the expression on your face.
I haven't the slightest intention of getting killed.
But it's not really up to me.
If I were to be sent back to my battalion...
Your brother refers to me as "that whore".
I haven't had a man, Christopher, for five years and more.
Not one.
I haven't let myself be kissed, or touched.
Not once, not since Perowne.
Potty Perowne!
Can you see how I must have been feeling, to go off with a fool like Potty?
I was not in my senses.
I broke under your forbearance, your permanent well-mannered forgiveness for my doing the dirty on you when I married you, not knowing...
Still don't know whether my child was yours or Gerald Drake's.
You forgave... without mercy.
To scream blue murder and throw me out would have been a kindness compared to five years under your roof, banished from your comfort.
SHE SCOFFS
Look what you've brought me to.
Throwing myself at you in my whore's trousseau!
My heat must have put a spell on all the sentries and ticket-inspectors... .. the musk of five years' wanting a man.
They must have smelled it.
Well...
.. don't bother now.
I've changed my mind...
SHE LAUGHS
What's going on?
Get into bed.
I didn't see who it was.
Potty, I expect.
I'd forgotten about him!
Where is the hussy?
This is my wife's room.
I must ask you to leave this instant.
We'll see whether she's your wife or not!
Leave this room!
You assaulted an officer.
Are you drunk?
By God, I'll have you for that!
If you do not take General O'Hara away,
I will order you to arrest him for drunkenness.
Consider yourself under arrest!
Return to your quarters!
SHE LAUGHS
Well!
What a lark!
I am under arrest.
Why must you...?
Everywhere you go..
Oh, Potty asked for it.
I'm sure he did.
I asked for it, too.
Sylvia, I...
I'm so sorry.
SIREN WAILS
THE BAND PLAYS
'He said they could have as much coal as they wanted 'at 1914 pithead prices. '
I notice, Captain Tietjens, that you have no fire-extinguishers on your unit.
You're aware of the disastrous consequences that would follow a conflagration?
Yes, sir.
I was informed by Ordnance that there is no provision for fire-extinguishers for Dominion troops under an Imperial officer.
So, I applied, as advised, to a civilian firm...
I didn't ask for your memoirs.
Make a note, Levin.
Go and get your belt.
You can go round your cookhouses with me in a quarter of an hour.
You can tell your sergeant-cook.
You are aware, sir, that I am under arrest?
I gave you an order to perform a duty!
Sir!
You're doing splendidly.
You understand, you're released from arrest if you're given an order to perform a duty.
Of course I understand.
It's the last thing I want!
You can't refuse!
A court martial would be...
He'd be...
He thinks the world of...
What did Perowne say?
Perowne told General O'Hara...
Oh, I couldn't possibly!
He told O'Hara he went to Mrs Tietjens's room at her invitation?
It's impossible to believe anything against...
No, it's true.
He did.
But my wife was after fun, not adultery.
What has she told the General?
The general has not seen Mrs Tietjens.
He couldn't trust himself.
He said she'd twist him round her little finger.
He's learning.
He refused to let Perowne speak.
He said Perowne could choose between going up the line and being broke by his regiment.
My God.
He believes so absolutely in Mrs Tietjens.
It's broken the General's heart.
Something he heard from the Capitaine, the liaison officer...
You!
Put that down and tell Sergeant Case to report to my quarters at the double.
Yes, sir.
I'm supposed to ask you, was O'Hara drunk?
The General is anxious for your opinion.
He and O'Hara graduated together from Sandhurst.
Then, O'Hara was not drunk.
Campion will be immensely gratified.
As Provost-Marshal, he had the right to enter my room.
I pushed him out, which is an assault on a senior officer.
I'd be happy to plead guilty to that.
And to being drunk, of course.
An officer doesn't strike generals sober.
Your mania for taking the blows...
I'd rather be broken than have this hell raked up.
Case!
General Campion will be going round the cook-house in 15 minutes.
Right, sir!
Don't serve out white clothing.
The General likes to see them in white.
He won't know white clothing has been countermanded, sir.
If you do that, one of your cooks will tuck a dirty piece of clothing into a locker where the General will find it.
Yes, sir, there's always one piece of clothing left in a locker for GOCIC's inspection and General Campion will always find it.
I've seen him do it three times.
This time, the man it belongs to goes for a court martial.
Sir!
Sit down.
Captain Tietjens, I would be glad of your careful attention.
This afternoon, you will receive a movement order.
You are not to regard it as a disgrace.
It is a promotion.
I am requesting General Perry to give you the appointment of second-in-command of the Vlth Battalion of his regiment.
What's your medical category?
Permanent base, sir.
My chest is rotten.
I should forget that if I were you.
The second-in-command of a battalion has nothing to do but sit about in armchairs waiting for the colonel to be killed.
If you say so, sir.
Who is your sergeant-cook?
Sergeant Case, sir.
Sergeant Case?
He was in the Drums when we were in Delhi.
He ought to be at least a Quartermaster now, but there was a woman he called his "sister".
He still sends money to his "sister", sir.
He went absent over her when he was a Colour-Sergeant.
Reduced to the ranks.
20 years ago, that must be.
God help you, Chrissie, there's nothing else I can do.
I can't put you on my staff.
You crossed General O'Hara in some row over his redcaps, never mind threatening him with arrest, so now you've a black spot against your name as regards access to Intelligence.
Next, dammit, the commander of the 9th French army is an intimate friend of mine, but in the face of your confidential report from your time in French liaison, that's blocked.
If you examine the detail of the report, sir, you will see the unfavourable inclusion is initialled by an Intelligence Officer, Major Drake, who... doesn't like me.
What difference does that make?
Not many officers DO like you.
Are you aware that there's one hell of a strafe put in against you by a RASC Second-Lieutenant called Hotchkiss?
That was about Schomburg, sir.
I'd rather die than subject any horse for which I'm responsible to the damnable theories of Lieutenant Hotchkiss!
It looks as if you WILL die on that account.
There was a request from your brother, Mark, through Room G14-R of the War Office that you be given command of the horse lines of the 19th Division, but the 19th Division's attached to Fourth Army now,
and it's Fourth Army horses that Hotchkiss is to play with.
How can I send you there to be under his orders?
Yes, sir.
You cannot.
I can send you home, in disgrace, or I can send you to your battalion.
You're finished here.
I cannot have men commanded by an officer with a private life as incomprehensible and embarrassing as yours.
Yes, sir.
I took that woman to be a saint!
I swear she IS a saint!
There is no accusation against Mrs Tietjens, sir!
By God, there is!
You let me think...
I remember every word of our conversation in Rye, letting me think Sylvia had gone abroad to look after her mother.
Sylvia and Perowne were seen together by Capitaine Thurston at the Hotel de la Poste in 1912!
Can you beat it?
Were they?
Well, what is one to do when a woman is unfaithful?
Sir.
Divorce the harlot!
Or live with her, like a man!
What sort of a fellow wouldn't see that?
But there is... or used to be... .. among families of position...
.. a certain...
Well?
Call it, parade!
Was there?
Well, there are no more parades for that regiment.
It held out to the last man, but you were him.
MARCHING BAND STRIKES UP
Open that, will you, my man?
Yes, sir.
I hope you had a good visit, Miss.
Very good, thank you.
Did the draft get off, do you know?
It did, Miss.
Captain Tietjens' draft, at five o'clock.
You know the army, then, Miss?
The lingo?
I should say so!
I'm the Captain's lady.
What do you think it's like, when you know this is it?
Death!
You are surely not in love with Christopher?
You mustn't be.
Every word Christopher Tietjens and I ever said to each other was a declaration of love.
GUNFIRE You feel no pain.
But if my husband thinks he can throw me over for that scrub-faced ladies' champion of the regular bowel movement...
He's the only man who perhaps wouldn't.
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd
Come on up here, pretty girl!
Previously on "Nashville"...
What's wrong?
I respect any woman too much to do that outside the confines of marriage.
Drop out the race, Teddy.
There is no affair.
You have till the weekend to decide.
After that, these get leaked to the press.
I'd like you to do a duet to help bolster the reputation of a fellow Edgehill artist.
Who?
I cannot believe we have to do this.
Well, let's just get it over with.
We'll never have to do it again.
This is gonna be huge.
That was a lot more fun than I thought it was gonna be.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
Unbelievable.
You guys could not top that if you tried.
Nah, it wasn't half bad.
Apart from the company.
We are gonna release that song as a live single.
Okay.
Amazing.
I don't know what to say.
How about saying...
"Rayna, I'm so excited to release your new album"?
All right, it's a deal.
Whoo!
Hey!
Juliette and I performed together, and, you know, everybody survived.
You know?
Yep.
Hey, Liam.
Welcome to Edgehill-Republic.
Yep, to us.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Now don't let me stop the celebrating.
That was fantastic.
You were... you were great out there tonight.
Thanks, babe.
Oh, well, we'll get out of you guys' hair.
Rayna, again, fantastic.
Call you tomorrow.
Okay, thanks, buck.
See you, buck.
Rayna, makes sure this one behaves himself, okay?
Ha!
You get no promises from me on that.
Bye, love.
Bye, babe.
Take care.
Thanks.
See you later.
Thanks for everything, Liam.
Hey.
You good to go?
Uh, you want have a glass of champagne first?
Let's, uh, let's have some at home.
I'll go get the girls.
Okay.
What kind of pictures?
Just shots of us talking.
And... and there's one of me giving Peggy a hug.
I find it really hard to believe that anybody, especially Coleman, would try to leak photos of two people talking.
I mean, look, the fact is, I'm winning, and Coleman thinks that a fabricated affair is enough to make me drop out.
Is it fabricated?
Rayna, I did not have an affair.
Well, then what were you doing in a public park with Peggy Kenter?
Peggy shared something with me in confidence, okay?
Now the truth is, she and Robert are having some trouble.
She signed this prenup, and she's scared that he's gonna leave her.
So she came to you for accounting advice?
She just wanted to talk to someone without it being gossiped about later.
That's not happening for any of us, especially our children.
Yeah, I know, and that's the part that pisses me off the most.
I just don't understand why Coleman would do this.
I don't...
I mean, is winning this election so important?
Apparently so.
It says, "Juliette, here's to the next 25 years on our label",
"your family at Edgehill-Republic.
Sincerely, Marshall Evans."
It's very nice.
I mean, I love flowers.
But I don't want flowers.
I want my tour back on, Glenn.
Hold on.
Xx
It's nobody.
I get it.
I get this is a step in the right direction.
Hold on.
Hey, babe.
Hey, let me call you back.
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Running my best splits in, like, two weeks.
You are good motivation.
What, you ran here?
Yeah.
Why?
Because I like you.
So does Nashville.
Xx yeah, Glenn said he's been getting some calls from promoters.
So...
Uh, my dad's pacing me.
Gotta go.
Wait a second.
He can wait for a minute.
Uh, I really... gotta go.
Oh, God.
Are you serious?
How long you gonna keep up this whole "no sex until marriage" thing?
Till I'm...
Married.
Look, that's just how my parents raised me.
Okay?
Well...
I'm gonna have to give 'em a piece of my mind about that.
You could meet 'em.
Uh, pace car's gettin' antsy.
So will you... meet 'em?
Yeah.
When?
Church.
Tomorrow.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Church?
You a little stressed out, Cy?
Deacon.
Deacon, Kelly.
Kelly, Deacon.
Hey, Kelly.
Thanks, babe.
How you doing, man?
Oh, yeah.
I'm doing good.
I mean, I'm not doing this good, but....
You remember that dive hotel we used to play at in Franklin?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, the Lomax inn.
Long way from the Lomax to the hall of fame.
I must've got off the wrong bus somewhere.
How long y'all in town for?
Uh, we're here for a week.
Do some overdubs, and then, uh, off to Asia or Australia or...
Oh, no.
Ha ha ha!
Freakin' Deacon!
The man, the myth.
Don't you call me a legend, Kent.
I'm not dead yet.
Hey, brother, you and Rayna...
You killed it the other night at the Ryman.
I mean, we think you never sounded better.
Thank you.
Where is Dubbie?
Well, Dubbie's hanging up his strat, which is why...
We want you to hit the road with us when we head back out.
Seriously?
2-year contract.
And if everybody's still diggin' it, then...
Full member.
You could have your choice of any picker still livin'.
Why me?
We figure you'd be a good person to bring on tour with us.
One year, huh?
Six months for me.
What, all of you?
A sober band.
Who woulda thunk it?
Not me.
That explains the soda pop, though, huh?
Yeah, well, you know, everything happens for a reason.
Maybe you weren't supposed to come out with us until now.
Maybe.
Would like a little time to think about it, if that's all right.
Well, sleep on it, man.
I appreciate it.
What's keeping you tied down here in Nashville?
Scarlett "ring of fire" O'Connor.
You are making fun of me.
Oh, he's not.
He's been talkin' about it all day.
Well, it was good, and it was worth talking about.
I'll see you upstairs.
Okay.
You really were good, you know.
Thank you.
I didn't know you had it in you.
Neither did I.
Two shots of Tequila...
apparently I'm transformed.
Listen, I...
I know this is a little crazy, but, um,
I know a band that's looking for a female lead singer.
I think you'd be perfect.
Oh.
Thank you.
Um, but I-I'm not a performer.
Ooh, I disagree.
Well, I only just started getting used to songwriting.
I have to talk to Gunnar about th... this is Scott... the lead guitarist for the epic fails.
Doesn't hurt to call, right?

incredible!
Word of the day... wow!
Yeah.
And how long y'all been together?
Since junior high.
J.T. and I started playing together in Ohio.
We rocked black sabbath at a seventh grade assembly.
Yeah.
It was a catholic school, so we got suspended for a week.
But...
The fact that y'all stuck together tell me a lot about y'all.
Let me holler at you real quick.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
I love what you're doing...
some incredible stuff.
Thanks.
But I think we could dirty up the vocals just a little bit.
Okay.
Why don't you come down to A.T.L. with me?
Yeah?
Yeah, um...
I mean, I can...
I can drive there, yeah.
Really?
Drive, man?
I'm recession-proof.
I got my own plane.
You d.?
You in?
Yeah.
Okay.
You in?
Yeah, absolutely.
A'ight.
That's my man.
Let me walk you out.
All right, I'll see you there.

Come on.
What is it?
Hailey told me that she thinks I should...
Try out to be the lead singer of some band.
It's funny she would suggest that, knowing that we're supposed to be here writing' every day.
That's what I said.
Are you...
Really considering it?
No.
I don't know.
I mean, I had fun the other night.
But... mm.
I wanna keep doing this.

Rayna.
Could you excuse us for a minute, please?
Sure.
And shut the door.
Thank you so much.
Of course.
Rayna, look, I'm sorry, but Teddy and lamar... they have just been lying about me for so long.
It's just... it's time I start telling the truth.
You're gonna drag my family through the mud?
I'm just playing the same games they started.
Well, you know good and well Teddy's not a cheater.
Yeah, well, I thought so, too...
But you tell me.
If that's not an affair, then what is it, then?
It's none of your damn business, is what it is.
I am so sorry.
I thought you said Donelson Pike.
No.
It's no worries.
My apologies.
Mom, dad, I'd like you to... wow!
It's really you!
Guys, this is Juliette.
I have every single one of your songs.
You favorite's "drive-thru dreams."
I even tried to find those pink cowgirl boots you had in the video.
I loved those.
So this is Dana, your biggest fan.
Well, ni to meet you, Dana.
And those cowboy boots were definitely one-of-a-kind, for sure.
And it's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Butler.
Lovely.
Pleasure, Mr. Butler.
So I was, um, wondering, um...
Do you wanna sing with us in the choir today?
I asked our director Mrs. Malcolm, and she said okay.
Dana.
Oh, she didn't come to work, honey.
I think we can find something we both know.
Coleman has an agenda.
Coleman's got pictures.
These do not prove anything.
Tandy, you know, at this point, you're with my husband more than I am.
Is he having an affair?
No.
No.
Of course not.
There is nothing going on between those two.
And who is gonna cheat with his sister-in-law around?
Because I would scratch his eyes out myself.
You remember what I told you when I set you guys up on that first date?
What, that he's the opposite of Deacon and daddy?
No.
I said that he would make a good husband and a great father.
And he has.
It's gonna be okay.
Now I gotta go.
We're gonna have a strategy meeting.
We are gonna settle all of this.
Wait a minute.
Who's "we"?
Thanks.
Teddy.
Peggy, what are you doing?
You can't be here.
I have nowhere else to go.
Look, I don't know what to tell you, but you have to go now.
I told Robert that nothing happened!
He didn't believe me, and he's flying back from Hong Kong tonight.
Peggy, please.
Just go home and tell him the truth.
He'll believe you.
You can't just leave me here.
You need to stop this, okay?
I'm sorry.
Teddy.

Hey.
What are you doing here?
That's your record deal champagne.
Dominic Wells wants to work with me, so I'm flying to Atlanta in the morning.
Well, congratulations, Avery.
Look, I know things are what they are, but we always said that this bottle was for when I made it.
And...
I just wanted to say that we should've opened it when you got your deal.
So, uh... enjoy.
For both of us.
Thank you.
Good luck in Atlanta.
Thanks.
So what are you all doin' tonight?
Well, I gotta watch some film, and then dinner with the folks.
I always fix a big Sunday dinner when our Q.B. is in town.
Would you like to come, Juliette?
Really?
Yes!
Absolutely, I'd love to come.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Okay.
I guess that's a "yes."
You could take that as a "yes."
The most he can do is float 'em out to the gossip sites and blogs.
Yeah, well, that's all he needs to do.
Mainstream media will jump on the bandwagon soon enough.
Hey.
Y'all are having a meeting to talk about our family, and you didn't think to include me?
Rayna, you really shouldn't be... daddy, don't.
She's not leavin'.
Rayna, this really isn't anything you should have to be dealing with.
We have this under control, Rayna.
You don't have it under control.
And you're right, this is not anything that I should have to be dealing with, but I do have to deal with it 'cause our children are gonna have to deal with it if salacious pictures of their father, whom they worship,
come out.
You're absolutely right.
All right, look.
If these pictures do come out, I'll hold a press conference, and I'll tell the truth about them.
Lamar.
Well, I guess Coleman got tired of waitin'.
Xxx
this is red velvet.
You have to try it.
Did you tell Scarlett to join a band?
I..
Suggested she try out for one.
And why would you do that?
Because she's insanely talented.
If she's frontin' some band, it's not gonna be real easy to write.
You of all people know that that's not true.
Bands play at night, and you write during the day.
So you're making decisions about my partnership with Scarlett without asking me?
Um, that doesn't sound possessive and weird at all.
What's weird is that you're trying to separate Scarlett and me.
That's not what I was doing.
Are you sure?
I-I-I...
You don't think I saw the way you looked at her the other night, when you were so quick to come to her rescue?
What, in the bar?
That guy was a jerk!
She was doing fine on her own.
I was being a friend.
You were staking a claim.
So this is because you're jealous?
I just...
Prefer that my boyfriend be more interested in me.
You know?
So there it is.
There what is?
The reason this whole me and you thing was never gonna work.
Come on.
Hailey, wait.
It's over, Gunnar.
It's always been over.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, baby.
Come in.
Wow.
Hi.
Hi.
These are for you.
Oh, thank you.
Juliette, these are lovely.
Of course.
Thank you.
And these are for you.
Goodness.
Look what she gave me!
They're very sweet, but she can't accept them.
They must've cost a fortune.
No!
No, no, no.
Please, I insist.
I've never had a sister, so this is fun for me.
Thank you.
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.
Please?
Another day, another dollar.
You're still wondering where I'm standing with that band thing, aren't you?
Am I that obvious?
Well, I-I sent 'em the demo.
I doubt anything's gonna happen with it, though.
Would you stop doin' that?
All they need to do is hear you sing, and they're gonna want you.
Doubt it.
When you were singing in the bar...
I couldn't take my eyes off you.
No one could.
Gunnar...
Will you...
Please let me finish?
You're amazing.
You have more talent than...
anybody that I know.
Somebody should tell you that every day.
So...
I'm telling you.
That...
I can't do that.
I'm sorry.
I've wanted to do that since the day you walked in here.
You have a girlfriend.
No, I don't.
What?
We broke up.
You can't just go around kissing people 'cause you feel like it.
Well, then... then when should you?
Hey.
How's it goin'?
Hey.
Uh, great.
Um...
Is this where Peggy Kenter lives?
Yes.
Look, look.
Here she comes.
Oh, my goodness.
What happened?
Lady across the street said Robert came home and found her.
Said she took pills.
Right here.
Got it?
Peggy Kenter overdosed on sleeping pills.
She what?
Her husband came home and found her.
Otherwise, she would be dead.
Where'd you hear that?
Her neighbor.
What do you mean, her neighbor?
I went over there.
People don't...
Just try to kill themselves...
For no reason.
So what happened?
You had an affair with her, right?
No.
No, I didn't.
God, Rayna, this whole thing is becoming such a mess.
Yeah.
It was that damn cumberland deal.
My finances were falling apart.
I was doing everything to keep the thing afloat.
Then Peggy came up with this idea, and like a fool, I listened to her.
She said that nobody could get hurt.
Nashville's own Ed Fitzgerald, everybody!
Awesome.
Awesome.
Tonight, we have a very, very special treat.
Gunnar and Scarlett, the bluebird's very own...
Whatever song you want.
Uh, make sure you tip your waitresses.
N-not now.
Have a great evening, guys.
Well, I thought we could do one.
Well, hi.
Uh, tonight,
I'm gonna play you a little song that me and my partner, uh, Scarlett are still working on...
I hope.

Will you please just say something?
You stole money from a bank.
Which... which we paid back.
And then you and my father and my sister bribed an auditor.
Well, we did that to cover up the borrowing of the money.
These are crimes, Teddy.
I did it to protect our family.
You didn't do it to protect our family.
We never needed that money.
You did it for yourself.
I trusted you.
And you still can.
I don't think so.
You don't have to do that.
I need new boots.
Oh.
No, it's the least I can do.
Thank you so much for having me.
Hmm.
Well, you didn't give us much choice.
Pardon me?
We've worked hard to build Sean's bran and we won't see it tarnished just because he got himself tangled up in repairing yours.
Listen, Mrs. Butler, that may be how we met, but I genuinely care about your son, and it means a lot to me that you guys had me here tonight.
I've read about you.
I've read about your mother.
You?
This family?
Don't hold your breath, sweetie.
Hey.
You're up early.
So Teddy told me everything, from cumberland to today.
And you acted like you had no idea.
You asked me if he was having an affair, and I said that he wasn't.
He embezzled $2 million.
How long have you known?
I didn't find out till the beginning of the campaign.
Oh.
Oh, well, that makes it okay.
No.
No.
It wasn't supposed to get this turned upside-down.
I was really trying to save you from this.
It just happened.
It didn't happen.
Y'all made this happen.
Was that all part of the plan?
"Oh, Rayna'll just believe whatever Tandy tells her"?
That's not true, and you know it.
I don't know anything at this point, except that my husband's a thief, I guess.
No.
And you're just like daddy.
Y'all just deserve each other.
I mean, we... no!
That's not true.
You... don't bother.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry just to, you know, drop by.
Nah, come on in.
I was gonna call you this week.
So looks like the duet's up to number 15 on the charts.
Yeah.
Guess you and Rayna are gonna have to do a whole album together now, right?
Oh.
Very funny.
No, thank you.
It did get me thinking, though, that it was so easy to write with you, and I think we should do it again.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Although I might be out of town for a little while.
I just got an offer to play guitar for the revel kings.
The revel kings?
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God!
That's amazing!
Deacon, you're gonna...
you're gonna do it, right?
Maybe.
I'm thinking about it.
You're thinking about it?
Yeah.
Well, what is there to even think about?
I don't know.
You know, lots of things.
It's a big tour, lot of dates.
We'll see.
Uh-huh.
Look, that's not why I'm here.
Look.
It's from your mom.
Where'd you get that?
From rehab.
I've been going around, checking on her, seeing if she's doing all right.
No.
No, I don't want that.
You know, and I don't want you talking to her.
Juliette, look, honey, she's the only family you got in the whole world.
Uh, I... why is she sending you letters?
Because you won't answer her calls.
You know, I... she wants to make things right, you know?
She's...
I think if you read the letter, you'll see.
I'll see what?
Huh?
I'll be reminded that I had to eat dry pancake mix because all our money went up her nose?
Or that...
My first kiss was from one of her creepy boyfriends?
I know how important family is, Deacon, because I never had one.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
But she is, too.
Just leave.
Please.
You know what, Deacon?
Maybe if you spent a little less time meddling and more time fixing your own problems, you would see what a fool you are for even having to think about that tour.
Can I talk to you a minute?
What about?
About stuff you can't take back even if you want to.
Who said anything about taking it back?
Scarlett, I don't...
I don't regret kissing you.
Gunnar, I'm so confused.
Look, we, uh...
We should keep writing, uh, Jeanne's new songs, so... no, I know that Jeanne likes it when we write together, but our deals... are separate, and I just need a little bit of time
at the moment.
I'm... just a mess.
What?
Oh, come on.
Separate...
Cool, fine, whatever.
Good luck with your new band.
Thanks.
Renaissance man.
How you like that vintage?
I have to admit, I could get used to this.
And I'm really serious, though, about working with you.
Thanks.
It means a lot.
But like I said, serious about working with you.
Just you.
I don't...
I don't understand.
I mean, uh, what about my band?
Come on, man.
We'll build you up, and then you can get another set of guys.
Right...
But I've already...
I've already picked.
I mean, J.T. and I go way back.
You know that.
I ain't talkin' about going backwards.
I'm talking about going forwards, man.
Come on.
Ah, ah.
D-don't.
Don't kill your career before it starts.
After all these years, you can still jump that wall.
Thanks for calling.
I just wanna make sure you're okay.
Yeah, I am.
So it's true, then?
Sort of.
It's complicated.
Complicated.
That's the last thing I ever thought he was.
Well, we still got two daughters who think he hung the moon.
Anything I can do?
No.
How you doing?
What's going on?
Well, just got asked to go on tour with the revel kings.
That's the real deal.
That's what they tell me.
Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime.
They say that, too.
Yeah.
You gonna do it?
I don't know.
What do you think?
I think you gotta go off and see what's around the next bend.
I guess we both do.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I know those girls think that Teddy makes the world go round, but... they wouldn't even have a world without you.
What you're seeing in those pictures is nothing more than an old friend trying to help another navigate a tough patch.
Sadly, her accidental overdose, which followed this relentless, unwarranted media attention, was an outgrowth of that.
Now our thoughts... oh, my God.
And prayers are with Peggy Kenter...
Are with Peggy Kenter and her family, and we hope for a speedy recovery.
Would you... would you please excuse me?
You all know my lovely wife, Rayna James.
Good afternoon.
I apologize for my lateness.
I was, uh, picking up our daughters from school, you know, as parents do.
Teddy did that for us for years while I was out on tour, while he was juggling his career and his business.
He's a good father, and he's a good husband, and he's also a wonderful cook, thank goodness for me.
What he is not is a cheater.
I've been married to this man for 12 years.
I believe in his love for me.
I believe in his love for our children, and these pictures don't do anything
other than show the desperation of some people who are trying to bring us down.
So I'm not gonna dignify 'em with any further comment.
Thank you.
Miss Jaymes, a question... thank you for doing this.
I did it for our daughters.
This way, please.
Good, good, good, good.
I'm glad you guys are sitting down.
So... how's the writing going?
A little slow.
Real good.
Well, you're gonna need to crank it up, because we have officially received an offer to put one of your songs on hold.
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, what song?
"Fade into you." Yeah.
Oh, I-it's not a done deal yet, but it doesn't mean that this isn't your first big break, and something to be very excited about and, uh, something to...
Celebrate.
Whoa.
I suggest a toast to both of you.
I knew it when I met ya.
I knew it when I heard your first song, and now I know it for sure.
Let us toast to successful partnerships.
Cheers.
"Goes numb," right?
That's it, man.
Hey, Cy.
Hey, good news, man.
Deacon here already knows most of our songs.
Yeah, it helps that they all sound alike.
Oh, man, that's cold.
Yeah, that's very cold, man.
Well... what's it gonna be, man?
I guess I don't leave now, I'm never gonna.
Let's do it.
Yes!
Yeah.
Well, all right.
There you go.
It's from vichy... the best water in France.
Hey, to sex, no drugs, and rock 'n' roll.
Hear, hear.
All right!
♪Midnight angel♪
♪Blue-eyed baby♪
Hey.
I need a drink.
Yeah.
It's been a rough one for you, I know.
Thanks for keeping our meeting.
Could I get a vodka soda, please?
Thank you.
Now look, Rayna.
The fact is, people are loving the duet.
So it seems.
And we couldn't be more pleased with the way the single's performing.
It's shot both of you to the top of the charts.
Bucky and I just met with performance international.
They see a mutually beneficial opportunity sitting right in front of us, and I want you to know that the label fully supports it.
An arena tour.
You co-headlining with Juliette.
50/50 split, alternating who closes the show every night.

I'm blown away.
Previously on Transformers Prime...
Four sets of coordinates from Alpha Trion remain encrypted.
It is logical to conclude that each corresponds to the location of one of the Omega keys.
Scrap!
It appears identical to the one taken from me by Optimus Prime.
Pieces of a larger puzzle, perhaps.
Alpha Trion said we need all four keys to restore Cybertron, remember?
We just need to hang on to the one we have, find a way to get the others back from Megatron.
The final entry has been decoded.
The coordinates are forming an image.
Smokescreen?
Prime's latest recruit is the final relic of Iacon!
No!
2x23
- Inside Job
Wakey, wakey.
What?
!
If you're looking for your Phase Shifter, finders keepers.
Enough prattling, Knockout!
Hand me the final Iacon relic ...
now.
Yeah, I can't really help you.
That's the only one I was packing.
Soundwave.
You got the wrong guy, chief.
Optimus Prime's the one who can decode the Iacon database.
Ah, but you misunderstand.
The final entry has been decoded by us!
And according to our findings, it would appear I do indeed have the right guy.
The question is, what is it that you are still packing?
Why, hidden treasure, of course!
Smokescreen must have been taken aboard the Decepticon warship.
Tracing his signal through its shielding will be impossible.
Continue monitoring all frequencies, Ratchet.
Far more than Smokescreen's fate may be at stake.
I... don't get it.
How could Smoke be an Omega key?
Perhaps he isn't the key, but its container.
The other Iacon relics were sent to Earth in pods.
Why not this one?
When the Decepticons stormed Iacon, it may have been too late for Alpha Trion to launch the final Omega key into space ... at least, by standard means.
So Smokescreen assumed everything went black because he was hit by Decepticons.
But Alpha Trion's the one who actually turned out the kid's lights.
It stands to reason that my mentor did not want Smokescreen to know what he was carrying in the event of capture.
And with a mobile relic, Alpha Trion couldn't possibly supply fixed coordinates.
So the big "A" slipped us a clue instead...
Smoke's mug shot.
The Decepticons got to Smokescreen first.
I fear they have decoded the same clue.
Yet another of these identical relics?
- Remove it swiftly.
- With pleasure.
I do so resent a finish flashier than my own.
Ha!
Made you squirm.
Trippy.
And intuitive.
Proper grounding ensures that its user won't phase through the floor.
I said swiftly.
Get your stinkin' hand out of my gears!
Mm, and...
got you!
Tell me the function of these relics.
Doorstops?
Shavers?
Bling?
Beats me.
Hmm.
A pity this little gadget won't allow me to just reach into his brain pan and pluck out the info.
Fortunately, we possess a device that can.
Individually, each of these so-called Omega keys is useless.
Yet possessing even a single one grants me tremendous negotiating power with either Autobots or Decepticons.
Still, imagine if I manage to acquire the other three.
I could revive Cybertron and seize the throne as
Starscream I., supreme overlord and emperor of destruction!
A-ha... eh...
But unlike Megatron,
I lack the necessary infrastructure to enforce such a reign.
No warship, no army ...
only my meager laboratory finds, a ground-bridge remote control, a single remaining dose of
Red Energon, and you, old friend.
But I would all too gladly trade this simply to be restored to my former glory.
While I am unfamiliar with the lore of these Omega keys,
Alpha Trion knew many secrets, and the ancients possessed technology that has long been lost to what we consider modern science.
Whatever their function, this much is certain.
We cannot restore Cybertron without all four Omega keys in our possession.
The future of our home world depends on it.
That's a wrap.
The power to remake Cybertron as I see fit.
I will pry the other two keys from Optimus Prime's lifeless fingers.
We must find the exact location of the Autobot base.
Patch in and tear apart Smokescreen's mind, if you must.
Me?
Who else?
Do you think I would entrust you to see this key safely to the vault containing the other one?
Once more, into the brain pan.
No!
Not again!
Stay out of my head!
Now, now.
You'll only make things worse for yourself.
Worse how?
Well, aren't you the clever one?
This is ship is miles in the sky and swarming with Decepticons!
- Do you really think you can escape?
- Who says I'm lookin' to escape?
Think fast!
What?
!
No!
Oh, this isn't the way out?
The keys.
A pity you are incapable of flight.
Yeah, like I'm gonna let that stop me.
Smokescreen's signal, it's back online!
The kid escaped the warship!
Smokescreen to base.
I could really use a ground bridge.
Retrieve the Omega keys!
Quickly!
Fliers!
I need fliers!
Setting coordinates.
- Strange.
- What's the problem?
Smokescreen's telemetry data doesn't make sense.
I can't lock onto his position.
I've isolated the problem.
Smokescreen is in free fall.
Smokescreen, I'm opening the ground bridge directly below you.
Brace yourselves.
I'm gonna make an entrance.
He's... off course.
- You missed?
- Open another one ... fast!
I hope proper grounding on this thing doesn't apply to actual ground.
No!
Scour the wreckage!
I want those keys!
Hey, Ratchet.
I could still really use that ground bridge.
Did I tell you?
Destiny!
Alpha Trion knew I'd keep it safe.
Nice work, kid.
It was the only key in Megatron's vault.
Then three keys are accounted for.
Then the fourth is still somewhere on the Cons' warship.
Unless...
Megatron never had it to begin with?
A high-frequency signal...
with an embedded message.
Starscream.
"I have obtained something of interest to you which seems to be of no practical use to me."
- It's got to be the Omega key!
- He's the one who blindsided me!
What else could Scream be referring to?
Ep, ep!
There's more.
"Bring medical kit.
I only ask for the surgical replacement of my T-Cog in return."
Like we're gonna give scream back his wings.
Without the missing key, Cybertron will remain devoid of life.
Broken record, I know, but...
it could be a trick.
It is possible that Starscream does not yet realize the significance of what he holds.
And we do know that he's been incapable of flight for some time.
The stakes are too great for us not to consider Starscream's proposal.
However, we will take precautions.
There.
Starscream, show us the Omega key.
Give it up, Scream.
Huh?
We're too late.
The T-Cog won't help him now.
It would seem I have the run of the place.
Oh, how easy it would be to gut you.
To gut all of you.
But first thing's first.
Where does Optimus keep his key ring?
Not here.
Nope.
No.
Bleh, I was wondering what happened to that wretch.
Do they think I have all day?
Ah, there you are.
Curious.
Starscream has been deceased for quite some time.
Well, how's that possible if he just sent us a message?
We have been deceived.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- What was that?
Arcee, close the ground bridge now.
Now that I have your trinkets, I'm free to enjoy slitting your ...
But, as I appear to be pressed for time...
Autobots, maintain positions!
I'm sorry.
What was that?
You Autobots think you're so superior, but do you know what you really are?
Slow!
- The red Energon wore off, didn't it?
- He has the Omega keys!
Come on!
We'll get them back.
The keys can be of no use to Starscream while he scrounges in the wild like some scraplet.
There must be something that we can offer him in exchange.
The fate of Cybertron now rests in Starscream's hands... whatever his intention.
I beg you, my liege, release me from this absurd predicament!
No!
You shall serve as a constant reminder to those who dare fail me.
I cannot allow Optimus Prime to be the one to revive Cybertron.
We will locate the Autobot base, invade it, and retrieve the Omega keys.
Been there... done that.
Please pardon my unannounced visit, lord Megatron.
But I have come bearing a peace offering.
On the way to the bus stop, Bill saw somebody he recognized walking towards him, but he couldn't remember his name.
He began to think of things to say when they'd be close enough to acknowledge each other.
As they drew nearer, their eyes locked, uncertain if the other was gonna stop to talk.
The person greeted Bill as Bill mixed up the phrases
"What's up" with "How's it going?"
Confused, the person blurted out "Thanks"
before he knew what he was saying.
Words caught in Bill's throat and he replied, "Weh."
They did a sort of awkward half turn, and then continued on now confident that the other was not gonna stop to talk.
They never saw each other again, and a day later had each forgotten the whole thing.
Later that night, Bill sat down and put on a big sweater, but it only made him sleepy.
In the supermarket, Bill was always very careful to select fruit from only the back of the produce piles, as the fruit in the front was at crotch level to the other customers.

An old man who smelled of gasoline held up an onion and said, "Big onion," to no one in particular.

The checkout girl said, "How are you doing today?"
Bill said, "Fine, thanks, how are you?"
She didn't answer.
Bill felt used.

His calendar had a photo of a manatee on it for the month.
It always seemed as though the manatee was staring at him.
Bill sat in the living room with a giant box of crackers.
He thought some food might help him get going, but felt kind of strange eating in front of the television without having it on.
Pretty soon he was watching a boxing match on a Mexican channel.
He'd been watching a lot of boxing lately, but didn't really know why.
In the fourth round, there was an accidental head butt that split open one of the fighter's heads pretty badly.
They showed it over and over again in slow motion.
Before he knew it, Bill had eaten the entire box of crackers.
He felt really lousy and didn't want to get up.
He had a sudden urge to talk to somebody, so Bill phoned his ex-girlfriend and told her about the manatee on his calendar.
"Did you ever see the movie about the giant manatee that attacked a city?" she asked.
"I think you mean giant mantis," said Bill.
"Oh yeah," she said.

He met his ex-girlfriend during her lunch break and they took a walk to the park.
He noticed that every time he was near her, she sort of moved away with a tight-lipped smile on her face as though everything were okay.
Mostly they talked about death.
They agreed that being buried seemed too claustrophobic, and Bill didn't want to be cremated after he'd read that the intense heat boils fluids in the skull until your head explodes.
He decided that he'd want his body shot off into space in a rocket ship.
He figured it'd be too expensive to launch the weight of his entire body, but maybe just sending his head into space would be good enough, preferably in front of a little window.
His ex-girlfriend said she'd be really creeped out if she knew Bill's severed head was floating around above her in space.
Bill was given a new booklet at the clinic discussing potential memory loss in his treatment.
Inside was a cartoon character saying,
"I don't know about you folks, but I could lose my keys eating' breakfast."
His neighbor, trying to be helpful but failing, cornered Bill in the parking lot to explain how cryogenic scientists could freeze his brain in ice until a point in the future when microscopic robots could repair it.
Bill daydreamed about all the brains in jars he used to see at school, how he used to wonder whether there were still somehow pieces of individuals inside, scattered fragments of partial dreams or lost memories lodged deep within that dead tissue,
or whether this entire archive is immediately erased the moment that the body fails.
He began to think of people in a new light, how everyone's just little more than that frightened, fragile brain stem surrounded by meat and physics, too terrified to recognize the sum of their parts, insulated in the shells of their skulls
and lower middle class houses, afraid of change, afraid of decisions, afraid of pain, stuck in traffic listening to terrible music.

Last night, Bill dreamt he was young again in a field with friends at the seaside.
A big, happy seal barked at them and bounded from the water to play soccer.
He was pretty good.
It was like an animal movie.
Then the seal hit the ball a little too excited and it flew over everyone's heads and struck a little boy in an adjacent field really hard in the chest.
It seemed like maybe he had a heart condition or something because he wasn't moving.
Everyone sort of froze.
The seal retreated to the sea.
Nobody knew what to do.

At the bus stop, his left testicle ached for no apparent reason, and it almost made him feel dizzy.
Not much happened at work.
Bill made a pyramid out of three staplers, and the new guy swallowed a paperclip and was rushed out in a wheelchair.
The guy in the next cubicle over told Bill about a thing he saw on TV about identical twins who were separated at birth but had individually grown up to be serial killers.
It was as though they didn't have any choice in what they turned into.
"Genetics is pretty messed up," he said as his chewing gum flung itself from his mouth.
At lunch he told Bill about a physics book he was reading about time, how the passing of time is just an illusion because all of eternity is actually taking place at once.

He found a message on the answering machine that was sorry to inform him his mother had just died that morning.
They said she'd launched into a fit of senile hysterics after skipping her medication and was hit by a train.
She'd reserved her own funeral plot years in advance in order to be buried alongside her parents, but due to a clerical error had to be placed 50 yards away between a coffin full of rocks and a rich woman's golden retriever.
After the funeral, Bill went through her old storage boxes and was surprised to find a hundred-year-old photo album.
Among the many pictures of relatives and people he never knew were several photographs of bacon and lumber.
He also found an old series of strange portraits that had been neatly labeled for unknown future reference.

Scattered throughout the box were forgotten photos of himself as a young boy.
He'd read once how each cell in the body replaces itself and dies as the years pass;
how everyone is slowly reconstructed out of continuously changing pieces.
It depressed him how foreign the pictures seemed to him now, how his ridiculous ingrown cells had long ago stolen this happy dead kid's identity and with his own life made a complete mess of it.
Beneath the album was a folder of his mother's medical records.
Attached to her initial diagnosis was a physician's note that strongly recommended she never have a child.

He'd brushed shoulders with death on a few occasions, but in his carefree youth, it had almost seemed like an abstract, impossible thing to ever happen to him.
But with each passing decade, he began to gauge the time he probably had left, and by his 40s, what he considered his halfway point, at best, he had come to know just one thing:
you will only get older.

The next thing you know, you're looking back instead of forward, and now, at the climax of all those years of worry, sleepless nights, and denials,
Bill finally finds himself staring his death in the face surrounded by people he no longer recognizes and feels no closer attachment to than the thousands of relatives who'd come before.
And as the sun continues to set, he finally comes to realize the dumb irony in how he'd been waiting for this moment his entire life, this stupid, awkward moment of death that had invaded and distracted so many days

Bill is introduced to a new doctor and given a short interview.
He doesn't know what month it is, but he's aware he's in a hospital.
He can't remember his address, so he supposes he must have always lived here.
His vision's a little blurry and he no longer has strength in the grip of his left hand.
Bill is asked to describe a series of photographs.
He's able to put words to many of these objects but is very confused by some of the others.

He also has difficulty distinguishing the faces of people he knows.
All of these people really just look the same, and though he can recognize his ex-girlfriend because of her long hair, he can't remember her name.
He tells the doctor he has a fish living inside of his head, possibly a trout.
It'll be another night before it dawns on him that something seems missing.
All the memories the doctor asked him to recall today are suddenly out of his grasp.
So many years of faces and moments are mostly just a vague feeling now.
The years are slipping out of his head.
Yesterday, a gardener with a hose blasted all the sparrow nests from the second story awning of the building next door, raining mud and little broken eggs into the parking lot.

Another test has been arranged and Bill is taken to a white room.
A radiologist makes an incision and pushes a catheter into his femoral artery.
The catheter is carefully pushed through his stomach to his heart, up through his chest and into his head, where a special dye is introduced to flood the blood vessels in his brain for x-rays.

A powerful anesthetic is introduced to temporarily shut down the left hemisphere of his brain, and for the remaining half of Bill, the test begi--

Bill, can you tell me who this is?
Do you remember her?
Today she's joined by her boyfriend, a young man named Steve who spends most of the afternoon in the corner quietly staring at Matthew's curtain.
"I am in pain."
The doctor explains to her that Bill may be having trouble understanding past tense and present tense.
It may also be difficult for Bill to understand which of his memories are real and which are imagined.
When the brain is confronted with major memory loss, it often fills in the blanks with confabulated stories, false memories, people who never existed;
invented conclusions to make everyday life less confusing and to somehow rationalize what's happening to him.
Today, they will chat awkwardly.
Bill's been unable to stay on one subject for more than a few moments and seems to get easily frustrated.
She will say she didn't know why she'd brought Steve along yesterday and admits he'd been so shaken by the experience that he quietly cried in the car on the way home.
The sparrows have already begun to rebuild, but he's not sure if he feels happy or sad for them.
He dreams he's part of a rocket crew reentering the earth's atmosphere.
As they rapidly descend, it's believed that eating ice cream bars will help prevent them from having strokes.
As the heat intensifies, Bill eats his ice cream bar and secretly hopes that if something bad had to happen, the ship wouldn't explode, but just that everyone else would have strokes.
A final battery of tests are ordered to positively rule out the chance of surgery.
Highly drugged, Bill will have no memory of these tests other than a terrible noise to his right and a brief vision of a seahorse and a falling tree.

She'd reserved her own funeral plot years in advance in order to be buried alongside her parents, but due to a clerical error had to be placed 50 yards away between a coffin full of rocks and a rich woman's golden retriever.
After the funeral, Bill went through her old storage boxes and was surprised to find a hundred-year-old photo album.
Among the many pictures of relatives and people he never knew were several photographs of bacon and lumber.
He also found an old series of strange portraits that had been neatly labeled for unknown future reference.

Scattered throughout the box were forgotten photos of himself as a young boy.

Today she's joined by her boyfriend, a young man named Steve who spends most of the afternoon in the corner quietly staring at Matthew's curtain.

The doctor explains to her that Bill may be having trouble understanding past tense and present tense.
It may also be difficult for Bill to understand which of his memories are real and which are imagined.
When the brain is confronted with major memory loss, it often fills in the blanks with confabulated stories, false memories, people who never existed;
invented conclusions to make everyday life less confusing and to somehow rationalize what's happening to him.
Today, they will chat awkwardly.
Bill's been unable to stay on one subject for more than a few moments and seems to get easily frustrated.
She will say she didn't know why she'd brought Steve along yesterday and admits he'd been so shaken by the experience that he quietly cried in the car on the way home.

In the morning, Bill felt really tired even though he'd just been sleeping.
His calendar had a photo of a manatee on it for the month.
It always seemed as though the manatee was staring at him.
Bill sat in the living room with a giant box of crackers.
He thought some food might help him get going, but felt kind of strange eating in front of the television without having it on.
Pretty soon he was watching a boxing match on a Mexican channel.
He'd been watching a lot of boxing lately, but didn't really know why.
In the fourth round, there was an accidental head butt that split open one of the fighter's heads pretty badly.
They showed it over and over again in slow motion.
Before he knew it, Bill had eaten the entire box of crackers.
He felt really lousy and didn't want to get up.
He had a sudden urge to talk to somebody, so Bill phoned his ex-girlfriend and told her about the manatee on his calendar.
"Did you ever see the movie about the giant manatee that attacked a city?" she asked.
"I think you mean giant mantis," said Bill.

He met his ex-girlfriend during her lunch break and they took a walk to the park.
He noticed that every time he was near her, she sort of moved away with a tight-lipped smile on her face as though everything were okay.
Mostly they talked about death.
They agreed that being buried seemed too claustrophobic, and Bill didn't want to be cremated after he'd read that the intense heat boils fluids in the skull until your head explodes.
He decided that he'd want his body shot off into space in a rocket ship.
He figured it'd be too expensive to launch the weight of his entire body, but maybe just sending his head into space would be good enough, preferably in front of a little window.
His ex-girlfriend said she'd be really creeped out if she knew Bill's severed head was floating around above her in space.
Bill was given a new booklet at the clinic discussing potential memory loss in his treatment.
Inside was a cartoon character saying,
"I don't know about you folks, but I could lose my keys eating' breakfast."
His neighbor, trying to be helpful but failing, cornered Bill in the parking lot to explain how cryogenic scientists could freeze his brain in ice until a point in the future when microscopic robots could repair it.
Bill daydreamed about all the brains in jars he used to see at school, how he used to wonder whether there were still somehow pieces of individuals inside, scattered fragments of partial dreams or lost memories lodged deep within that dead tissue,
or whether this entire archive is immediately erased the moment that the body fails.
He began to think of people in a new light, how everyone's just little more than that frightened, fragile brain stem surrounded by meat and physics, too terrified to recognize the sum of their parts, insulated in the shells of their skulls
and lower middle class houses, afraid of change, afraid of decisions, afraid of pain, stuck in traffic listening to terrible music.

His neighbor stared at him and said,

The doctor explains to her that Bill may be having trouble understanding past tense and present tense.
It may also be difficult for Bill to understand which of his memories are real and which are imagined.
When the brain is confronted with major memory loss, it often fills in the blanks with confabulated stories, false memories, people who never existed;

Bill's been unable to stay on one subject for more than a few moments and seems to get easily frustrated.

An older guy in a baseball cap stands at a payphone and nervously lifts and hangs up the receiver.
He asks to borrow Bill's pencil and then places a call to his daughter.
He tells her he loves her and he's proud of her, and that "one day soon, we'll finally have our day."
Then he says, "Fantastic, fantastic,"
and hangs up the phone.
Although it looks like the wind had been knocked out of him, he presents the pencil back to Bill with a little flourish, as though proud no harm had come to it while in his possession.
He dreams of fog on the dark edge of a cliff where hundreds of feet below the deep sea swells up against the rocks.
And if you lean over the edge and squint your eyes just right, you can barely make out the gray shapes of all the cars that had driven off the cliff over the years sunken deep beneath the surface.
And as each wave washes slowly over them, the undertow quietly pulls their headlights on and off, on and off on an endless loop growing slowly dimmer over the years until the day comes that they fade completely.

Woman:
I've been concerned any improvement is likely a placebo effect.
Was Tom Kane admitted to your clinic?
I need to know.
Yes.
We treated him.
That bag you dropped was light at least five grand.
- Mayor Rutledge is in the hospital.
- How can I help?
Emma is upset.
I want you to take her home.
You're stronger than this.
Had you previously been unfaithful?
I'm not going to answer that question.
Don't you think we deserve to know who our elected officials are?
I made a fucking mistake.
When I become the next governor, you and I will seldom coincide legislatively or otherwise.
We are fast approaching the annual vote to cover the city's expenditures.
There can be no push-back.
It pains me to be the bearer of bad news.
Is this really the legacy you want to leave behind, Mac?
Allowing the state's largest city to go under?
This bond acquisition vote provides you an opportunity to stimulate a wind of change.
Sacrifice the castle to take down the king.
Castles can be rebuilt.
Men cannot.
Woman:
Voting will now begin.
Alderman Ross?
Ross:
I vote nay.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

With a tally of 41 nays, this measure is denied.

I fully expect you to lock him up before I hand this slam-fucking-dunk case over to the Feds.

Time.
I want it.
Mac:
Don't have it to give, Tom.
While I appreciate you coming to Springfield in your off-hours to ask, there's nothing I can do.
Financial chicanery could have lasted only so long.
And it's to your credit that for over a decade it did.
But without the state bonds, without your own council's support, the city is about to default on some hefty loans.
Who do you think you are?
I've called for an emergency manager.
The advance team will be there...
Who the fuck do you think you are?
The governor of the goddamn state, that's who.
You...
have no idea.
How is he?
I'm not sure you have the right to know.
Excuse me?
I spoke to his nurse.
Nadeem, I believe.
He suggested you could have had something to do with it.
That, for whatever reason, you may have withheld your grandfather's medication, causing him to fall.
Is that what you call it?
Medication?
The doctors can't say if he'll ever come out of the coma.
Hard enough seeing him live through a stroke.
You mean the one that you caused?
Sorry?
His stupor.
It didn't just happen.
It was induced.
And you kept him that way with all the bulbocapnine you keep giving him.
- I don't understand what you're suggesting.
- Why did you do it?
For his money?
For his power?
For your husband?
Oh!
- ( Screams ) - ( Groans )
Borden.
B-O-R-D-E-N?
Great.
Thanks.
Credit reports, disciplinary actions if any, who his family members are...
that's what I need.
- A real background check.
- Got it.
Sussing out a source or a date?
This detective I met with called, said he had information for me.
Might be moot.
Cullen's named an emergency manager.
The city's days from defaulting on its financial obligations.
When it does, Elizabeth Borden takes over.
The attorney who whipped Detroit into shape?
- Ran it for over a year.
- ( Knocks )
Mayor's cutting after-school programs to bridge the budget gap.
Nice.
How's he gonna pay for the other five billion?
Exactly.
If Kane can't stop the bleeding,
Borden's gonna take him down before you do.
They're here.
Hard up in a clinch and no knife to cut the seizing.
How many?
Dozens.
- When can we expect you in?
- Soon.
Kill all residential streetlights.
Doyle:
Let this message be heard.
Corruption, political or financial, will not be tolerated by my office.
Take a couple questions.
( Reporters clamoring )
- Morning.
- Morning.
Reporter: ...was taken into custody outside his Gold Coast penthouse.
He was a necessary evil, but known and without association.
I'll make the call.
Even my father had to ask for this type of help from time to time.
How is he, by the way, the old man?
Unchanged.
Emma, however, is becoming increasingly unstable.
And made accusations last night about the stroke.
She got physical.
Tom, I want her out of this house.
Reporter:
Will it be enough to keep the city from going under?
If not, the public wants to know what's next.
I would ask that you endure for a few more days.
How long... before they try and wrest it from you?
( Elevator bell rings )
( Voices overlapping )
Sir, we're ready in your office.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Our phone lines are flooded with complaints about the closures.
Parents, teachers, conservancy groups, park and rec workers.
Temporary inconveniences which must be abided.
Sacrifices must be made, particularly in those wards which don't provide enough tax revenue.
Ian:
Nonexistent in the 21st.
Then shutter its day care facilities, shelters, and community centers.
Sir, I understand your hostility towards Alderman Ross, but his ward's already stretched in terms of public services.
And he no longer has to provide them to residents of Lennox Gardens, because there are none.
At the moment.
I'll notify DFSS about shuttering those agencies right away.
Smaller measures like these can help, but, with all due respect, they're a drop in the bucket given the city's deficit.
What we really need is a federal bailout.
Which is why I want you in DC.
I need you to push for TARP funds.
Get the Treasury to buy our debt.
That's just what I was about to suggest.
Take the next plane out.
I'll make some calls, get you in front of the right people.
Yes, sir.
Ian, it was a bit chilly when last I visited the conference room.
Make our guests more comfortable.
It was sound advice and I took it.
To great success, as it turns out.
Congratulations on that McGantry arrest, by the way.
Timing could have been better.
We barely made it one news cycle before the budget crisis became a bigger headline.
True, but it's all of one piece... fall of the status quo, ascendency of new leadership.
What can I do for you, Mr. Zajac?
Double down.
Help me further separate myself from Tom Kane by providing your full power of your field operations.
Got to love a man with confidence.
Doyle:
If he gets wind of this...
In a few days, he's a nonissue.
City goes broke, it'll be up for grabs.
Pretty big takedown.
His biggest PAC contributor for years.
He must have done something huge to piss Kane off this much.
Like contribute to my campaign.
Might not have been Kane's play.
God knows the State's Attorney will do anything to get into the papers.
No, I'm pretty sure Doyle got this handed to him on a silver platter.
Kitty, you give your old boss way too much credit.
And anyway, McGantry is yesterday's news.
Today is all about the fact that Chicago's been run into the ground by the bad guys.
We're ready.
In here.
And you work for the good guys now.
Mona:
Have a driver meet me at the gate.
I've got my RFP responses here, but I need my PowerPoint overnighted.
I'll call you from the cab.
( Inhales )
Good a time as any to leave town.
I'm flying to DC, trying to mitigate some of the damage you've done.
It's not my fault the city can't meet its obligations on loan interests.
Kane's been working this Ponzi scheme for years.
By the time the receiver gets it straight, his term's over, and you're out of a job.
Should have stuck with Mr. Ross here.
FYI, if Borden takes over, your boss loses, too.
Unlike our mayor, I can rise again.
Seems like your name may not be worth so much after all.
( Dogs barking )
No.
No.
No.
No!
No!
No!
You can't fucking do this!
Fuck you!
Fucking bitch!
Let me out!
Sweat it out, bastards.
The city has a pension payment tomorrow of over half a million dollars.
We could save that by shutting down select transit lines between 7:00 P.M. And 5:00 a.m.
It'll buy us some time, anyway.
Do it, but don't spare rush hour.
Not a cut the public will respond well to.
Perhaps you should make a statement.
Last thing I want to do is become the official face of this crisis when it is the council that is wholly to blame.
I just wish some informed insider would say the same to the press.
Sir?
You heard me.
Man:
After all these years,
I can't believe I've never seen your home.
( Chuckles ) We don't entertain here often.
Well, this is a special occasion, then.
( Clinks glasses )
John, my husband's trust isn't easily earned.
I've noticed.
My family's made more than one overture.
Yeah.
But at the moment,
Chicago is experiencing financial difficulties.
And you see an opportunity.
I do.
Does the mayor even know that I'm here?
( Laughs ) He does.
- But this was your idea?
- Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Well, allow me to be the first Vacarro to contribute to Tom Kane's PAC.
John, now is not the time to think small.

I need you.

- If you are satisfied with your message...
Protesters:
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
Mr. Todd!
Mr. Todd!
Any comment on the deficit that stands to bankrupt the city?
Um, yes.
I do, actually.
Having worked with several council members,
I'm struck by the lack of responsibility being taken by its leadership in this crisis.
No less than a month ago, all 50 aldermen approved pay raises for themselves.
But when the mayor needed help in balancing the budget, they refused.
Now they're off the radar while public services are cut, citizens suffer, and an emergency manager with a six-figure salary is appointed.
Where's the democracy in that?
Excuse me.
( Chanting continues ) No more cutbacks!
What qualifies someone, do you suppose, to run a city?
Mr. Kane, out of respect for your position,
I came here after hours so as not to cause any...
Did you study law?
Economics?
Get elected?
My team is here to ensure a smooth transition of power.
The fact is, no matter how much money you move around or how many light switches you turn off or jobs you eliminate, the city will default.
And because that is the reality of the situation,
I wanted to give you the opportunity to speak with your unions before I cut pensions and cancel contracts.
Do you really think
I'd allow the likes of you to take this from me?
A bean counter?
A shyster?
Someone who has more regard for the almighty dollar than the people of this city.
Short of a miracle, I'll be back in two days.
I'll see you then.
Hope to be your next governor.
Your campaign's been on quite a roller coaster.
With the positive press you've gotten since your mea culpa interview, think you still have a shot at winning the office?
Absolutely.
Because I still care about Illinois.
Which is why I didn't approve the mayor's request for a state-funded bailout.
Thank you.
Mr. Kane's played a big part in your candidacy.
- Has that changed?
- Well, he knows, as State Treasurer,
I have a fiscal responsibility to each and every taxpayer.
So in good conscience I can't saddle them with a debt incurred in a single city.
And how are the people of Chicago supposed to feel about that?
Well, they should be angry.
And I don't blame them.
They shouldn't have to feel the pain of mismanagement.
And people can think what they want about me personally, but my record will show I have tremendous fiscal discipline.
Hi, how are you?
Thank you so much.
Good to meet you.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.
Good.
- Thank you so much for your support.
- Nice to see you again.
Yes, great to see you.
Thank you for your support.
Thank you so much for your support.
Let's wrap this up, okay?
Thanks, folks.
See you at the polls.
City's closing this line down anyway.
What you're suggesting is unprecedented.
Worked for the auto industry.
That was corporate.
You are talking about using TARP funds to buy up municipal debt.
The mayor's hoping the Treasury will be pragmatic.
We go down, it's not just Chicago that feels the pain.
Not pragmatic to open the door, allowing every distressed city to claim our limited funds.
Illinois' 20 electoral votes.
It is unclear that a weakened Kane can deliver that.
Can we get the mayor on the phone with the secretary to discuss our proposal?
Why don't you just fucking roll over and die?
Sorry, I told him...
Nice to see you, too, William.
You want this city to suffer, at least have the decency to spread it around, not just gut my ward, which as you know, don't have much to begin with.
- Why?
- Why what?
This?
Don't you care about your constituents?
The people you were elected to serve?
Do you want to see them at the mercy of an outsider?
As opposed to you?
You are not that petty or stupid.
( Chuckles )
Your time has come.
Our time.
Years of bloody battle between us, now we both lose to a third party.
You're the one who pushed it over the edge.
With that.
That, Alderman... can save us both.
- ( Music playing on radio ) - ( Phone ringing )
Hey, Roxie.
A little bit of this for a little bit of that?
It's Meredith Kane.
How are you?
Mac:
I'm just fine.
Thanks for asking.
Funny you should call.
The wife asked about you just last night.
Oh, give my best to Edie.
Mac, I know you're busy, but if at all possible,
I'd love to meet you for lunch.
- You here in Springfield?
- No, in Chicago.
But I could have you flown in on a friend's private jet.
We could chat.
Last time we did resulted in a steep National Guard bill.
No, this won't cost a thing.
I'll have you back in Springfield in a couple of hours.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
Never pass on a free lunch.
( Chuckles ) Wonderful.
I'll see you soon.
You really do smooth out my rough edges, don't you?
( Door creaks, bangs )
Hello?
You weren't lying when you said someplace out of the way.
Well, I can't be too careful with the goods that I got.
I like the sound of that.
Your suspicions about Ezra Stone are not unfounded.
Meaning it was an inside job.
Gotta be some terms here if you want the full story.
You know, last time I saw you, you were barside with Kane's pal from the O'Hare ceremony.
Kind of seemed like you guys were part of the same fan club.
Past tense.
Look, CPD's been doing Kane's dirty work for years.
Then he turns around and scrapes Royczyk like shit from his shoe.
Now he's eyeballing our pension funds to keep the city from going belly up.
You'll go on record?
For 10,000 bucks.
We don't pay for stories.
Well, you don't get 'em this good, either.
What, toxic waste in Bensenville?
Please.
The "Sentinel" is a paper of record, detective Dinovo, not a tabloid.
Yeah, and I'm a man without retirement pay who needs to leave town if I go public.
I'd say 10 grand was a bargain.
Take it or leave it.
There's more to tell.
( Door slams )
( Muffled voices speaking within ) ...that's not what she said to me...
Hey, I don't blame you.
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Mr. Taylor.
Come here, man.
It's good to see you, man.
- It's good to be seen.
- Yeah.
How you doing?
Fine now that charges against me got dropped.
I'm grateful for everything you did in that regard.
You kept your head when you were in custody.
That kind of loyalty is something I very much value.
Of course it is.
So the Gardens are done for a while, but I'd imagine you still need some help in the field.
I understand young brother covered for me while I was gone, but...
Trey, go down the hall, get us some ice.
I want to fix the ward boss a drink, catch him up on things.
Trey:
All right.
Kenya:
How your family, man?
Everybody good?
Everybody's good.
You had sex with Treasurer Zajac?
Oral.
In his office.
That part was okay with me.
But then he eliminated my internship, which was way not okay.
And when I saw him on the street, he pretended he didn't know me.
( Scoffs )
Wow.
He's just a hypocrite, telling people he's only had one affair.
It's a lie.
Patty, I get why you want to hold him accountable.
I do.
It's a completely healthy reaction.
But if you go public with this, you will be savaged.
You will be painted as a slut.
He will deny it, say you're delusional, and everyone will believe him.
Don't throw your future away on this.
He's not worth it.
I really thought you'd be on my side.
I need a breakdown ward by ward.
Get me the southeast first.
I am.
Just sleep on this, okay?
Give it some thought.
Call me tomorrow and we'll talk about it.
Okay.
So what was that all about?
Oh, she used to work for Zajac.
She's looking for a new job, but we don't have any space for her.
Getting too old for this shit.
Description, location, compensation.
Tonight.
I'm meeting with Senator Carter later.
If we can get assurances that banking won't go after them, maybe we can get the Fed to help.
Good, keep at it.
How are things going there?
A day from shutting down schools.
I'll keep you posted.
You may be my only hope.
Mac's quite affable, though he and my husband have had their moments.
Which is why you're here and not the mayor himself.
As you can imagine, he's quite busy.
And I do play a role.
Oh, it's quite clear how much political power you have, Meredith.
( Chuckles )
( Laughs ) Mac.
A fella could get used to this.
Mac, this is John Vacarro.
John, Mac Cullen.
So, what's for lunch?
( Laughs ) Let's go.
John:
I'm not much of a gambler myself, but the track has proven to be a solid investment.
People seem to enjoy it.
Bought it several years ago.
Put in a global pari-mutuel betting system.
Been a moneymaker ever since.
Very nice.
As is the box.
Nothing quite like it in Springfield.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Kane.
Meredith, are you all right?
Yeah, I just needed to sit for a second.
Shall we cut to the chase before the horses do?
Absolutely.
McGantry's property surrounding Lennox Gardens.
- Now owned by the state.
- Go on.
I buy it at market value plus 5%.
Do you?
Shouldn't that be phrased as a question, Mr. Vacarro?
- ( Meredith chuckles )
- We both know market value these days is a turd with a price tag.
Three years ago, McGantry bought that same real estate for a hell of a lot more than that.
That was then, Mac.
And this is now, I suppose.
We take the guarantee to the banks as collateral for emergency loans.
You come out looking like the savior of Chicago.
Jesus.
Someone get me a pair of tights and a cape.
- Is that my new identity since the riots?
- Meredith:
Why not?
Think I'll get a chance to place a bet before I have to go?
Meme.
- ( Car approaching ) - ( Speaking softly )
( Music playing within )
Hey, hey.
Hard man to find, huh, cuz?
Just been working in different places, man.
Hmm, sound about right.
You wouldn't be thinking of running off on me now, would you?
I will find you.
I ain't going nowhere, bro.
I'm just building my business back up.
I got a little now if you want it.
The fuck is that?
( Chuckles ) 5K is some serious paper, man.
And I ain't got 10 years to wait on you.
Have all my money today or we got issues.
You know I ain't got that shit, man.
Hey, look, tell me something, man.
Really.
That little white girl worth all this?
Man, I'm done with that bitch.
Look at the man.
He done with her... and yet the debt remains.
So tell me, what we gonna do about that?
What's up with the Zajac volunteer?
Oh, she was inexperienced.
We don't need her.
You're lying.
Why?
I'm not.
If another one's come out of the woodwork, why aren't we running with it?
Catherine, it's gilding the lily.
Tina:
Not when he's trending up.
Proof that it was more than one affair could finish him.
If you've got something on Zajac, I want it.
So either he banged the fat chick or she's mad he didn't bang her.
Which is it?
She's just a kid, okay?
If we go public...
This is my fourth run.
I don't give a shit about collateral damage.
But the meeting was set.
- He can't see you.
I'm sorry.
- Can't or won't?
Carter's been waiting 15 years to get the gavel on banking.
He's not gonna give it up for this.
He owes his career to Kane.
You think he can get by without Cook County next primary?
Look, everyone's watching Walsh/Zajac and thinking maybe Kane's finally irrelevant.
She wins, his pull evaporates.
People forget a fundamental truth.
Tom Kane always finds a way.
The further you back him into a corner, the more painful the cuts when he fights his way out.
I'm sorry.
( Sighs )
After all this, I'm getting no?
( Laughs ) Welcome to politics.
You might wish you'd stayed out.
Thanks, you two, but I need to get going.
Need to check in with Borden before it gets too late.
- Sorry you couldn't stay longer, Governor.
- Ah.
With only a few months left in office,
I'm sure Mac wants to make the most of them.
Tell Tom I wish him the best with this thing.
I really do.
Will do.
Which way to the jet?
( Dial tone beeping )
( Ringing )
Tom:
Tell me.
He's not on board.
They say a mule will labor 10 years willingly and patiently for the privilege of kicking you just once.
He wants more than that.
Yeah.
Speak later.
Payroll for sanitation won't be met without more cuts.
At this point, we're at mandated furloughs for nonessential city workers.
- Any word from Mona?
- Nothing encouraging.
Sir, is it possible that... will we lose control of the city?
I want this delivered by hand... to Governor Cullen.
I believe Governor Cullen is out of the office until tomorrow.
Then deliver it as soon as possible,
God damn it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Mayor, just thought you should know, the emergency manager is meeting with her advance team in the conference room.
10% across-the-board layoffs aren't enough.
We'll need at least 18.
It has not been two days.
You are interlopers here because of my hospitality.
I want you to leave now.
First off, this advance team is here by order of the state.
- And in 24 hours...
- Get out!
You!
You're postponing the inevitable.
She's wrong.
( Bushes rustling )
- Are you out of your mind?
- I wanted to see you.
Here, in the middle of nowhere, after not calling me for days?
Yeah, I know I've been out of touch.
No word, no explanation.
Nothing.
Kane has a brain disease.
I was tracking that before Rosebud came along.
Reason I was over the border when you called?
That's where he was during the riots... an experimental treatment center just outside of Toronto.
My gut says that Stone knew about the illness as well, saw that Kane was unfit for office, so he leaks the Bensenville story under the name Rosebud.
Kane ultimately finds out about it and kills him for it.
The burglary gone bad, which every other paper in town seems so ready to print...
I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it.
Now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him.
- We've got Kane by the balls.
- We?
Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone.
I did not.
I told you it may be Stone.
May be.
And I told you, Sam.
No one else.
So don't even fucking think about using my name, okay?
Look, he can't touch you from a prison cell.
That's exactly where he's going.
You think Kane is blinded by ambition?
You may want to take a look in the mirror.
Oh, Jesus.
Fucking me isn't enough?
Now you're gonna analyze me?
Excuse me?
Wow.
Look, I didn't mean that.
Don't use my name.
I'm gonna use your name anyway.
You'll be subpoenaed.
Do it.
I'll deny everything.
Oh, and by the way...
fuck you!
Tina:
You know, you just...
you can't trust her.
I think we can.
Defending that kid today was a big move for her as a person.
Since when do you give a damn about Kitty as a person?
Take it easy.
Good news is, we want another Zajac scandal, we got it.
Yeah, no thanks to her.
- I need a cigarette.
- No, you don't.
Sit down.
Sit down.
She knows people, so what?
She does.
You know me.
I'll be back in a minute.
Senator Walsh?
Just wanted to say congratulations on your campaign.
Voted for you every election.
Well, thank you so much.
Let's see if we can make it to the governor's office this time, huh?
- Yeah.
- Thanks again.
( Knocks )
Are you planning on leaving soon?
- No.
- Would you mind if I...
Go home.
Would you like me to arrange for your car to...
It's a sailor's term for being overtaken by misfortune.
"Hard up in a clinch and no knife to cut the seizing."
I'm not going anywhere.
You're dismissed.
Yes, sir.
( Sighs )
Where's Trey?
I don't know, man.
But he asked me to talk to you...
To what?
Waste my fucking time?
A few weeks in a suit and he's a player now?
Tell him...
Hold up, nigga.
I'm here to tell you something, man.
- That right?
- He wants you gone, right?
So we got one way you can do it, or we got another.
( Laughing )
Are you serious?
You think you can just get up in my car and threaten me?
I'm trying to do you a favor here, bro.
And I'm gonna do you one by not punching you in your goddamn face.
Get the fuck out.
If you don't do this, he'll kill us both, man.
- I promise you that.
- I ain't scared of that motherfucker.
- And sure as hell ain't scared of you.
- Keep talking.
Give me a goddamn break.
Think I don't know who you are?
Huh?
Darius, the one who's been banging Kane's daughter.
- Shut the fuck up!
- What's this, some kind of joke, man?
Trey trying to punk me out with this shit?
Send me some weak-ass, punk-ass, bitch-made puss...
( Alarm ringing )
Okay, we got to get ready.
They're picking us up in 30 minutes.
Okay?
Whew...
Come on, lazy girl.
Come on, Tina.
Come on, you...
Tina?
Tina!
Tina!
( Coughs, stammers )
I need medical help!
Now!
Tina.
Sweetheart.
Tina.
( Crying ) Tina.
Tina.
Tina.
Can we say "dead lesbian"?
EMT hinted it was a drug overdose, maybe ketamine.
What about Walsh?
Anybody know if she was under the influence?
Or should we just write, "Woman found naked in her bed"?
Where the hell is Miller?
He's not answering his phone.
Track down that EMT.
You, don't say lesbian.
Or ketamine.
"Dead woman found in hotel room with Walsh, possible overdose."
I'm going to the hotel.
Reporter:
Breaking news...
Senator Walsh's top aide was found dead early this morning in the senator's hotel room.
We're going now live to the scene.
- Was it an overdose?
- What was your relationship?
Were you doing drugs with her?
Why are you afraid to come out of the closet?
Is your campaign now over?
- Are you a lesbian?
- How long have you known the deceased?
Senator Walsh... senator can you tell us, are you dropping out of the race?
Was she just your lover?
Is it true you were in bed together?
Ma'am, how long have you been lovers?
Senator Walsh, did you love her?
( Reporters clamoring )
Is your campaign over?
What's the best look for taking over a city?
Stripes read serious.
I don't know why everyone's so surprised.
Worst-kept secret in Springfield,
Walsh being a muff diver.
This just came for you from Mayor Kane's office.
( Chuckles ) Last pitch for clemency?
Humph.
What is it?
Get the mayor on the line.
( Knocking on door )
Why didn't you answer?
Why didn't you call?
- This is dangerous, what we're doing.
- They won't know.
This isn't about your parents.
It's about you.
- Are you okay?
- I confronted her about everything.
We have to get you out of here.
What, do you think I want to stay?
Tell me.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Well, what if your father negotiated a deal with the State's Attorney?
You'd have to plead guilty.
Emma, listen to me.
You'd have to play the part.
I'm not one of their employees.
I don't have to eat their shit.
You're right.
So forget about what you have to do.
What do you want?
I want them to pay for everything.
So put on a dress, paste on a smile, and take the long...
The long view?
He'll be dead soon.
What?
Lewy Body Dementia.
Maybe that's justice enough.
You... you won't tell anyone?
You can't.
Of course not.
Reporter:
More layoffs are planned as the city's economic picture worsens.
Governor Cullen is said to be en route to City Hall where he's expected to make an announcement.
Elizabeth Borden, the emergency manager appointed by the governor, could not be reached for comment , but observers expect her
- to join the governor for that briefing.
- ( Phone ringing )
( Ringing )
Anything at all?
Sir, I wasn't able to...
I'm sorry.
I'm on my way in from the airport.
Don't bother coming in.
I want to.
Suit yourself.
Ross:
No, everything's about to change.
In fact, hell's about to freeze over.
I've got to go.
We heard from Kenya?
Hasn't come by, hasn't called.
This motherfucker gonna miss out on all the fireworks.
What brought you out here today?
They closed the day care.
I work all day.
Where am I supposed to put my children?
The city's on edge as the deadline approaches for Mayor Kane...
They got here this morning before I did.
What do you think he's doing about all this?
No idea.
All I know is how he spent the night.
He come out at all?
Make or take any calls?
One from the governor, that's it.
( Phone rings )
Yes?
Cullen's on his way up.
We'll need the briefing room.
Please do what you can to make it look presentable.
Thank you.
This is it.
You gonna let him know this is going down?
Get the press room ready.
Sir?
Excuse me for interrupting.
I wish City Hall was a taller building.
Or closer to the water.
Be nice to see the lake.
The governor's arrived.
Presumably to hand control to Miss Borden.
Some believe you think more clearly near water.
Have you heard that?
Mr. Mayor, I cannot express to you strongly enough the urgency of the situation.
I don't want to see you surrender.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Kane:
Good man.
Another day.
( Raps ) Ready?
Emma, please.
I don't feel well.
I know.
Brought you some tea.
I'm sorry.
You were right.
I have been using again.
Made me a little crazy, I guess.
But keeping me in my room kind of forced me to get sober.
And I'm glad.
And I'm gonna be good now, Mom, I promise.
Good.
I heard on the radio there's a press conference.
What's going on?
I don't know exactly.
Kane's in with Cullen.
Do you have anything?
Should I stop them?
No, we're radioactive.
Ross is here.
Fucking vulture.
I'm almost there.
Hurry, they're about to start.
- I haven't seen Borden go in yet.
You?
- No.
What's he doing here?
We've suffered together.
Tightened our belts.
Made sacrifices.
We can tolerate no more.
And we don't have to.
Along with my colleague in the council Alderman William Ross and entrepreneur John Vacarro, we have put together a coalition of leaders from both business and government to build a dazzling complex on the grounds formerly known as Lennox Gardens.
A project to revitalize the city and bring in tremendous revenues, licensing fees, jobs, and tourism.
I present to you The Gardens Convention Center and Casino.
( Crowd murmuring )
Projected income...
$2.6 billion in the first five years, 1.1 billion in taxes.
A crucial percentage going towards schools, libraries, parks, streets, transportation.
Because of our coalition, we are in receipt of this letter of credit allowing the city to borrow against the promise of this epic venture.
And who better to oversee such an undertaking than outgoing governor Mac Cullen, who will serve as chairman for the Chicago Gaming Authority at the end of his tenure.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back in business.
( Applause )
Now there are many, of course, behind the scenes who helped bring this project to fruition.
But I would like to thank one in particular.
One who has been a tireless advocate and a driving force in the redevelopment of Lennox Gardens.
Mona Fredricks.
( Applause )
Got a hit on this aged-up Boetker photo.
This was less than a mile from the site of the shooting.
Only partial plates.
I assume you're running them now.
So I would ask that you come back to me with the full story, Detective.
Seems the budget crisis is over.
Reporter:
Public response to the mayor's casino plan has been largely positive.
With the promise of this large a cash infusion over the course of the next several years, several banks have agreed to provide low-interest loans and the emergency manager has been sent packing.
( TV off )
A goddamn casino.
With everything that implies.
Well, now we know why he wanted us to prosecute Babe McGantry.
Kane just sold the land we seized.
I took the fucking bait for this lawyered-up piece of shit.
Fucking fuck!
Yes?
What is it?
Ian:
I just... very well played, sir.
( Chuckles )
And I can't begin to tell you what an honor it is to be in your service.
Well, considering the way things went today, that could be the case for a long time to come.
I certainly hope so.
And suddenly he's the messiah.
He's untouchable now, Sam.
You know that, don't you?
You all right?
I don't know what I am any more.
I'm assuming that they weren't into recreational drugs...
Walsh and...
Tina.
I heard it was probably ketamine.
Is it possible?
Could he be that evil?
Could he have done this?
Can't imagine it was anyone else.
Catherine wasn't going to work for him.
Ever.
See, that's what I don't get.
I was still in this race.
I could have won it on my own.
Not what he wanted.
And you weren't gonna win, Ben.
We all but bought Cook County.
What'll she do?
Walsh.
Open a homicide investigation.
Not much else she can do.
You're gonna be the next governor.
He owns you.
Kane:
There you are.
So, what do you want to do?
You know what I want.
Not this.
What do you want to do now?
Those TARP funds you had me chasing, we were never gonna get them, were we?
You just wanted me out of the way so you could do this.
You have a daughter, yes?
Mine's 10.
It always mattered very much to me that she was proud... of me.
What I do.
And yet, I'm still here.
So I must be lying to someone.
And what about you?
Who are you lying to?
There was no political upside to the promises you made.
So either you give a shit and you pussied out, or you're a motherfucking lunatic!
( Snaps ) Which is it, Tom?
Your naiveté was charming for a time,
Ms. Fredricks.
Even enchanting.
I wondered what it would feel like to bask in the admiration of someone so pure of intent.
It was nice.
But now I know.
Don't bother to collect your things.
I'll have someone send them along.
Oh, and give my best to Bitsy.
I'm sure she's very proud of you.
Miss.
- Yes?
- If you wouldn't mind.
What is this about?
Doyle:
Get in!
Now!
I've been concerned any improvement is likely a placebo effect.
Was Tom Kane admitted to your clinic?
I need to know.
Yes.
We treated him.
That bag you dropped was light at least five grand.
- Mayor Rutledge is in the hospital.
- How can I help?
Emma is upset.
I want you to take her home.
You're stronger than this.
Had you previously been unfaithful?
I'm not going to answer that question.
Don't you think we deserve to know who our elected officials are?
I made a fucking mistake.
When I become the next governor, you and I will seldom coincide legislatively or otherwise.
We are fast approaching the annual vote to cover the city's expenditures.
There can be no push-back.
It pains me to be the bearer of bad news.
Is this really the legacy you want to leave behind, Mac?
Allowing the state's largest city to go under?
This bond acquisition vote provides you an opportunity to stimulate a wind of change.
Sacrifice the castle to take down the king.
Castles can be rebuilt.
Men cannot.
Voting will now begin.
Alderman Ross?
I vote nay.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
With a tally of 41 nays, this measure is denied.
McGantry, everything you need you have.
I fully expect you to lock him up before I hand this slam-fucking-dunk case over to the Feds.

Time.
I want it.
Don't have it to give, Tom.
While I appreciate you coming to Springfield in your off-hours to ask, there's nothing I can do.
Financial chicanery could have lasted only so long.
And it's to your credit that for over a decade it did.
But without the state bonds, without your own council's support, the city is about to default on some hefty loans.
Who do you think you are?
I've called for an emergency manager.
The advance team will be there...
Who the fuck do you think you are?
The governor of the goddamn state, that's who.
You...
have no idea.
How is he?
I'm not sure you have the right to know.
Excuse me?
I spoke to his nurse.
Nadeem, I believe.
He suggested you could have had something to do with it.
That, for whatever reason, you may have withheld your grandfather's medication, causing him to fall.
Is that what you call it?
Medication?
The doctors can't say if he'll ever come out of the coma.
Hard enough seeing him live through a stroke.
You mean the one that you caused?
Sorry?
His stupor.
It didn't just happen.
It was induced.
And you kept him that way with all the bulbocapnine you keep giving him.
- I don't understand what you're suggesting.
- Why did you do it?
For his money?
For his power?
For your husband?
Borden.
B-O-R-D-E-N?
Great.
Thanks.
Credit reports, disciplinary actions if any, who his family members are...
that's what I need.
- A real background check.
- Got it.
Sussing out a source or a date?
This detective I met with called, said he had information for me.
Might be moot.
Cullen's named an emergency manager.
The city's days from defaulting on its financial obligations.
When it does, Elizabeth Borden takes over.
The attorney who whipped Detroit into shape?
Ran it for over a year.
Mayor's cutting after-school programs to bridge the budget gap.
Nice.
How's he gonna pay for the other five billion?
Exactly.
If Kane can't stop the bleeding,
Borden's gonna take him down before you do.
They're here.
Hard up in a clinch and no knife to cut the seizing.
How many?
Dozens.
- When can we expect you in?
- Soon.
Kill all residential streetlights.
Let this message be heard.
Corruption, political or financial, will not be tolerated by my office.
Take a couple questions.
- Morning.
- Morning.
...was taken into custody outside his Gold Coast penthouse.
He was a necessary evil, but known and without association.
I'll make the call.
Even my father had to ask for this type of help from time to time.
How is he, by the way, the old man?
Unchanged.
Emma, however, is becoming increasingly unstable.
And made accusations last night about the stroke.
She got physical.
Tom, I want her out of this house.
Will it be enough to keep the city from going under?
If not, the public wants to know what's next.
I would ask that you endure for a few more days.
How long... before they try and wrest it from you?
Sir, we're ready in your office.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Our phone lines are flooded with complaints about the closures.
Parents, teachers, conservancy groups, park and rec workers.
Temporary inconveniences which must be abided.
Sacrifices must be made, particularly in those wards which don't provide enough tax revenue.
Nonexistent in the 21st.
Then shutter its day care facilities, shelters, and community centers.
Sir, I understand your hostility towards Alderman Ross, but his ward's already stretched in terms of public services.
And he no longer has to provide them to residents of Lennox Gardens, because there are none.
At the moment.
I'll notify DFSS about shuttering those agencies right away.
Smaller measures like these can help, but, with all due respect, they're a drop in the bucket given the city's deficit.
What we really need is a federal bailout.
Which is why I want you in DC.
I need you to push for TARP funds.
Get the Treasury to buy our debt.
That's just what I was about to suggest.
Take the next plane out.
I'll make some calls, get you in front of the right people.
Yes, sir.
Ian, it was a bit chilly when last I visited the conference room.
Make our guests more comfortable.
It was sound advice and I took it.
To great success, as it turns out.
Congratulations on that McGantry arrest, by the way.
Timing could have been better.
We barely made it one news cycle before the budget crisis became a bigger headline.
True, but it's all of one piece... fall of the status quo, ascendency of new leadership.
What can I do for you, Mr. Zajac?
Double down.
Help me further separate myself from Tom Kane by providing your full power of your field operations.
Got to love a man with confidence.
If he gets wind of this...
In a few days, he's a nonissue.
City goes broke, it'll be up for grabs.
Pretty big takedown.
His biggest PAC contributor for years.
He must have done something huge to piss Kane off this much.
Like contribute to my campaign.
Might not have been Kane's play.
God knows the State's Attorney will do anything to get into the papers.
No, I'm pretty sure Doyle got this handed to him on a silver platter.
Kitty, you give your old boss way too much credit.
And anyway, McGantry is yesterday's news.
Today is all about the fact that Chicago's been run into the ground by the bad guys.
We're ready.
In here.
And you work for the good guys now.
Have a driver meet me at the gate.
I've got my RFP responses here, but I need my PowerPoint overnighted.
I'll call you from the cab.
Good a time as any to leave town.
I'm flying to DC, trying to mitigate some of the damage you've done.
It's not my fault the city can't meet its obligations on loan interests.
Kane's been working this Ponzi scheme for years.
By the time the receiver gets it straight, his term's over, and you're out of a job.
Should have stuck with Mr. Ross here.
FYI, if Borden takes over, your boss loses, too.
Unlike our mayor, I can rise again.
Seems like your name may not be worth so much after all.
No.
No.
No.
No!
No!
No!
You can't fucking do this!
Fuck you!
Fucking bitch!
Let me out!
Sweat it out, bastards.
The city has a pension payment tomorrow of over half a million dollars.
We could save that by shutting down select transit lines between 7:00 P.M. And 5:00 a.m.
It'll buy us some time, anyway.
Do it, but don't spare rush hour.
Not a cut the public will respond well to.
Perhaps you should make a statement.
Last thing I want to do is become the official face of this crisis when it is the council that is wholly to blame.
I just wish some informed insider would say the same to the press.
Sir?
You heard me.
After all these years,
I can't believe I've never seen your home.
We don't entertain here often.
Well, this is a special occasion, then.
John, my husband's trust isn't easily earned.
I've noticed.
My family's made more than one overture.
Yeah.
But at the moment,
Chicago is experiencing financial difficulties.
And you see an opportunity.
I do.
Does the mayor even know that I'm here?
He does.
But this was your idea?
-...
Yes.
Well, allow me to be the first Vacarro to contribute to Tom Kane's PAC.
John, now is not the time to think small.
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
This is Ian Todd.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
It's Emma.
You need to come here right away.
They've locked me in.
I have to see you.
I need you.
If you are satisfied with your message...
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!
Mr. Todd!
Mr. Todd!
Any comment on the deficit that stands to bankrupt the city?
Yes.
I do, actually.
Having worked with several council members,
I'm struck by the lack of responsibility being taken by its leadership in this crisis.
No less than a month ago, all 50 aldermen approved pay raises for themselves.
But when the mayor needed help in balancing the budget, they refused.
Now they're off the radar while public services are cut, citizens suffer, and an emergency manager with a six-figure salary is appointed.
Where's the democracy in that?
Excuse me.
No more cutbacks!
What qualifies someone, do you suppose, to run a city?
Mr. Kane, out of respect for your position,
I came here after hours so as not to cause any...
Did you study law?
Economics?
Get elected?
My team is here to ensure a smooth transition of power.
The fact is, no matter how much money you move around or how many light switches you turn off or jobs you eliminate, the city will default.
And because that is the reality of the situation,
I wanted to give you the opportunity to speak with your unions before I cut pensions and cancel contracts.
Do you really think
I'd allow the likes of you to take this from me?
A bean counter?
A shyster?
Someone who has more regard for the almighty dollar than the people of this city.
Short of a miracle, I'll be back in two days.
I'll see you then.
Hope to be your next governor.
Your campaign's been on quite a roller coaster.
With the positive press you've gotten since your mea culpa interview, think you still have a shot at winning the office?
Absolutely.
Because I still care about Illinois.
Which is why I didn't approve the mayor's request for a state-funded bailout.
Thank you.
Mr. Kane's played a big part in your candidacy.
- Has that changed?
- Well, he knows, as State Treasurer,
I have a fiscal responsibility to each and every taxpayer.
So in good conscience I can't saddle them with a debt incurred in a single city.
And how are the people of Chicago supposed to feel about that?
Well, they should be angry.
And I don't blame them.
They shouldn't have to feel the pain of mismanagement.
And people can think what they want about me personally, but my record will show I have tremendous fiscal discipline.
Hi, how are you?
Thank you so much.
Good to meet you.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.
Good.
- Thank you so much for your support.
- Nice to see you again.
Yes, great to see you.
Thank you for your support.
Thank you so much for your support.
Let's wrap this up, okay?
Thanks, folks.
See you at the polls.
City's closing this line down anyway.
What you're suggesting is unprecedented.
Worked for the auto industry.
That was corporate.
You are talking about using TARP funds to buy up municipal debt.
The mayor's hoping the Treasury will be pragmatic.
We go down, it's not just Chicago that feels the pain.
Not pragmatic to open the door, allowing every distressed city to claim our limited funds.
Illinois' 20 electoral votes.
It is unclear that a weakened Kane can deliver that.
Can we get the mayor on the phone with the secretary to discuss our proposal?
Why don't you just fucking roll over and die?
Sorry, I told him...
Nice to see you, too, William.
You want this city to suffer, at least have the decency to spread it around, not just gut my ward, which as you know, don't have much to begin with.
- Why?
- Why what?
This?
Don't you care about your constituents?
The people you were elected to serve?
Do you want to see them at the mercy of an outsider?
As opposed to you?
You are not that petty or stupid.
Your time has come.
Our time.
Years of bloody battle between us, now we both lose to a third party.
You're the one who pushed it over the edge.
With that.
That, Alderman... can save us both.
Hey, Roxie.
A little bit of this for a little bit of that?
It's Meredith Kane.
How are you?
I'm just fine.
Thanks for asking.
Funny you should call.
The wife asked about you just last night.
Give my best to Edie.
Mac, I know you're busy, but if at all possible,
I'd love to meet you for lunch.
- You here in Springfield?
- No, in Chicago.
But I could have you flown in on a friend's private jet.
We could chat.
Last time we did resulted in a steep National Guard bill.
No, this won't cost a thing.
I'll have you back in Springfield in a couple of hours.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
Never pass on a free lunch.
Wonderful.
I'll see you soon.
You really do smooth out my rough edges, don't you?
Hello?
You weren't lying when you said someplace out of the way.
Well, I can't be too careful with the goods that I got.
I like the sound of that.
Your suspicions about Ezra Stone are not unfounded.
Meaning it was an inside job.
Gotta be some terms here if you want the full story.
You know, last time I saw you, you were barside with Kane's pal from the O'Hare ceremony.
Kind of seemed like you guys were part of the same fan club.
Past tense.
Look, CPD's been doing Kane's dirty work for years.
Then he turns around and scrapes Royczyk like shit from his shoe.
Now he's eyeballing our pension funds to keep the city from going belly up.
You'll go on record?
For 10,000 bucks.
We don't pay for stories.
Well, you don't get 'em this good, either.
What, toxic waste in Bensenville?
Please.
The "Sentinel" is a paper of record, detective Dinovo, not a tabloid.
Yeah, and I'm a man without retirement pay who needs to leave town if I go public.
I'd say 10 grand was a bargain.
Take it or leave it.
There's more to tell.
...that's not what she said to me...
Hey, I don't blame you.
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Mr. Taylor.
Come here, man.
It's good to see you, man.
- It's good to be seen.
- Yeah.
How you doing?
Fine now that charges against me got dropped.
I'm grateful for everything you did in that regard.
You kept your head when you were in custody.
That kind of loyalty is something I very much value.
Of course it is.
So the Gardens are done for a while, but I'd imagine you still need some help in the field.
I understand young brother covered for me while I was gone, but...
Trey, go down the hall, get us some ice.
I want to fix the ward boss a drink, catch him up on things.
All right.
How your family, man?
Everybody good?
Everybody's good.
You had sex with Treasurer Zajac?
Oral.
In his office.
That part was okay with me.
But then he eliminated my internship, which was way not okay.
And when I saw him on the street, he pretended he didn't know me.
Wow.
He's just a hypocrite, telling people he's only had one affair.
It's a lie.
Patty, I get why you want to hold him accountable.
I do.
It's a completely healthy reaction.
But if you go public with this, you will be savaged.
You will be painted as a slut.
He will deny it, say you're delusional, and everyone will believe him.
Don't throw your future away on this.
He's not worth it.
I really thought you'd be on my side.
I need a breakdown ward by ward.
Get me the southeast first.
I am.
Just sleep on this, okay?
Give it some thought.
Call me tomorrow and we'll talk about it.
Okay.
So what was that all about?
She used to work for Zajac.
She's looking for a new job, but we don't have any space for her.
Getting too old for this shit.
Description, location, compensation.
Tonight.
I'm meeting with Senator Carter later.
If we can get assurances that banking won't go after them, maybe we can get the Fed to help.
Good, keep at it.
How are things going there?
A day from shutting down schools.
I'll keep you posted.
You may be my only hope.
Mac's quite affable, though he and my husband have had their moments.
Which is why you're here and not the mayor himself.
As you can imagine, he's quite busy.
And I do play a role.
It's quite clear how much political power you have, Meredith.
Mac.
A fella could get used to this.
Mac, this is John Vacarro.
John, Mac Cullen.
So, what's for lunch?
Let's go.
I'm not much of a gambler myself, but the track has proven to be a solid investment.
People seem to enjoy it.
Bought it several years ago.
Put in a global pari-mutuel betting system.
Been a moneymaker ever since.
Very nice.
As is the box.
Nothing quite like it in Springfield.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Kane.
Meredith, are you all right?
Yeah, I just needed to sit for a second.
Shall we cut to the chase before the horses do?
Absolutely.
McGantry's property surrounding Lennox Gardens.
- Now owned by the state.
- Go on.
I buy it at market value plus 5%.
Do you?
Shouldn't that be phrased as a question, Mr. Vacarro?
We both know market value these days is a turd with a price tag.
Three years ago, McGantry bought that same real estate for a hell of a lot more than that.
That was then, Mac.
And this is now, I suppose.
We take the guarantee to the banks as collateral for emergency loans.
You come out looking like the savior of Chicago.
Jesus.
Someone get me a pair of tights and a cape.
- Is that my new identity since the riots?
- Why not?
Think I'll get a chance to place a bet before I have to go?
Meme.
Hey, hey.
Hard man to find, cuz?
Just been working in different places, man.
Sound about right.
You wouldn't be thinking of running off on me now, would you?
I will find you.
I ain't going nowhere, bro.
I'm just building my business back up.
I got a little now if you want it.
The fuck is that?
5K is some serious paper, man.
And I ain't got 10 years to wait on you.
Have all my money today or we got issues.
You know I ain't got that shit, man.
Hey, look, tell me something, man.
Really.
That little white girl worth all this?
Man, I'm done with that bitch.
Look at the man.
He done with her... and yet the debt remains.
So tell me, what we gonna do about that?
What's up with the Zajac volunteer?
She was inexperienced.
We don't need her.
You're lying.
Why?
I'm not.
If another one's come out of the woodwork, why aren't we running with it?
Catherine, it's gilding the lily.
Not when he's trending up.
Proof that it was more than one affair could finish him.
If you've got something on Zajac, I want it.
So either he banged the fat chick or she's mad he didn't bang her.
Which is it?
She's just a kid, okay?
If we go public...
This is my fourth run.
I don't give a shit about collateral damage.
But the meeting was set.
- He can't see you.
I'm sorry.
- Can't or won't?
Carter's been waiting 15 years to get the gavel on banking.
He's not gonna give it up for this.
He owes his career to Kane.
You think he can get by without Cook County next primary?
Look, everyone's watching Walsh/Zajac and thinking maybe Kane's finally irrelevant.
She wins, his pull evaporates.
People forget a fundamental truth.
Tom Kane always finds a way.
The further you back him into a corner, the more painful the cuts when he fights his way out.
I'm sorry.
After all this, I'm getting no?
Welcome to politics.
You might wish you'd stayed out.
Thanks, you two, but I need to get going.
Need to check in with Borden before it gets too late.
Sorry you couldn't stay longer, Governor.
With only a few months left in office,
I'm sure Mac wants to make the most of them.
Tell Tom I wish him the best with this thing.
I really do.
Will do.
Which way to the jet?
Tell me.
He's not on board.
They say a mule will labor 10 years willingly and patiently for the privilege of kicking you just once.
He wants more than that.
Yeah.
Speak later.
Payroll for sanitation won't be met without more cuts.
At this point, we're at mandated furloughs for nonessential city workers.
- Any word from Mona?
- Nothing encouraging.
Sir, is it possible that... will we lose control of the city?
I want this delivered by hand... to Governor Cullen.
I believe Governor Cullen is out of the office until tomorrow.
Then deliver it as soon as possible,
God damn it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Mayor, just thought you should know, the emergency manager is meeting with her advance team in the conference room.
10% across-the-board layoffs aren't enough.
We'll need at least 18.
It has not been two days.
You are interlopers here because of my hospitality.
I want you to leave now.
First off, this advance team is here by order of the state.
- And in 24 hours...
- Get out!
You!
You're postponing the inevitable.
She's wrong.
- Are you out of your mind?
- I wanted to see you.
Here, in the middle of nowhere, after not calling me for days?
Yeah, I know I've been out of touch.
No word, no explanation.
Nothing.
Kane has a brain disease.
I was tracking that before Rosebud came along.
Reason I was over the border when you called?
That's where he was during the riots... an experimental treatment center just outside of Toronto.
My gut says that Stone knew about the illness as well, saw that Kane was unfit for office, so he leaks the Bensenville story under the name Rosebud.
Kane ultimately finds out about it and kills him for it.
The burglary gone bad, which every other paper in town seems so ready to print...
I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it.
Now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him.
- We've got Kane by the balls.
- We?
Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone.
I did not.
I told you it may be Stone.
May be.
And I told you, Sam.
No one else.
So don't even fucking think about using my name, okay?
Look, he can't touch you from a prison cell.
That's exactly where he's going.
You think Kane is blinded by ambition?
You may want to take a look in the mirror.
Jesus.
Fucking me isn't enough?
Now you're gonna analyze me?
Excuse me?
Wow.
Look, I didn't mean that.
Don't use my name.
I'm gonna use your name anyway.
You'll be subpoenaed.
Do it.
I'll deny everything.
And by the way...
fuck you!
You know, you just...
you can't trust her.
I think we can.
Defending that kid today was a big move for her as a person.
Since when do you give a damn about Kitty as a person?
Take it easy.
Good news is, we want another Zajac scandal, we got it.
Yeah, no thanks to her.
- I need a cigarette.
- No, you don't.
Sit down.
Sit down.
She knows people, so what?
She does.
You know me.
I'll be back in a minute.
Senator Walsh?
Just wanted to say congratulations on your campaign.
Voted for you every election.
Well, thank you so much.
Let's see if we can make it to the governor's office this time,
- Yeah.
- Thanks again.
Are you planning on leaving soon?
- No.
- Would you mind if I...
Go home.
Would you like me to arrange for your car to...
It's a sailor's term for being overtaken by misfortune.
"Hard up in a clinch and no knife to cut the seizing."
I'm not going anywhere.
You're dismissed.
Yes, sir.
Where's Trey?
I don't know, man.
But he asked me to talk to you...
To what?
Waste my fucking time?
A few weeks in a suit and he's a player now?
Tell him...
Hold up, nigga.
I'm here to tell you something, man.
- That right?
- He wants you gone, right?
So we got one way you can do it, or we got another.
Are you serious?
You think you can just get up in my car and threaten me?
I'm trying to do you a favor here, bro.
And I'm gonna do you one by not punching you in your goddamn face.
Get the fuck out.
If you don't do this, he'll kill us both, man.
- I promise you that.
- I ain't scared of that motherfucker.
- And sure as hell ain't scared of you.
- Keep talking.
Give me a goddamn break.
Think I don't know who you are?
Darius, the one who's been banging Kane's daughter.
- Shut the fuck up!
- What's this, some kind of joke, man?
Trey trying to punk me out with this shit?
Send me some weak-ass, punk-ass, bitch-made puss...
Okay, we got to get ready.
They're picking us up in 30 minutes.
Okay?
Come on, lazy girl.
Come on, Tina.
Come on, you...
Tina?
Tina!
Tina!
I need medical help!
Now!
Tina.
Sweetheart.
Tina.
Tina.
Tina.
Tina.
Can we say "dead lesbian"?
EMT hinted it was a drug overdose, maybe ketamine.
What about Walsh?
Anybody know if she was under the influence?
Or should we just write, "Woman found naked in her bed"?
Where the hell is Miller?
He's not answering his phone.
Track down that EMT.
You, don't say lesbian.
Or ketamine.
"Dead woman found in hotel room with Walsh, possible overdose."
I'm going to the hotel.
Breaking news...
Senator Walsh's top aide was found dead early this morning in the senator's hotel room.
We're going now live to the scene.
- Was it an overdose?
- What was your relationship?
Were you doing drugs with her?
Why are you afraid to come out of the closet?
Is your campaign now over?
- Are you a lesbian?
- How long have you known the deceased?
Senator Walsh... senator can you tell us, are you dropping out of the race?
Was she just your lover?
Is it true you were in bed together?
Ma'am, how long have you been lovers?
Senator Walsh, did you love her?
Is your campaign over?
What's the best look for taking over a city?
Stripes read serious.
I don't know why everyone's so surprised.
Worst-kept secret in Springfield,
Walsh being a muff diver.
This just came for you from Mayor Kane's office.
Last pitch for clemency?
Humph.
What is it?
Get the mayor on the line.
Why didn't you answer?
Why didn't you call?
- This is dangerous, what we're doing.
- They won't know.
This isn't about your parents.
It's about you.
- Are you okay?
- I confronted her about everything.
We have to get you out of here.
What, do you think I want to stay?
Tell me.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Well, what if your father negotiated a deal with the State's Attorney?
You'd have to plead guilty.
Emma, listen to me.
You'd have to play the part.
I'm not one of their employees.
I don't have to eat their shit.
You're right.
So forget about what you have to do.
What do you want?
I want them to pay for everything.
So put on a dress, paste on a smile, and take the long...
The long view?
He'll be dead soon.
What?
Lewy Body Dementia.
Maybe that's justice enough.
You... you won't tell anyone?
You can't.
Of course not.
More layoffs are planned as the city's economic picture worsens.
Governor Cullen is said to be en route to City Hall where he's expected to make an announcement.
Elizabeth Borden, the emergency manager appointed by the governor, could not be reached for comment , but observers expect her to join the governor for that briefing.
Anything at all?
Sir, I wasn't able to...
I'm sorry.
I'm on my way in from the airport.
Don't bother coming in.
I want to.
Suit yourself.
No, everything's about to change.
In fact, hell's about to freeze over.
I've got to go.
We heard from Kenya?
Hasn't come by, hasn't called.
This motherfucker gonna miss out on all the fireworks.
What brought you out here today?
They closed the day care.
I work all day.
Where am I supposed to put my children?
The city's on edge as the deadline approaches for Mayor Kane...
They got here this morning before I did.
What do you think he's doing about all this?
No idea.
All I know is how he spent the night.
He come out at all?
Make or take any calls?
One from the governor, that's it.
Yes?
Cullen's on his way up.
We'll need the briefing room.
Please do what you can to make it look presentable.
Thank you.
This is it.
You gonna let him know this is going down?
Get the press room ready.
Sir?
Excuse me for interrupting.
I wish City Hall was a taller building.
Or closer to the water.
Be nice to see the lake.
The governor's arrived.
Presumably to hand control to Miss Borden.
Some believe you think more clearly near water.
Have you heard that?
Mr. Mayor, I cannot express to you strongly enough the urgency of the situation.
I don't want to see you surrender.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Good man.
Another day.
Ready?
Emma, please.
I don't feel well.
I know.
Brought you some tea.
I'm sorry.
You were right.
I have been using again.
Made me a little crazy, I guess.
But keeping me in my room kind of forced me to get sober.
And I'm glad.
And I'm gonna be good now, Mom, I promise.
Good.
I heard on the radio there's a press conference.
What's going on?
I don't know exactly.
Kane's in with Cullen.
Do you have anything?
Should I stop them?
No, we're radioactive.
Ross is here.
Fucking vulture.
I'm almost there.
Hurry, they're about to start.
- I haven't seen Borden go in yet.
You?
- No.
What's he doing here?
We've suffered together.
Tightened our belts.
Made sacrifices.
We can tolerate no more.
And we don't have to.
Along with my colleague in the council Alderman William Ross and entrepreneur John Vacarro, we have put together a coalition of leaders from both business and government to build a dazzling complex on the grounds formerly known as Lennox Gardens.
A project to revitalize the city and bring in tremendous revenues, licensing fees, jobs, and tourism.
I present to you The Gardens Convention Center and Casino.
Projected income...
$2.6 billion in the first five years, 1.1 billion in taxes.
A crucial percentage going towards schools, libraries, parks, streets, transportation.
Because of our coalition, we are in receipt of this letter of credit allowing the city to borrow against the promise of this epic venture.
And who better to oversee such an undertaking than outgoing governor Mac Cullen, who will serve as chairman for the Chicago Gaming Authority at the end of his tenure.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back in business.
Now there are many, of course, behind the scenes who helped bring this project to fruition.
But I would like to thank one in particular.
One who has been a tireless advocate and a driving force in the redevelopment of Lennox Gardens.
Mona Fredricks.
Got a hit on this aged-up Boetker photo.
This was less than a mile from the site of the shooting.
Only partial plates.
I assume you're running them now.
So I would ask that you come back to me with the full story, Detective.
Seems the budget crisis is over.
Public response to the mayor's casino plan has been largely positive.
With the promise of this large a cash infusion over the course of the next several years, several banks have agreed to provide low-interest loans and the emergency manager has been sent packing.
A goddamn casino.
With everything that implies.
Well, now we know why he wanted us to prosecute Babe McGantry.
Kane just sold the land we seized.
I took the fucking bait for this lawyered-up piece of shit.
Fucking fuck!
Yes?
What is it?
I just... very well played, sir.
And I can't begin to tell you what an honor it is to be in your service.
Well, considering the way things went today, that could be the case for a long time to come.
I certainly hope so.
And suddenly he's the messiah.
He's untouchable now, Sam.
You know that, don't you?
You all right?
I don't know what I am any more.
I'm assuming that they weren't into recreational drugs...
Walsh and...
Tina.
I heard it was probably ketamine.
Is it possible?
Could he be that evil?
Could he have done this?
Can't imagine it was anyone else.
Catherine wasn't going to work for him.
Ever.
See, that's what I don't get.
I was still in this race.
I could have won it on my own.
Not what he wanted.
And you weren't gonna win, Ben.
We all but bought Cook County.
What'll she do?
Walsh.
Open a homicide investigation.
Not much else she can do.
You're gonna be the next governor.
He owns you.
There you are.
So, what do you want to do?
You know what I want.
Not this.
What do you want to do now?
Those TARP funds you had me chasing, we were never gonna get them, were we?
You just wanted me out of the way so you could do this.
You have a daughter, yes?
Mine's 10.
It always mattered very much to me that she was proud... of me.
What I do.
And yet, I'm still here.
So I must be lying to someone.
And what about you?
Who are you lying to?
There was no political upside to the promises you made.
So either you give a shit and you pussied out, or you're a motherfucking lunatic!
Which is it, Tom?
Your naiveté was charming for a time,
Ms. Fredricks.
Even enchanting.
I wondered what it would feel like to bask in the admiration of someone so pure of intent.
It was nice.
But now I know.
Don't bother to collect your things.
I'll have someone send them along.
And give my best to Bitsy.
I'm sure she's very proud of you.
Miss.
- Yes?
- If you wouldn't mind.
What is this about?
Get in!
Now!
BELLS TOLL
Argentalium shackles!
Oh...bats.
HE WINCES
Oh, this room stinks of breather.
I'm sure you'll make it your own.
Is this my bloodbinding gift?
I took great pain to get exactly the one you asked for.
- Oh, thank you, Father.
- No, not till after the bloodbinding.
It will taste all the sweeter once Vlad is dead.
HE SNIFFS
Mmm.
Aagh!
You took your time!
- Your dad lost the key.
- Well, don't stress.
I'm about to be bloodbound to someone I don't love, forever.
Being roasted alive may be the highlight of my day.
It's only natural to get cold feet.
You haven't told me how I'm supposed to kill Vlad.
I was trying to protect you.
If we're found out, we could be executed for this.
Executed for what?
The Rings of Arianrhod.
Forbidden dark weapons.
Generations shudder at their very name.
They must be activated by a tear from the victim's bloodline.
How am I supposed to get that tear?
No, that's my job.
You focus on getting Vlad's first bite, which will give you great power and then, you will place this on your finger.
This is the Ring of the Mother and you will give Vlad the Ring of the Son.
Now, once he wears this, Vlad will be forced to obey your every command.
I'll order him to his death.
You might want to have a little fun with him first.
LAUGHTER, CHEERING
Vladdy!
Vladdy, Vladdy.
I was just about to come and get you.
Sorry, mate.
They said it was traditional, but...
It was a classic bloodbinding prank.
And by classic, you mean I could have died.
Exactly.
Vamp up, Vlad.
You wouldn't catch me whingeing about a bit of charring.
- No, I can see you're made of stronger stuff.
- You'd better believe it.
- I see the bloodbinding rituals have begun.
- And ended.
Unless you want to go to the ceremony without a blood groom.
Aren't you even going to get me a wedding peasant?
A wedding...peasant?
Yes, ancient vampire tradition.
As soon as the blood rite has been completed, the blood wife and blood groom sink their fangs into a peasant - together.
- That's disgusting.
- It's a great honour for the peasant.
- Everyone's a winner.
- Ooh, Master.
Bitey, bitey, bitey!
As long as I don't have to bite you, thank you very much.
- There will be no biting tonight.
- No biting?
!
On our bloodbinding day?
The leaders of the Slayer's Guild will be here.
To prove to them we're serious about peace, we're going to share a goblet of low-sodium soya blood.
Think of the Dracula reputation!
And the Ramanga clan tradition.
I don't want to hear one more word about biting or vampiric tradition.
I'm this close to calling the whole thing off!
He can't do that.
Can he?
- There'll be a blood bath.
- Oh, sounds fun.
- Of Dracula blood.
I'll talk to Vlad.
Ingrid....
I've thought about your third task.
Come.
Look, everyone gets first-bite nerves.
- But you are doing the right thing.
- Am I?
- Pff!
You can't call it off now, there'd be a dust bath.
- I know.
Oh, look, what's wrong?
You can tell me.
Is it the breather girl?
Her name is Erin.
Erin, Erin, Erin.
She left me a note, warned me not to try and follow her.
I'm sorry to hear that, Vlad.
- Really?
- I know how it feels to love a breather.
So wrong and yet so...
Oh, so...
- Dad?
- Hmm?
- Are you trying to tell me something?
- What?
No, no, no, no, Vlad, it's all for the best.
Look, you'll get over Eric...
Erin!
In a couple of centuries.
You've got some strange ideas about equality, but deep down you're old-school bad.
We need more vamps like you on the High Council.
- And fewer like my brother.
Am I right?
- Mm.
So, we come to your final task.
Bring me one single tear from a member of your bloodline.
- You're plotting against Vlad, aren't you?
- What makes you say that?
Experience.
Optimism.
Don't worry.
This task's in the bag.
- KNOCK AT DOOR
- What?
Happy bloodbinding day, bro.
I haven't got time for your games.
Don't you want your present?
What is it this time?
Garlic-flavoured chocolates?
- Ooh, another sun lamp!
- No.
I thought it might help you.
To remember the old days.
It must be so hard, knowing that you'll never see her again, living without her for thousands and thousands of years.
- Thanks, Ingrid.
- You're very welcome.
Thanks for reminding me what's really important.
SHE SIGHS
- Vlad, where are you going?
You can't leave now.
- Oh, get out of the way.
- Listen to me, for Erin's sake.
- I am not getting blood-bound to Adze!
Then thousands will die.
If you insult the Ramangas again, then they'll take their revenge in blood, and the slaves will retaliate
- and everything you've worked for will be lost.
- Yeah, why do you care?
You never wanted peace anyway.
After all we've been through, you still don't trust me.
The only person I trust is Erin, so I'm going to find her, wherever she is.
You don't know where she is?
She is a trained slayer.
She's blocking your telepathic powers.
Don't you get it?
She doesn't want to be found!
We should put our plans into action.
Why the delay?
It would not be seemly.
- We are, after all, guests of the Dracula.
- You are joking, right?
I never joke when it comes to vampiric tradition.
- Once Vlad's dead, what then?
- Uh...
Bertram, what's the meaning of this unexpected visit?
I...have a message from Vlad.
Which is...?
Vlad wishes to apologise for his discourteous behaviour this morning.
He begs for your forgiveness
- and hopes that there'll be no more unpleasantness today.
- Ohh!
- I accept his apology.
- I thank you on Vlad's behalf.
But why are you being so formal?
This is a moment of joy.
- We should be having fun.
- Sounds good to me.
- Not you.
You're a girl.
But us stags, we should be celebrating.
Downstairs in ten.
Bring Vlad.
HE WHISTLES A CHEERY TUNE
Ohhh!
There's something on the pillow!
It can't be...
What's wrong now, Renfield?
Nothing, Master.
Whathaveyougot there?
Show me!
- What are you doing?
- Ssh!
Winning my place on the High Council.
You toadying lickspittle!
Where did that come from?
In a coffin.
No.
No, no, no.
(Show time.)
Itcan'tbe !
Tell me the truth.
Am I...am I losing my...?
Happens to all of us, when we get to a certain age, like 640.
608!
And he's losing his memory, too.
- Master, shall I just give them a decent burial?
- No!
No, no, no.
No, no.
No.
Just let me hold them one last time.
- Goodbye, my old friends.
- HE SOBS
Wait a minute.
These aren't my illustrious locks!
- This is filthy girl-hair!
- Really?
I can't imagine how that got there(!
)
Fancy something?
As long as you promise not to spike it with hair-remover.
- I reserve inflicting pain for family members only.
- Lucky them.
So, loner boy, why are you hanging around our house of dysfunction?
What, apart from this?
The glamorous company, of course.
- No.
Really.
- Shouldn't I be asking you that?
- You obviously despise your family.
- We're vampires.
It goes with the territory.
I can hardly believe yours is any different.
Devious, despotic, deceitful.
Yeah, the usual.
So, how come you were living at Fang City with a bunch of filthy ferals?
Everyone should spread their wings, don't you think?
Not if you end up in Stench Central.
- I forgot - you prefer hiding under Daddy's wings.
- Bat off.
- Just saying it like I see it.
- But why are you hanging around Vlad?
Because.
Nobody loves you, and you've no better place to be.
Actually, I do.
Wolfie, heel!
HE WHIMPERS
Did I do something wrong?
Everything about you is wrong.
If I had my way, we'd dump you back with your feral little father.
- You're mean.
- Of course I am.
I'm a vampire.
A full vampire.
Not a mongrel mutt.
Look at you.
- HE YAPS
- Perfect.
Come on, Wolfie!
I just need one little tear.
- HE SNARLS
- It's not funny!
It's ridiculous.
Why are you doing this?
I have to complete all my tasks in order to impress the High Council.
A bunch of stuffy old men.
Why do you care what they think?
Oh, wait.
I learnt this one in therapy.
Deep down, I'm just a lonely little girl
- who craves her daddy's approval.
- No, you're not.
You're a ruthless psychopath who craves fresh blood and raw power.
You've been following me all day.
What does that make you?
- I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself.
- Why do you even care?
I just do!
Care.
OK?
- But I'm a power-mad psychopath.
- Maybe I like power-mad psychopaths.
- I don't need anyone.
- Exactly.
Hmmm.
Ah!
Will Vlad's mother be attending?
Sadly not.
She's...indisposed.
What could keep a mother from attending a social occasion like this?
Put it this way, believe me, she'd only want to steal limelight.
Anyway, she has a health complaint.
She she's unable to travel at present.
I heard about the recent dalliance.
Fleas, is it?
HE CHUCKLES
Yes.
She's still in quarantine.
I didn't want to mar the celebrations...
- with an infestation.
- Such an obliging host, as always.
- Ah.
- And Adze's mother - will she be joining us?
- She's already here.
How are you enjoying festivities, my darling?
Hmm?
She's having the time of her un-life.
Hmm.
When will Vlad be joining us?
- Soon.
- I hope so.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Another drink?
And I really don't like being lied to.
Huh.
I can recommend the Duchess of Warsaw - young, fruity, excellent nose.
Excellent face altogether, as I remember.
- What's going on?
Where's Vlad?
- He went to find Erin.
- Oh, you're joking!
- We need to bring him back.
- Don't you think I know that?
- One tear from my bloodline.
- Good girl, Ingrid.
Good girl?
- I mean bad girl, of course.
- Whatever.
- Just get me on to the High Council.
- Oh, yes - on one condition.
No more conditions.
I've done all your stupid tasks.
- What more do you need?
- Just one thing.
- You.
- Me?
- Her?
Your daughter is bad to the bone and I like that.
I will recommend her to the High Council if she consents to become my blood wife.
- Is he talking about me?
- Shut up, Ingrid - this is men's business.
Are you talking about her?
I know it's an unexpected honour.
It's unexpected all right.
I was warned that no vamp in their right mind would touch Ingrid Dracula with a ten-foot stake.
But those that warned me were fools.
- They just didn't know how to handle you.
- And you do?
Ingrid Dracula is bitter and frustrated, but Ingrid Ramanga will be powerful and magnificent.
- Ingrid Ramanga?
- Forget about your father and brother - they've never been worthy of you.
Join me instead.
Hmm.
Go.
No.
Ha...no?
- No?
!
- My name is Ingrid Dracula.
I should have been your heir and I'm going to prove it.
I shall make the name of Dracula feared and hated throughout the world and I can't do that if I'm stuck with an old coffin-lodger like you.
- CHOKES WITH RAGE
- Urgh!
How dare she!
Well, I did warn you about the ten-foot stake.
Ingrid.
I was right!
- You don't need anyone else.
- Thanks for reminding me.
No.
- But...
You said you...
- What?
Cared.
I do, just... ..not like that.
- I gave up a seat at the High Council for you.
- I'm sorry.
- I...
I thought we were friends.
- We WERE friends.
That's why you're still alive.
'Marry Adze and unite the vampires.
'You have one shot at this.
This is what you've always dreamed of.
'Go back and finish it.'
- Vlad, I need to tell you...
- I owe you an apology.
You were right.
No, YOU were right.
The Ramangas are plotting against you.
- You can't go through with the blood binding.
- People will die if I don't.
- You'll die if you do.
- Have you got any solid proof?
- No, but...
I've made up my mind.
Your children disrespected me.
Yes, but only Ingrid and she doesn't really count.
And what about Vlad, huh?
Where's he?
He's...
Bertrand, where...
- Vladdy, there you are!
There he is.
- Where have you been?
- Thinking.
- About what?
- My responsibilities.
I am fully committed to this blood binding.
- All I ask is that you support my peace plan.
- ..
Hmm?
Of course.
Ha!
This is a UV torch and I'm not afraid to use it.
- My father said he put you in a trance.
- I faked it.
- He's no match for a trained slayer.
- Senile old fool.
- Why me?
Why mess with slayers when you could have bitten anyone?
Because nothing gets a party started like draining the blood-groom's old love.
Get back or your daughter eats sunlight.
Then you will eat fire.
- I guess this is a stand-off.
- Not really.
I thought I told you not to unwrap your peasant early.
- Did you really need that much garlic aftershave?
- Sorry, mate.
There will be half the High Council there.
I can't take any chances.
- So.
Are you OK?
- Hmph!
No, um...
You're doing a...
You're doing a good thing.
We've all made sacrifices, mate.
The bloodshed ends now.
BELL TOLLS
- Ingrid...
- Go stake yourself.
- What I said.
- I'm sorry if you misunderstood.
- You will be.
ELECTRICITY CRACKLES
Hey.
Vlad.
Oops.
Sorry, mate.
- Right on cue.
Come to gloat?
- No.
You threw away your true love to marry for power.
Not power - peace.
Whatever.
You're doing the right thing.
Love is for breathers and idiots.
Don't you ever forget that.
All right.
Let's do this.
- RAMANGA:
- The Rings of Arianrhod...
- ADZE:
I'll order him to his death.
You might want to have a little... fun with him first.
It'll taste all the sweeter once Vlad is dead.
SHE STRAINS
FANFARE
My fellow vampires.
We are gathered together to join this vampire and this...other vampire.
- Bertrand!
- Erin?
What're you...?
I'm the wedding breakfast, as if you didn't know.
I didn't.
I came in here looking for evidence against the Ramangas.
- So you're not in on it?
- In on what?
The plan to kill Vlad with the Rings of Arianrhod?
- The Rings of Arianrhod?
- Yes, the plot that's going on right now unless you go and save him.
Go, go!
Hold on...
Just one...
Oh, right.
Require and charge you both...
Just cause or impediment, blah-de-blah-de...
Oh, whatever.
Just get to the biting.
- I surrender myself to the first bite of the chosen one.
- Mm.
Stop the ceremony!
I have a just cause or impediment.
- No, no, no
- I skipped that bit.
- Well, go back!
Adze and her father are planning to kill Vlad.
ATTENDEES GASPS
Ramanga honour will brook no more insult.
- You'd better be so-o-o right about this.
- I am.
The blood binding rings are the Rings of Arianrhod.
Forbidden dark weapons?
Nice one.
Don't be so ridiculous.
These are perfectly normal blood-binding rings.
Then you won't mind if Redfield runs a few forensic tests...?
Hand over the rings, Adze.
Leave her alone.
Nobody threatens my Vladdy.
Ah!
Go Dad!
- How did you know about the rings?
- Erin told me.
- The Ramangas kidnapped her - she's a prisoner.
- Erin...
He's dead.
Get back if you value Erin's life.
I control her every move.
Don't I, Erin?
Walk.
Stop.
If you try anything stupid I will get her to jump.
All right, what do you want?
You know what I want.
The first bite of the chosen one.
Vlad.
Vlad...
She really shouldn't be able to do that.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt Erin.
You must...not...
Erin!

I mean, Porn Tube.
Porn Hub.
Red Tube.

I'm lonely.
I'm sorry you're sad.
Well, I've got a competition to win for my son because I love him more than I love Justin Bieber.
I do love Junior.
He's no Justin Bieber, but...
We don't care, Cleveland.
We've got our own lives going on.
I can't pay my gas bill.
Tell your stories on your show.
Hey, yo!
What's up, Stoolbend?

It's your boy, DJ Charlie Chode Rock from your favorite station, 106.1 The Squirt!
And today, I'm up in the place to be with these fly guys and gals, ready to decide who's the ultimate Justin Bieber fan.
And here to kick things off, it's Justin Bieber himself live!

What's up, tweens?

It's me, The Biebs, biebing at you live from your junior high school.
Go, football team!
Are you people ready for some dancing?

Yeah!
I gotta hop.
See you at the big dance!

It's pretty clear who deserves these Justin Bieber tickets.
The winner of the Squirt 106.1 dance-off is
Cleveland Brown!
Who-- based on that dancing--
I have got to officially declare the whitest black man in America!
What?
!
But Wayne Brady's the whitest black man in America.
Not anymore, brother.
MAN On your right is the home of the whitest black man in America.
Damn it!
And on your left, Kendra from Hoarders.
I can't find my cat!
"Whitest Black Man in America," my foot.
"Whitest Black Man in America," my other foot.
Donna, you don't think
I'm the Whitest Black Man in America, do you?
No, honey.
What does that even mean?
May I take this?
It means you were dancing like a little white girl, so you could see a little white boy dance and sing for little white boys, white girls and a rainbow of pedophiles.
I was trying to win those tickets for Junior.
Keep me out of your freak show.
I really do want to go.
Look at you.
You still say things like,
"Party over here!" and "Too legit to quit!"
Yeah, boy-ee!
Gross!
You're a joke.
Stop teasing Cleveland...
who does always make sure to introduce his "one black friend from college"
to his "one black friend from work."
Reggie and Reggie became good friends.
And you are the only black person
I've ever seen eat trail mix.
It's barbecue-flavored trail mix.
I feel you, dawg.
Some people have called me the blackest white man in America.
No one calls you that.
Yeah, I don't think most people know you exist.
Cleveland, do you even know the difference between an African man and an African-American man?
Of course!
I know Tracy Morgan is an African because of his pot belly, droopy National Geographic boobies and flies.
Cleveland, that's a ridiculous stereotype!
And nobody is as filthy as Tracy Morgan.
Yeah, and you're always making jokes about Jewish people.
Black folks got enough to deal with.
We ain't got no time to differentiate between types of honkies.
Rallo!
Are you trying to get us killed?
!
That word is every bit as offensive to whites as the you-know-what word is to blacks.
No, it's not.
It's not even close.
But that kind of clueless hypersensitivity to racial matters is classic honky behavior.
Look, Cleveland, we were just joking around.
What difference does it make?
It makes a big difference to me!
I need to figure this out...
A-sap
What?
As soon as possible!
No longer will I be judged by the content of my character, but by the color of my skin!
For today, Cleveland Brown becomes a black man!
Oh, Lord.
Junior, you been eating my trail mix?
!
Nope, that was me.
My apologies, Cleve Lemon.
I thought I was eating garbage.

Yo, Donna!
I don't appreciate you sendin' your punk-ass, busta-ass,
Jheri curl wearing'-ass friends down here to shoot at me and my homies!
Cleveland, why are you quoting box office masterpiece Friday?
'Cause I'm a black man now, and that's what black people do.
Now, Donna, how come you ain't got no pictures of no brothas up on the wall?
Cleveland, that is your brother Broderick.
Blowin' by it!
Now, it's the hottest day of the year, there's racial tension everywhere, and we ain't patronizing your pizzeria till there's some brothas up on that wall!
Isn't that right, supporting actress Rosie Perez?
Yeah!
Do The Right Thing!
Aaaah!
Oh, my balled-up papers and toenails.
Oh, Cleveland, being black isn't about this stereotypical nonsense.
It's about being comfortable in your own skin.
You need help.
Well, since black people don't believe in therapy, I'm gonna go think on this while I wash my car in a public park.
Is that even a black stereotype?
!
I've seen 'em do it.
Oh, maybe I'll find what I'm looking for at church.
What was T-Pain doing here?
Thank you for meeting with me, Reverend.
I need guidance.
I don't know who I am.
Cleveland, I can tell your heart is heavy...
Yes.
You're weary and in need of rest...
So weary.
Tempted by the lust of flesh...
Yep!
And homosexuality.
Noooooo.
Just a hunch.
Son, I am reminded of Urkel's letter to the Alopecians.
You must trust in the Bruce Almighty, who brought forth the loaves and the fish, and the bubble gum, bubble gum in a dish.
How many pieces do you wish?
Reverend, how is this supposed to help me figure out who I am?
Don't worry, my son, you can always turn to the Father in your time of need.
My father...
Thanks, Reverend.
And I'll take some of that bubble gum.
Ooh, as ye Hubba, so shall ye Bubba!
Bye!
Uhp!
Seven years.
Dad, Mom, I have a question for you.
Young man, did you give me my kiss yet?
Yam, yam, yam.
Oh, that's better.
You were saying?
What happened in my past that makes people say I'm so white?
Well, we should probably tell you...
Cookie!
You got nothing to tell him.
You had the loving childhood everyone dreams about, fatass!
Now get out of my house!
Good-bye, Cleveland.
There's a woman who can answer your questions.
Remember this address.
One-two-three Main Street.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
One more time.
One... two... three...
Main Street.
Okay.
One-two is like 12, divided by three is four.
Four letters in "rain" which rhymes with "Main." Got it.
Why you hugging your momma so long?
No reason.
Bye.
One more time.
Cleveland Brown!
White lady I've never seen before!
I practically raised you, Cleveland.
I'm your Nanny Barbara.
What?
Look at you...
all grown up.
My Cleveland has come back to me.
Party over here!
We'll be white black.
Do you still like Arnold Palmers, Cleveland?
Well, I do, but only if I have an... almond biscotti.
Almond biscotti?
What kind of mind wizard are you?
Why don't I remember you?
Well, you were very young and when your father came back into your mother's life, I wasn't needed anymore.
And you always were a rather thick, unresponsive child, so it doesn't surprise me that you remember so little of those days.
Rhoda.
What?
We used to watch Mary Tyler Moore and her funny neighbor Rhoda.
Wait, what was funny about her again?
She was Jewish.
Oh my God, I remember!
You took me trick-or-treating.
You were Siskel and I was Ebert.
Now you're getting it.
Cleveland, it's time you get back to your roots!
Afternoon, Ms. Barbara.
Why, you're little Master Cleveland, all grown up!
You remember me?
No.
Good.
Good.
I'm telling you, I don't know how to...
Whoa.
Love-15.
Where did that come from?
Next thing, you'll tell me you don't know how to play bridge.
Overtrick, bitches!
Sorry, Elliot, Bunny.
Thank you, Barbara.
You've helped me figure out who I really am.
I want you to meet my family.
They're black.
I heard that!
Let's go!
Stuff from Trader Joe's!
You gave him Barbara's number, didn't you?
Family?
I know you have a lot of questions.
Now, remember the white woman of a certain age
I hustled through the living room into the kitchen 15 minutes ago saying, "No questions, no questions"?
I do.
Family, meet my childhood nanny, Barbara.
Hello, Freight Train.
Hello, Evelyn.
Barbara, how do you do?
Ha!
I'm just kidding.
I can interact with other human beings of different racial and ethnic backgrounds without losing my own identity.
Is that helpful?
Is that helpful to your husband who is trying to figure out who he is?
All right, I'll say it.
What the going on here?
I'll tell you what's going on.
This woman never did no good for nobody.
What did I tell you?
Barbara helped me raise Cleveland when Freight Train went out to get a pack of cigarettes for three and a half years.
You said you was gonna let that go.
Hey, you ever been married?
No.
I haven't met the right person.
Ohh...
Ohh...
There's a little vanilla on that Cookie.
There it is.
You happy, Tubby?
!
Humiliate me in front of my step-grandson?
!
You walking around like the rich guy on Gilligan.
Interesting fact.
None of them got rich because back then, actors didn't get residuals.
Heard that on NPR this morning.
Oh, please.
All this fuss 'cause you got embarrassed that your son liked Justin Bieber.
What?
You were embarrassed by me?
This is unprecedented.
I'm so upset, I could storm up to my room.
Everybody, calm down!
Let's remember what this is all about.
I am finally at peace with who I am.
Until next week, when you go to a P.F. Chang's and think you're Chinese 'cause you like fried rice.
Me so offended!
Oh, it's not my fault I'm confused.
Look what I came from!
Oh, boo-hoo.
"Am I black?
Am I white?"
You're the same thing you've always been... nothing.
Whoa.
Just got real.
You're wrong!
I am somebody!
I just don't know who!
I better go after him.

All tickets had was already had been sold.
Sold out.
Only prayer will be win ticket thank God by Justin Bieber Dance Competition, which would happen to happen tomorrow after today.

Thanks you, Dwayne.
In other news...
They're giving away Justin Bieber tickets?

I gotta win 'em!
For Junior...
of course.
Justin Bieber?
!
The only reason he's famous is from YouPorn.
I mean, Porn Tube.
Porn Hub.
Red Tube.
Bang Bus.
YouTube!
I'm lonely.
I'm sorry you're sad.
Well, I've got a competition to win for my son because I love him more than I love Justin Bieber.
I do love Junior.
He's no Justin Bieber, but...
We don't care, Cleveland.
We've got our own lives going on.
I can't pay my gas bill.
Tell your stories on your show.
Hey, yo!
What's up, Stoolbend?
!
It's your boy, DJ Charlie Chode Rock from your favorite station, 106.1 The Squirt!
And today, I'm up in the place to be with these fly guys and gals, ready to decide who's the ultimate Justin Bieber fan.
And here to kick things off, it's Justin Bieber himself live!
Via satellite!
What's up, tweens?
!
It's me, The Biebs, biebing at you live from your junior high school.
Go, football team!
Are you people ready for some dancing?
!
Yeah!
I gotta hop.
See you at the big dance!
Justin Bieber will not be at your dance, and that wasn't Justin Bieber.
Someday, I'll make you a real boy.
Okay, let's throw on some Bieber and let these ten contestants work it out to the chart-topping single, "Baby..."!

It's pretty clear who deserves these Justin Bieber tickets.
The winner of the Squirt 106.1 dance-off is
Cleveland Brown!
Who-- based on that dancing--
I have got to officially declare the whitest black man in America!
What?
!
But Wayne Brady's the whitest black man in America.
Not anymore, brother.
MAN On your right is the home of the whitest black man in America.
Damn it!
And on your left, Kendra from Hoarders.
I can't find my cat!
"Whitest Black Man in America," my foot.
"Whitest Black Man in America," my other foot.
Donna, you don't think
I'm the Whitest Black Man in America, do you?
No, honey.
What does that even mean?
May I take this?
It means you were dancing like a little white girl, so you could see a little white boy dance and sing for little white boys, white girls and a rainbow of pedophiles.
I was trying to win those tickets for Junior.
Keep me out of your freak show.
I really do want to go.
Look at you.
You still say things like,
"Party over here!" and "Too legit to quit!"
Yeah, boy-ee!
Gross!
You're a joke.
Stop teasing Cleveland...
who does always make sure to introduce his "one black friend from college"
to his "one black friend from work."
Reggie and Reggie became good friends.
And you are the only black person
I've ever seen eat trail mix.
It's barbecue-flavored trail mix.
I feel you, dawg.
Some people have called me the blackest white man in America.
No one calls you that.
Yeah, I don't think most people know you exist.
Cleveland, do you even know the difference between an African man and an African-American man?
Of course!
I know Tracy Morgan is an African because of his pot belly, droopy National Geographic boobies and flies.
Cleveland, that's a ridiculous stereotype!
And nobody is as filthy as Tracy Morgan.
Yeah, and you're always making jokes about Jewish people.
Black folks got enough to deal with.
We ain't got no time to differentiate between types of honkies.
Rallo!
Are you trying to get us killed?
!
That word is every bit as offensive to whites as the you-know-what word is to blacks.
No, it's not.
It's not even close.
But that kind of clueless hypersensitivity to racial matters is classic honky behavior.
Look, Cleveland, we were just joking around.
What difference does it make?
It makes a big difference to me!
I need to figure this out...
A-sap
What?
As soon as possible!
No longer will I be judged by the content of my character, but by the color of my skin!
For today, Cleveland Brown becomes a black man!
Oh, Lord.
Junior, you been eating my trail mix?
!
Nope, that was me.
My apologies, Cleve Lemon.
I thought I was eating garbage.

Yo, Donna!
I don't appreciate you sendin' your punk-ass, busta-ass,
Jheri curl wearing'-ass friends down here to shoot at me and my homies!
Cleveland, why are you quoting box office masterpiece Friday?
'Cause I'm a black man now, and that's what black people do.
Now, Donna, how come you ain't got no pictures of no brothas up on the wall?
Cleveland, that is your brother Broderick.
Blowin' by it!
Now, it's the hottest day of the year, there's racial tension everywhere, and we ain't patronizing your pizzeria till there's some brothas up on that wall!
Isn't that right, supporting actress Rosie Perez?
Yeah!
Do The Right Thing!
Aaaah!
Oh, my balled-up papers and toenails.
Oh, Cleveland, being black isn't about this stereotypical nonsense.
It's about being comfortable in your own skin.
You need help.
Well, since black people don't believe in therapy, I'm gonna go think on this while I wash my car in a public park.
Is that even a black stereotype?
!
I've seen 'em do it.
Oh, maybe I'll find what I'm looking for at church.
What was T-Pain doing here?
Thank you for meeting with me, Reverend.
I need guidance.
I don't know who I am.
Cleveland, I can tell your heart is heavy...
Yes.
You're weary and in need of rest...
So weary.
Tempted by the lust of flesh...
Yep!
And homosexuality.
Noooooo.
Just a hunch.
Son, I am reminded of Urkel's letter to the Alopecians.
You must trust in the Bruce Almighty, who brought forth the loaves and the fish, and the bubble gum, bubble gum in a dish.
How many pieces do you wish?
Reverend, how is this supposed to help me figure out who I am?
Don't worry, my son, you can always turn to the Father in your time of need.
My father...
Thanks, Reverend.
And I'll take some of that bubble gum.
Ooh, as ye Hubba, so shall ye Bubba!
Bye!
Uhp!
Seven years.
Dad, Mom, I have a question for you.
Young man, did you give me my kiss yet?
Yam, yam, yam.
Oh, that's better.
You were saying?
What happened in my past that makes people say I'm so white?
Well, we should probably tell you...
Cookie!
You got nothing to tell him.
You had the loving childhood everyone dreams about, fatass!
Now get out of my house!
Good-bye, Cleveland.
There's a woman who can answer your questions.
Remember this address.
One-two-three Main Street.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
One more time.
One... two... three...
Main Street.
Okay.
One-two is like 12, divided by three is four.
Four letters in "rain" which rhymes with "Main." Got it.
Why you hugging your momma so long?
No reason.
Bye.
One more time.
Cleveland Brown!
White lady I've never seen before!
I practically raised you, Cleveland.
I'm your Nanny Barbara.
What?
Look at you...
all grown up.
My Cleveland has come back to me.
Party over here!
We'll be white black.
Do you still like Arnold Palmers, Cleveland?
Well, I do, but only if I have an... almond biscotti.
Almond biscotti?
What kind of mind wizard are you?
Why don't I remember you?
Well, you were very young and when your father came back into your mother's life, I wasn't needed anymore.
And you always were a rather thick, unresponsive child, so it doesn't surprise me that you remember so little of those days.
Rhoda.
What?
We used to watch Mary Tyler Moore and her funny neighbor Rhoda.
Wait, what was funny about her again?
She was Jewish.
Oh my God, I remember!
You took me trick-or-treating.
You were Siskel and I was Ebert.
Now you're getting it.
Cleveland, it's time you get back to your roots!
Afternoon, Ms. Barbara.
Why, you're little Master Cleveland, all grown up!
You remember me?
No.
Good.
Good.
I'm telling you, I don't know how to...
Whoa.
Love-15.
Where did that come from?
Next thing, you'll tell me you don't know how to play bridge.
Overtrick, bitches!
Sorry, Elliot, Bunny.
Thank you, Barbara.
You've helped me figure out who I really am.
I want you to meet my family.
They're black.
I heard that!
Let's go!
Stuff from Trader Joe's!
You gave him Barbara's number, didn't you?
Family?
I know you have a lot of questions.
Now, remember the white woman of a certain age
I hustled through the living room into the kitchen 15 minutes ago saying, "No questions, no questions"?
I do.
Family, meet my childhood nanny, Barbara.
Hello, Freight Train.
Hello, Evelyn.
Barbara, how do you do?
Ha!
I'm just kidding.
I can interact with other human beings of different racial and ethnic backgrounds without losing my own identity.
Is that helpful?
Is that helpful to your husband who is trying to figure out who he is?
All right, I'll say it.
What the going on here?
I'll tell you what's going on.
This woman never did no good for nobody.
What did I tell you?
Barbara helped me raise Cleveland when Freight Train went out to get a pack of cigarettes for three and a half years.
You said you was gonna let that go.
Hey, you ever been married?
No.
I haven't met the right person.
Ohh...
Ohh...
There's a little vanilla on that Cookie.
There it is.
You happy, Tubby?
!
Humiliate me in front of my step-grandson?
!
You walking around like the rich guy on Gilligan.
Interesting fact.
None of them got rich because back then, actors didn't get residuals.
Heard that on NPR this morning.
Oh, please.
All this fuss 'cause you got embarrassed that your son liked Justin Bieber.
What?
You were embarrassed by me?
This is unprecedented.
I'm so upset, I could storm up to my room.
Everybody, calm down!
Let's remember what this is all about.
I am finally at peace with who I am.
Until next week, when you go to a P.F. Chang's and think you're Chinese 'cause you like fried rice.
Me so offended!
Oh, it's not my fault I'm confused.
Look what I came from!
Oh, boo-hoo.
"Am I black?
Am I white?"
You're the same thing you've always been... nothing.
Whoa.
Just got real.
You're wrong!
I am somebody!
I just don't know who!
I better go after him.

Party over here!
We'll be white black.
Do you still like Arnold Palmers, Cleveland?
Well, I do, but only if I have an... almond biscotti.
Almond biscotti?
What kind of mind wizard are you?
Why don't I remember you?
Well, you were very young and when your father came back into your mother's life, I wasn't needed anymore.
And you always were a rather thick, unresponsive child, so it doesn't surprise me that you remember so little of those days.
Rhoda.
What?
We used to watch Mary Tyler Moore and her funny neighbor Rhoda.
Wait, what was funny about her again?
She was Jewish.
(laughs)
Oh my God, I remember!
You took me trick-or-treating.
You were Siskel and I was Ebert.
Now you're getting it.
(laughs)
Cleveland, it's time you get back to your roots!
Afternoon, Ms. Barbara.
(gasps) Why, you're little Master Cleveland, all grown up!
You remember me?
No.
Good.
Good.
I'm telling you, I don't know how to...
Whoa.
Love-15.
(gasps) Where did that come from?
(chuckles)
Next thing, you'll tell me you don't know how to play bridge.
Overtrick, bitches!
Sorry, Elliot, Bunny.
Thank you, Barbara.
You've helped me figure out who I really am.
I want you to meet my family.
They're... (clears throat) ...black.
WAITER:
I heard that!
Let's go!
Stuff from Trader Joe's!
You gave him Barbara's number, didn't you?
Family?
I know you have a lot of questions.
Now, remember the white woman of a certain age
I hustled through the living room into the kitchen 15 minutes ago saying, "No questions, no questions"?
I do.
Family, meet my childhood nanny, Barbara.
Hello, Freight Train.
Hello, Evelyn.
(British accent):
Barbara, how do you do?
(normal voice):
Ha!
I'm just kidding.
I can interact with other human beings of different racial and ethnic backgrounds without losing my own identity.
Is that helpful?
Is that helpful to your husband who is trying to figure out who he is?
All right, I'll say it.
What the (bleep) going on here?
I'll tell you what's going on.
This woman never did no good for nobody.
What did I tell you?
Barbara helped me raise Cleveland when Freight Train went out to get a pack of cigarettes for three and a half years.
You said you was gonna let that go.
Hey, you ever been married?
No.
I haven't met the right person.
Ohh...
Ohh...
There's a little vanilla on that Cookie.
There it is.
You happy, Tubby?
!
Humiliate me in front of my step-grandson?
!
You walking around like the rich guy on Gilligan.
Interesting fact.
None of them got rich because back then, actors didn't get residuals.
Heard that on NPR this morning.
Oh, please.
All this fuss 'cause you got embarrassed that your son liked Justin Bieber.
What?
You were embarrassed by me?
This is unprecedented.
I'm so upset, I could storm up to my room.
Everybody, calm down!
Let's remember what this is all about.
I am finally at peace with who I am.
Until next week, when you go to a P.F. Chang's and think you're Chinese 'cause you like fried rice.
Me so offended!
Oh, it's not my fault I'm confused.
Look what I came from!
Oh, boo-hoo.
"Am I black?
Am I white?"
You're the same thing you've always been... nothing.
Whoa.
Just got real.
You're wrong!
I am somebody!
I just don't know who!
I better go after him.

But Wayne Brady's the whitest black man in America.
Not anymore, brother.

Damn it!
And on your left, Kendra from Hoarders.
KENDRA:
I can't find my cat!

"Whitest Black Man in America," my other foot.
Donna, you don't think
I'm the Whitest Black Man in America, do you?
No, honey.
What does that even mean?
May I take this?
It means you were dancing like a little white girl, so you could see a little white boy dance and sing for little white boys, white girls and a rainbow of pedophiles.
I was trying to win those tickets for Junior.
Keep me out of your freak show.
(whispers):
I really do want to go.
Look at you.
You still say things like,
"Party over here!" and "Too legit to quit!"
Yeah, boy-ee!
Gross!
You're a joke.
Stop teasing Cleveland...
who does always make sure to introduce his "one black friend from college"
to his "one black friend from work."
Reggie and Reggie became good friends.
And you are the only black person
I've ever seen eat trail mix.
It's barbecue-flavored trail mix.
I feel you, dawg.
Some people have called me the blackest white man in America.
No one calls you that.
Yeah, I don't think most people know you exist.
Cleveland, do you even know the difference between an African man and an African-American man?
Of course!
I know Tracy Morgan is an African because of his pot belly, droopy National Geographic boobies and flies.
Cleveland, that's a ridiculous stereotype!
And nobody is as filthy as Tracy Morgan.
Yeah, and you're always making jokes about Jewish people.
Black folks got enough to deal with.
We ain't got no time to differentiate between types of honkies.
Rallo!
Are you trying to get us killed?
!
That word is every bit as offensive to whites as the you-know-what word is to blacks.
No, it's not.
It's not even close.
But that kind of clueless hypersensitivity to racial matters is classic honky behavior.
Look, Cleveland, we were just joking around.
What difference does it make?
It makes a big difference to me!
I need to figure this out...
A-sap
What?
As soon as possible!
No longer will I be judged by the content of my character, but by the color of my skin!
For today, Cleveland Brown becomes a black man!
Oh, Lord.
Junior, you been eating my trail mix?
!
Nope, that was me.
My apologies, Cleve Lemon.
I thought I was eating garbage.

Cleveland, why are you quoting box office masterpiece Friday?

Now, Donna, how come you ain't got no pictures of no brothas up on the wall?
Cleveland, that is your brother Broderick.

Aaaah!
Oh, my balled-up papers and toenails.
Oh, Cleveland, being black isn't about this stereotypical nonsense.
It's about being comfortable in your own skin.
You need help.
Well, since black people don't believe in therapy, I'm gonna go think on this while I wash my car in a public park.
Is that even a black stereotype?
!
I've seen 'em do it.
Oh, maybe I'll find what I'm looking for at church.
What was T-Pain doing here?
Thank you for meeting with me, Reverend.
I need guidance.
I don't know who I am.
Cleveland, I can tell your heart is heavy...
Yes.
You're weary and in need of rest...
So weary.
Tempted by the lust of flesh...
Yep!
And homosexuality.
Noooooo.
Just a hunch.
Son, I am reminded of Urkel's letter to the Alopecians.
You must trust in the Bruce Almighty, who brought forth the loaves and the fish, and the bubble gum, bubble gum in a dish.
How many pieces do you wish?
Reverend, how is this supposed to help me figure out who I am?
Don't worry, my son, you can always turn to the Father in your time of need.
My father...
Thanks, Reverend.
And I'll take some of that bubble gum.
Ooh, as ye Hubba, so shall ye Bubba!
(chanting scream)
Bye!
Uhp!
Seven years.
Dad, Mom, I have a question for you.
Young man, did you give me my kiss yet?
Yam, yam, yam.
Oh, that's better.
You were saying?
What happened in my past that makes people say I'm so white?
Well, we should probably tell you...
Cookie!
You got nothing to tell him.
You had the loving childhood everyone dreams about, fatass!
Now get out of my house!
Good-bye, Cleveland.
There's a woman who can answer your questions.
Remember this address.
One-two-three Main Street.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
One more time.
One... two... three...
Main Street.
Okay.
One-two is like 12, divided by three is four.
Four letters in "rain" which rhymes with "Main." Got it.
Why you hugging your momma so long?
No reason.
Bye.

Did Shashi introduced you with any rich guy?
Rich guy you meant Armaan Kapoor
why dont you ask me straight away sir?
I wont get offended this is my job
i have never gone out with him but one of his friend was my customer
and there was once Armaan Kapoor come with him
Why you did not tell me this?
You never ask when did you meet him?
3 years back at that time he was not famous
NikhaI also brought one of his other friend there was another man with him

It's only the night that brings the forbidden to life
The streets open their arms to whoever passes by
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Yesterday in these very lanes, in these crushed flowers
There was such a high
Now only thirsty spirits, wracked in agony
Seem to wander by
All searching for the same thing
Not knowing the futility it will bring
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Between the lights and among the shadows
An unhappy secret exists
Why is it here?
What has happened for such anger to persist
Tell me oh dark night
Nothing escapes your sight
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Good morning, sir.
Devrath Kulkarni.
So what happened here?
An accident, sir.
The car crashed into the sea.
I've heard a lot about you... it's an honour to work with you.
The car came speeding down the road... and then it swerved... like...
like this... straight into the sea.
Where were you?
I was sitting over there.
Sir...
Pinky knew something was about to happen.
She warned us... but we ignored her.
Who is Pinky?
- Another witness.
- Hello, sir.
That was the only car on the road.
Anything else on the road?
There was absolutely nothing on the road... I saw it...
Sir, please come here.
- Get a stretcher.
That's Armaan Kapoor.
Check if there's any id.
The doors were locked... he was also wearing the seatbelt.
It is him.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
Move away... all of you.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Here.
What happened to Ramu, our driver?
is he...
Mr. Kapoor was driving... he was alone.
Alone?
What about Yuvraj?
His spotboy... he accompanies Armaan everywhere.
There was no one else in the car.
But, Armaan...
Armaan was never on his own.
I don't get it... why was he driving?
He hates driving.
Get Ramu and Yuvraj's number... talk to them.
Good morning, mom.
What's wrong, mom?
- Film starArmaan Kapoor met with an accident... last night on Seaface road.
He died in the crash.
- Seaface road is part of Mumbai's underbelly... famous for the red light area nearby.
It is not clear whatArmaan Kapoor...
- was doing here last night.
- Meanwhile Sonya Kapoor's brother, Teji Singh has stated that...
- the family is not satisfied with the police statement...
- that it was merely an accident.
Right now, we need time to deal with this tragedy...
- only then can we take any legal recourse.
- We still don't know what really happened.
What's wrong, Juhi?
Lost your husband?
Bhai...
Armaan Kapoor is dead.
What?
Armaan Kapoor, the actor... here on Seaface road.
Are you serious?
That's where l'm coming from... it's chaos down there.
The press is all over questioning the junkies.
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Whom did you meet?
Shut up!
You have only one good leg... how about I break that too?
Jinxed bastard...
always arrives with bad news.
Here, get us breakfast.
Move it!
Poor guy, you are so mean to him.
Never repeat what I say to you... in front of others.
Get it?
Sorry.
I said, I'm sorry!
- Sir, is the underworld involved in Armaan Kapoor's death?
- That's all the information we have right now.
I'm here outside Armaan Kapoor's place... he lived in an apartment on the top floor.
People have been pouring in to offer their condolences...
Where is Sonya?
She's upstairs.
Come in Devrath.
Sit.
Tell me.
Armaan Kapoor was shooting at Filmcity on the night of 4th March... for producer Deepak Lalwani's film... they were shooting on floor number 4.
They wrapped the shoot at around 2 AM.
- Pack up!
Good shot, Armaan.
- Both his driver and spotboy were with him at that time.
- Did you talk to them?
- Yes, sir.
- They said Armaan took 15 minutes to change.
- His staff went about routinely packing his things.
But, then something unusual happened.
- Armaan sent them both home from the studio...
- and he drove himself.
- Ramu... you go home, I'll drive myself.
- Come on...
- They also thought it was odd because Armaan didn't like to drive.
When did he leave from Filmcity?
At 2:20 AM.
The accident occurred at 4 AM.
How long does it take to get to Seaface road from Filmcity?
Probably 30 minutes, at night.
Even ifyou give it 45 minutes... where was he for an hour before the accident?
We don't know that yet, sir.
And Seaface road where the accident occurred... is not on his way home.
Inspector Shekhawat...
- Sir, I'm calling from The Times of India to confirm a story.
- Sources tell us that there's an unidentified number on Armaan Kapoor's mobile.
- ls it true that his last call--
His phone was destroyed by the water, it's in the workshop.
Who speaks to the press here?
Come on guys, who here knows journalists... you know, to help me leak a story?
Sir!
Devrath, confiscate their mobiles.
Your phones.
Quick!
This is a high profile case.
No talking to the media.
The autopsy and forensics details... any evidence we get... none of it is to be made public... until this case is solved.
is that clear?
I said, no talking to the media... you can talk to me.
Alright, back to work.
Sir!
I'm Rakesh Rane.
Yes, Rane?
I don't think this case will ever be solved... it's an A-final case, sir.
I mean... there have been similar accidents on that road in the past few years.
All freak accidents... put down as acts of providence... all unexplained.
We didn't get any evidence, whatsoever.
Finally one mystery is cleared... I know why so many officers transfer out ofthis station.
How's it going?
What's up?
Madamji.
Shashi bhai, where did you flick...
I mean buy the belt from?
You again!
Where you offto, Nirmala?
My clients want young girls... not old hags.
The rest ofyou...
let's go.
- Today's clients have flown in from Goa.
Don't listen to him.
You look really nice... I know.
What's the matter, Shashi?
You look tense...
something bothering you?
- Hey!
- Open up!
Shashi...
What were you doing?
Nothing... just trying to rile you up.
Look at you... guess I managed to!
- Shashi bhai, it's me...
Tehmur.
Here's the new sim card, Shashi bhai.
Take that in.
You changing your number?
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
I'm off to my village for a few days.
That's your answer if anyone asks.
Now get lost!
- Take me with you.
- lt's a work-trip...
- not a vacation.
Once it's done, I'II rush back to you.
But until then...
No one must know anything.
- But what was Armaan doing on Seaface road?
Suri, stop being secretive... give us the scoop.
It was an accident.
That's it.
Pass the water, please.
You actually met Sonya Kapoor?
- ls she as beautiful in real life?
- lt is so sad.
He was so young... no?
- He shouldn't have died.
Young people die all the time... but frankly no one--
Sorry.
Don't be silly... you don't need to apologise to us.
How's she doing now?
She's better.
I've spoken to a psychiatrist...
Anjali Punjabi.
Yes, she is quite good.
Yeah, I think it will help Roshni--
Can I get you something?
No, thanks.
Go back.
Stop.
The car was in perfect condition.
- The power brakes were working fine.
He braked here and then swerved... and crashed through those steps into the sea.
Seems like he was trying to avoid hitting something... but there was nothing on the road.
He wasn't drunk either.
Yes, sir.
The reports don't show any traces of alcohol or narcotics.
His lungs were filled with water.
- Cause of death is drowning.
- Sir... it seems like one of those A-final cases...
- none of it makes any sense.
Come on.
- Thousands have gathered on the streets to pay their last respects...
- to beloved bollywood actor Armaan Kapoor...
- Yes?
- Hello.
I'm Frenny Mistry... I live in the neighbourhood... thought I'd welcome you.
There was no need for this...
Darling, everybody needs cheese cake!
You need any help?
Oh no... I'm fine... just some boxes left to unpack.
Call me if you need anything... I have a number for everything.
Carpenter, electrician, plumber, anything you need... I know them all!
Thank you.
I would love some tea.
Of course, please sit.
So, you're alone at home all day... while your husband is out chasing robbers?
How long have you been married?
12 years.
- Milk and sugar?
Yes, dear...
- two spoons.
Hello, Karan.
Hello, Inspector.
Hello.
This is Sanjay...
Armaan's best friend.
Hello.
- Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Sonyaji, we still don't know where your husband was heading that night... or why he was on that road.
And the accident?
It's still a mystery why he steered the car off the road... and crashed into the sea.
Sonyaji... may I ask you something?
Sure.
Was something bothering Mr. Kapoor?
I mean, was he depressed or disturbed?
Armaan did not kill himself, Inspector.
- Why would he kill himself?
Because you can't figure out what really happened?
Just this morning my accountant told me... he had given Armaan 2 million rupees in cash that day.
Why?
We don't know.
- l gave him the money... at around 7:30 in the evening.
- Why didn't you inform Sonyaji about this before?
Sir, I did try... but she was in a state of shock, so I couldn't speak to her.
- Was the money in 500 rupee bills?
No, sir, 1000 rupee bills.
The money was in a green Puma bag.
But we didn't get any such bag in the car.
- Didn't you pack Armaan's stuffthat night?
What all was there?
His gym bag... music system, lunch box... and... a bag that the accountant gave him.
A red bag?
No, sir, a green one.
What was in it?
Did you open it?
No, sir, I never open his bags unless he asked me to.
Sure?
Yes, sir.
Did Mr. Kapoor tell you who the bag was for?
No.
Has this ever happened before?
Twice.
And once... about a year ago, on Mr. Kapoor's instructions... I personally dropped off 1 million rupees at Hotel Lido.
It's quite close to where...
the accident took place.
Why?
I don't know, sir.
I was instructed to... give the bag to the receptionist.
- Hello, sir.
What's the problem?
Anand Murugan used to work here, I want to know his whereabouts.
Murugan?
He was a receptionist here for 4 years.
Of course!
He quit and...
we haven't heard from him.
- ls it extortion?
- Sir, blackmail seems more likely.
If it were extortion he would've told someone about it... but, neither his wife nor his friends know anything.
is the blackmail connected to his death?
I don't think so... but there are a lot of unanswered questions.
Today Armaan's wife has filed an fir.
That's all we need right now.
Do we use the entire police force to solve this hero's case?
Sir, I think once we get to Murugan we'll have a lot more answers.
- Then find him quickly.
- Sir.
- Sir...
Shashi here.
- Where the hell have you been?
- l have been trying desperately to call you.
I had to change my number... need to lie low.
- What happened with Armaan that night?
How should I know?
I wasn't there.
- Don't bullshit me.
- The police know about the 2 million!
You handle them... now back to business... I was promised 5 million... you owe me 3 more.
Why are kids made to dance to film songs?
is there nothing better to do?
The kids were good.
- Roshni...
- Roshni!
Who is this lunatic?
- Hello dear.
- Hello.
This is my husband, Suri.
Hello...
This is Frenny, our neighbour.
She lives with her brother, Inspector Billimoria.
I've met your brother.
Poor you, dear.
Are you heading home?
Yes.
How are you, Surjan?
I'm fine, why?
Nothing... well...
actually, I wanted to meet you.
For a while now.
Well... I have a message for you.
Message?
From whom?
From your son...
Karan.
He wants me to tell you that... ls this a joke?
No, please hear me out...
Karan wants me to tell you that he wants to talk to you.
Shut up!
Just shut up!
We don't want to hear anything.
Stay away from us.
Get it?
I mean it!
Let's go.
Karan said...
'Tell Dada I am fine'.
'Not to worry.'
'Tell Dada I want to talk to him.'
How does she know Karan called you Dada?
Didn't you say... she barged in and asked personal questions.
But... I didn't mention anything about Karan to her.
I can't believe the things people do for money.
But what if it's true?
What?
What if... she really did talk to Karan?
Karan is dead, Roshni.
He can't talk to anyone.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Don't believe in such stuff, Roshni.
That's nonsense.
Please don't do this to yourself and me.
Suri, all I am saying is...
can we hear her only once-- l'm sorry, I can't have this conversation.
It's too ridiculous, I'm leaving.
Suri, please... only once--
Suri!
Dada...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
- Karan, don't wander too far off.
- Okay.
- Karan!
Karan!
- Suri, find him.
Karan!
- Karan!
Looks like you need some love.
I can take your pain away.
Save it for someone else... I'm a cop.
I've always had shitty luck... I'm only getting started for the night and you call it a day!
But, it's okay, officer... take me with you.
Arrest me!
How will that help?
When you're already in hell.
Perhaps... but I know the way to heaven.
- Right down this road...
Hotel Lido.
There's heaven in every room.
Hotel Lido, that place nearby?
The receptionist is a friend... he won't charge a thing.
Get in.
You men are all the same.
How long have you been working in Lido?
Seven years.
Do you know Murugan?
Anand Murugan?
He was a receptionist there.
Why?
I'm looking for him.
But... no one seems to know where he is.
Everyone know he is dying in Melur...
aids is bad for business.
So, the manager sent him away.
Thank you.
That's it?
That's it.
Don't shoo me off... I can really help you.
I'II find you when I need you... now go.
Missing me already?
What's your name?
Rosie.
Good night, Rosie.
Where can I find Anand Murugan?
That way.
Anand Murugan?
Sir, Devrath here.
- You were right, Murugan has AIDS.
- About a year ago he got a bag from Armaan Kapoor's accountant.
- For a guy called Shashi.
Now who's Shashi?
He's a pimp.
He works out of Hotel Lido.
Shashi gave Murugan Rs. 2000 for the bag.
I hope Murugan isn't lying.
I don't think so.
He is dying, why would he lie?
- Where is Shashi?
- He told me he was going to SangIi for some work.
What work?
That he didn't tell me.
When is he expected?
I don't know.
Listen to me...
Shashi is in trouble.
If you want to help him, tell me where he is.
Sir, I really don't know.
Did Shashi ever mention anything about Armaan Kapoor?
- Where is Shashi?
- l don't know.
- Haven't seen him around.
I heard he went back to his village.
Where is that?
You know, a place that has cows and bullock carts.
A village.
You're quite a good comedienne.
But, unfortunately for you... it's not easy to make me laugh.
You have two options.
Either you give us Shashi's address... or we can take a drive to the station.
Hold on.
You can'tjust arrest me.
Devrath, she really is funny... she's made me smile too.
Christina, get me my diary.
- Sir, Shashi didn't come here to Sangli.
Just as I thought.
You can come back.
Tell the cops there to keep an eye on his family.
We have to find this guy no matter what!
I need these pills.
Karan liked to play in water.
Ever since he was little.
When I'd get the water ready for his bath... he'd be so happy.
He would fill his mouth and spout water on me.
He wouldn't stop laughing!
Karan loved to be in water... did he have to drown and die?
Losing a child is a very traumatic experience.
I empathise with you... but life does take unexpected turns.
Sometimes we end up losing people that we love.
But we have to carry on.
Be patient, Roshni.
I can assure you that with the help of these sessions and medication... you will get out ofthis.
And you have your husband for support as weIl...
Along with Karan... I also lost Suri.
The fact is Suri needs your help more than I do.
I don't know what he thinks... or what he feels.
He doesn't talk to me.
You know... he never talks about Karan.
Never.
Do you feel Suri doesn't care?
No, he does care.
If he didn't... he'd be able to sleep.
My sadness is met with a silence from you
Time is to blame and that is the truth
Beat after beat a sorrow continues to stay
Then why does the heart still seem to say
Live a Iittle
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Yes this life has been full of pain
But there is a solace too that it contains I am yours and you are mine
And we hope that this won't ever change
Then why has the road that leads me to you broken down
Why are we meeting life with a frown
Come let's open the doors, let it all go
Let's cry our hearts out, let the tears flow
Live a Iittle
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Let the pain clouds drift away
Allow life to blossom a little each day
Leave the past where it belongs
And listen to what the heart has to say
Live a Iittle
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
- Sir, the guy in the yellow t-shirt is Tehmur, Shashi's confidant.
- He's walking towards you.
Alright.
Tehmur!
Me... sir?
You are Tehmur, right?
What do you do?
I'm a beggar.
I'm very poor...
don't even have enough to eat.
Sir, I haven't done anything...
- Sir, where are you taking me?
- Get him in!
- Speak up!
He's not talking.
Sir, I really don't know where Shashi is...
Sir, I swear I don't know anything.
Shut up!
Sir is an encounter specialist.
Afew days ago he shot dead some goons!
You better talk.
Sir, trust me, I really don't know anything.
What will you do if Shashi calls you?
I'II inform you.
What if you don't?
You can chop off my legs!
You can go.
Really?
Now get lost!
Shashi has never treated you well.
He treats you like a dog!
I suggest you come clean to Inspector Shekhawat.
And save yourself.
Pande, you know me well.
I'm not trying to help Shashi... nor am I being a hero.
I want to stay away from it all.
Shashi is into something big.
Shashi took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
He can't escape... sooner or later we will get him.
We're sorry.
The number you've reached is not in service.
Tehmur, give us some water.
- Shashi, You better listen to me.
- Stop calling me so many times.
- l told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
- Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
- lfyou want the money, don't call again.
Seen Shashi around?
No, sir... I knew you would be back.
Why?
Everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
You were right about Murugan.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Because cops don't really help the people here.
Cops treat everyone alike.
You're really funny, you know that?
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
That's not why I'm here.
Then, why are you here?
Don't lie to me.
I can sense you are lonely.
No fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I am not here to play games.
Do you know Shashi?
Shashi?
What's there to know?
He is a jerk.
Do you work for him?
I am one of his top girls.
Where is he right now?
I don't know.
I'm looking for him... will you help me?
Get your team to fill in for me... and I'll step in for them... as a cop.
Ifyou want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms... but how long can he stay submerged... sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Shashi is playing a big game this time... it involves millions.
So, tell the cops... to arrest him and chop his balls off!
No, it's time for my payback... I've done enough dirty work for him.
Shashi won't do anything for you.
He better.
He owes me.
I want to ask you something.
I need you to be sober when I say this... I need to be drunk to do my job.
Ask me...
Nirmala... lf l hit the big time... and make lots of money... will you marry me?
Did the cops hit you on your head?
Come on, answer me... will you come with me?
Stop building these castles in the air.
I'm a whore and I'll always be one... and you'll always be a whore's lame son!
Stay away from Shashi's rackets ifyou want to stay alive...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
Karan... wait... don't go...
Dada...
Let's play checkers instead.
Alright!
Who wants red?
- l...
- l!
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
- Okay.
Karan... wait... I'll come with you.
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I need your help.
Can you call my mom and dad?
I want to talk to them... their names are Roshni and Surjan.
Please tell them, I want to talk to them.
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I want to talk to my mom and dad...
Concentrate, my dear.
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
Hello mom... I'm right here with you... I'm happy that I'm speaking with you.
Thank you, mom.
Please tell dad that... I really want to talk to him... I know you and dad are sad because of me.
I am always with you...
Please don't cry, mom.
I want to see you smiling like this always.
I can sense you are lonely... no fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I knew you would be back... everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
I am not here to play games.
Then, why are you here?
Do you know Shashi?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms...
- What is it?
Some creep tied stones to a girl's body and threw it in the sea.
But how long can he stay submerged...
- The body did not surface for four days.
Sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Have you sent it for post-mortem?
No, sir, we're trying to get identification.
- What did you just say?
- Sir!
A girl's body has surfaced in Mahim Creek... the killer tied stones to her body before drowning her.
She was killed four days ago.
Devrath!
Send Shashi's photo and description to all morgues and hospitals... immediately!
- Last evening at approximately 8:30...
- a clean shot through the head...
- the killer was at a distance of almost 300 metres.
- The shell casing and gunshot wound prove that a .315 calibre rifle was used.
- Definitely a professional hit.
- We got these keys from his pocket, of a room at the golden Eyes hotel.
We recovered these things from his room... he had checked in as Krishna Nair.
He didn't have anything apart from his clothes... nothing to identify him.
Why is this so heavy?
When your time comes... there's nothing you can do about it.
What's with the long faces, guys?
Shashi bhai is dead.
What?
!
What rubbish?
It's true, he is dead.
Someone shot him last evening at the Mahim carnival.
But what was Shashi doing at the carnival anyway?
Shashi, you better listen to me... stop calling me over and over again.
I told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Shashi is into something big... he took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
Did Shashi have a green bag?
Did he?
I don't want to go back to that life...
Sorry, Mallika.
Madam is calling you.
Shashi paid her for me...
Move it.
- Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- tell them Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- Tehmur!
Armaan Kapoor?
Shashi bhai...
Come in, doctor... the bleeding hasn't stopped.
- Shashi, she needs to be taken to a hospital...
- No, no hospital...
fix her up here... lfyou ever say a word about this... I will break your face.
Get it?
Shashi bhai, thanks for the payback.
We had to report to the income-tax department because the 2 million was in cash.
You'll have to apply for a refund.
How did Armaan know...
that guy Shashi?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
Why was he bIackmailing Armaan?
Sonya, he said he doesn't know.
You think it's possible that...
Armaan was using prostitutes?
Sonya, please... I want to know the truth.
I'm not really sure... but, yes it's possible.
Hello?
I'm Shashi's friend.
Excuse me.
Who is this?
- l just told you!
Remember Shashi?
You called him to the carnival... and you killed him.
I'm in a meeting right now... let me call you back in some time.
Please, don't bother... I'll call you back in an hour... you better answer or you will regret it.
Okay.
He's taken the bait!
Jackpot!
Who would have thought you were so smart, Tehmur?
Tell me... I want five million.
What?
What for?
To keep your secret safe.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, don't waste my time.
Okay then, you'll hear from the cops... once they get Shashi's phone sim and the DVD.
- lfthat's not good enough... I know about the girl too.
I'm in trouble, dad.
It's a real mess.
What is it?
Armaan and I... some people have been blackmailing us.
What?
Who are these people?
Do you remember Nikhil's accident?
Of course.
He didn't fall from the balcony of our Juhu bungalow... I lied to you.
Actually, he fell off a moving car... it was an accident, dad.
How come you're home so early!
Are you complaining?
Suri!
Do you have to go back?
No.
Then let's go out.
Where?
Let's go for a movie... and then we'll eat out...
Please, Suri... come on...
Please!
I couldn't stop laughing!
How did you like the film?
I was watching you, actually... it's good to see you happy.
Thank you, Roshni...
For seeing the therapist... I know it can't be easy for you... but I think it's really helping you.
- Hi Roshni aunty...
- Samar!
What brings you to Mumbai?
My cousin is getting married next week... I was going to call you...
Samar's been looking forward to seeing you.
Ifyou're free one evening, come over... have dinner with us.
Sure, why not!
How about Friday?
I'm working late on Friday.
What about Saturday?
actually, I'm busy all week...
I'm working on a new case, sorry, I'm really pressed for time.
No problem... you cops do work long hours.
I can't believe you did that!
They must have felt so bad... they are our friends, Suri.
That doesn't mean I have to meet them... I'm not stopping you from meeting them.
Every time I look at Samar...
He is only a child, Suri... what happened wasn't his fault.
I know... the fault was mine.
It was an accident, Suri.
No, it was negligence... on my part.
Instead of keeping an eye on them, I fell asleep.
So did I... we didn't know the kids would do something like that.
Please, Suri.
Don't blame yourself.
You can say what you want now, Roshni... but I know how you look at me sometimes...
But... I've never blamed you... I've never thought like this...
But I do... every single day.
Don't... you mustn't blame yourself... come on... let's go in and talk.
No, I've got some work.
Please, Suri.
Suri...
This illness you have ofthe heart
I don't seem to understand at all
You abandon everything that's near and dear
And what remains distant you seem to call
My heart is listless!
Without you.
I don't know why
And I don't know how
There exists an invisible tension
One that tugs
One that leads
One that tugs One that leads
Me in your direction I am the mystery I am that story
That doesn't have an end
Come closer and you shall see
The distance remains and is meant to be
My heart is listless!
Without you.
What I haven't been able to unravel ls the riddle that you are
No one knows the secret
The secret who's friend you are I smile, and hide from the world
How restless I am day and night
It's been a while since I shut my eyes
Been a while since I felt peace inside
My heart is listless!
Without you.
Don't you ever go home?
And when do you sleep?
Hmm?
I need to ask you something... I'II come back later ifyou are busy.
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
How does it matter?
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here... lsn't it peaceful here?
Why are you so sad?
What makes you say that?
Fine, you don't have to talk about it.
Let's talk about something else... how's the investigation going?
I heard Shashi was killed.
I don't know what I am looking for.
Every clue seems to lead to a blank... I feel like the answers are staring me in the face... but I can't see them.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Did Shashi ever make you meet... anyone famous?
Meet anyone famous?
You want to know if I slept with Armaan Kapoor?
Then ask me straight... I won't be offended... it's myjob.
The answer is no... but his friend was a regular client.
And I met Armaan once with him.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
You never asked me.
When was this?
Three years ago...
Armaan wasn't as famous back then...
He came with NikhiI, his friend.
There was another guy with them.
We went for a drive...
That's all.
This other guy... was his name Sanjay Kejriwal?
I don't know his name... but I'd recognise him if I saw him.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
Ifyou want to get out... I can help you.
I know.
But not yet... there are some things I need to take care of... let me get done with that.
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
I have to say... you're really different.
Trust me, you don't belong here either.
How's that?
Well, you actually care about people... without wanting anything in return.
Not too many people like that around here.
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
No one's heard of her since... no one knows if she is dead or alive... and no one cares.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
Did you report it to the cops?
Are you crazy?
I think I should remind you about the laws in our country.
Prostitution is still illegal.
We don't even exist... and if we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Hello, I'm Inspector Shekhawat... and I'm here to see Nikhil Deshpande.
He wants to meet Nikhil.
NikhiI... look, someone's come to see you.
Doctors are not sure how much he can understand...
He understands everything, I know it.
- He hasn't spoken since the accident.
The profits recorded went up by 8 percent... and, this trend indicates that... there is a substantial growth in this sector.
And, according to--
Hello?
hold on for a second...
Guys...
I have to take this call so... please continue...
Okay, as I was saying... according to this trend... I want to meet with you.
You got the money?
Are you listening to me?
I want to meet--
You think I'm an idiot?
I know what happened to Shashi.
I didn't kill Shashi.
I was at the carnival with the money... waiting for Shashi.
I've been paying him off for years, why would I have him killed?
I can ruin you in a matter of hours...
What will you get out of it?
Think about it...
- lf you're ready to meet, I will bring the money... at a place and time of your choice.
Why are the lights switched off...
Come...
Devrath, come in...
This way, Devrath...
Nice house, sir.
Roshni...
Looks like my wife is out...
Would you like a drink?
I don't mind...
Whisky, right?
Yes, sir.
Soda or water?
Water, sir...
And ice?
Okay.
Sorry, Devrath... I think Roshni forgot that you were coming over for dinner... she's out for a film with a friend.
It's okay, sir.
Hello Suri, how're you doing?
Sorry to disturb your film, but I need to speak with Roshni...
- l can't get through her phone.
What film?
- Roshni's not with me, Suri.
- ls everything okay?
Yeah...
I'm sorry...
I got it wrong... it slipped my mind, sorry...
Devrath, do you know where Billimoria lives?
Sir... block-2, ground floor...
What's wrong, sir?
Sir...
Where is Roshni?
She's inside...
you have to wait here.
You can't go in there...
Sir... you can't...
Suri... I warned you to stay away... didn't I?
Suri... stop it...
Have you lost it, Roshni?
What are you doing here?
Karan is dead, he can't talk to you.
I don't blame you for your anger, it comes from the pain within--
That's enough!
Ifyou can really talk to Karan, tell him to appear now... I want to see him...
where is he?
I can't do that.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form... but Karan didn't have a problem moving to the afterlife... he had a smooth passage.
Unbelievable!
A smooth passage?
He was only 8 and he drowned to death!
How smooth is that?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
I didn't choose this life... it chose me.
- Let's go...
- No, Surjan... listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
When my husband died, I was very depressed... and that's when the spirits started communicating with me.
Let's go!
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
- Stop it, Suri, Iet go of me!
Stop it!
Suri!
How could you lie to me?
You hid all this from me?
How can I tell you the truth?
You are never home.
Don't change the subject.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
You're highly educated...
you taught science to kids... think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
I don't know what I believe... but I know she has told me things... that only Karan knew about.
It makes me happy... why don't you understand?
Suri...
Karan wants to talk to you!
You've lost it completely, Roshni.
You need help.
I don't need help... I need to talk to you...
Can you talk to me?
Can you stay home one night with me?
Can we live like a couple and not like strangers?
I'II see you later, sir.
Hold on!
You work with him, right?
Are you also out every night?
is your wife okay that you never come home?
Where do you go, Suri?
Have I ever asked you?
Who are you with every night?
I know you are not working... I know you are with someone.
I don't know where you go or what you do... but it keeps you going... it makes you happy.
So why can't I do something that gives me peace and happiness?
See you later, sir.
All couples go through phases...
Suri and you have been through hell... give it time...
this too shall pass.
I don't think so.
Have you thought about having another child?
Suri would not hear of it.
I tried bringing it up but... he didn't want to talk about it.
I think he is having an affair.
What?
No way... that's impossible...
Roshni, we're talking about Suri.
I asked him straight out... he didn't even deny it.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Are you falling for me, officer?
I'm kidding!
What do you want to ask me?
Are you... are you okay?
I am very tired...
Come with me... come on...
Please don't misunderstand... I just want to talk.
If someone says that to me... I suppose, I should be offended.
Come here... I won't bite.
This is my wife, Roshni... and this is Karan... my son.
Your wife is very beautiful.
Roshni and I were very happy...
What happened then?
Karan... ls anyone really happy?
Are you happy?
I have my moments.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Try me...
Some other time perhaps...
Can you do me a favour, please?
What?
Remember Mallika?
Shashi's girlfriend?
Yeah...
She is in a mess... can you help her?
What happened to her?
Close your eyes...
Hey you... get MaIIika.
Okay, sir.
Where's Mallika?
For today I'm MaIIika... what do you want?
Police business, get her.
She's out.
call her out or I'II come back with a warrant... and that will be the end of you.
Who did this to you?
Shashi paid her off for me... now she denies it... and is forcing me back to work.
Ifyou want to get out of here, sit in the car.
They won't let me leave...
Don't worry about them...
get in the car.
Trust me... don't be scared.
Where do you think you're going?
Go stop her!
Come back here...
Let me file these papers.
She is a good woman.
She will help you.
Sir... thank you.
Don't thank me, thank Rosie... she told me about you.
Rosie?
Who's she?
She is one of Madam's girls.
I don't know who you're talking about...
That's how it is with us girls...
today Rosie, tomorrow Jasmine.
That's how we play it.
Sir... I...
lied to you earlier.
Shashi knewArmaan Kapoor.
Shashi metArmaan Kapoor... on the night of his accident.
Do you know why?
I never meddled in his work.
But, you know what... you should get hold of that slime Tehmur... I'm sure he knows something.
After everything Shashi did for him...
Tehmur... help me...
- The creep didn't raise a finger to help me.
Tehmur, don't do this...
Shashi was like a brother to you.
- He was trying to steal Shashi's stuff.
What stuff?
It was a green bag... which Shashi had got home that night.
Tomorrow morning at 11:15 at Churchgate station, come alone.
- Bring the money with you... I'II call you with more instructions...
One more thing...
- if I meet with Shashi's fate... whether you're responsible for it or not, the cops will get the stuff.
Fine.
I've to work...
what is it?
I need your help...
My help?
I can't trust anyone but you.
Hold it!
I don't want to get into any mess.
Nirmala... lf this plan works out... you and I can get out of here.
Free as birds... think about it.
I don't know who is the bigger fool... you or I...
Tehmur!
Hello?
Listen carefully... there is a restroom to your right... you'll see a blue bag under the basin, dump the money into it.
- Get it?
Yeah...
- Then head to platform number 4... the train for Virar leaves in 5 minutes...
- get into the compartment next to the first class.
Hurry up, you don't want to miss the train.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Hi darling!
That's a... nice bag...
Who you are working for?
Tell me... I'II make it worth your while.
I can give you a lot more.
Listen!
You're making a mistake.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Where there is happiness ln its shadow I reside
And those who smile
Also have a tear in their eye
Wherever you go
Beneath you the same ground will lie
And above you the same sky I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
I need your help... I can't trust anyone but you.
I don't know who's the bigger fool...
you or I...
Listen...
You have to pretend... not to know me.
Don't talk to me... in fact, don't even look at me.
Corner him!
Catch him!
Where's the money, you jerk!
This guy is operating on his own...
- he confessed everything...
- he worked For Shashi... and happened to stumble upon this...
- he doesn't even know your name...
- he got your number from Shashi's sim card.
Finish him off...
- You will get the rest of your money... and don't call me ever again.
Did you ever think of me?
Did you... even once?
I haven't done anything...
You claimed to be my friend... I did nothing...
Over there...
they pushed him... I will join you on the train.
But if I don't get there... don't wait for me.
Get on the train, come what may.
You've got to be on that train, okay?
!
Simran...
- He said Simran...
- Simran?
Yes, sir, he said Simran... and died.
Sir, the hospital called... that goon is conscious... we can take his statement, should I go?
No, I'II go.
Now listen... you and Rane go to the brothel.
Apparently Tehmur mentioned a 'Simran' before he died...
Find out who this girl is that Tehmur knew... probably one of Madam's girls, bring her in.
It's in your best interest to cooperate with me... or else, the lockup is where you'll be.
Sir is talking to you...
Sir!
the patient is still critical.
- Leave the room...
- But, sir...
Let me do my job.
Get out!
Out!
No one can help you now!
Ifyou are lucky enough to survive... here's what will happen.
I'II take you into my custody and question you... and I have a way of getting the truth.
Then I'll file a case against you... for Tehmur's murder... and I'll make sure you get the death penalty for killing him.
I guarantee you that.
Tehmur was a key police witness... and you were caught red-handed.
Think about it... if you cooperate... I'll save you from the death penalty.
Tell me, who hired you to clear their mess?
Ghorpade, take him into our custody.
I think he prefers to be there.
Sir... the doctor said he can't be discharged...
Tell the doctor he didn't say anything like that.
I want this man in my custody today.
Do whatever it takes.
Yes, sir.
Gokhale... get started... remove these pipes and tubes...
Sanjay KejriwaI!
What?
Sanjay KejriwaI.
Sir, there's no Simran here.
No, sir... a few girls said there was someone called Simran... but she ran away some years ago.
Where could she have gone?
Someone has to know... it's possible that she is still there... and the other girls are trying to protect her.
Tell Rane to stay there and keep looking.
Okay, sir.
- You go to the police station... and meet me at Sanjay Kejriwal's bungalow with a team.
Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
This way, sir.
Inspector Shekhawat!
What brings you here?
Mr. Kejriwal, I have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
On what basis?
For getting Tehmur and Shashi murdered.
Babu Tipnis... you know him already...
He has signed an affidavit implicating you... you have to come with us.
Hand over your mobile phone, please.
Now!
Let's go.
Come on, stand up.
- l said stand up!
- please... just a minute.
Can we talk?
Go ahead.
In private?
I'm afraid not.
He was blackmailing us... lt all started three years ago.
Armaan, me and our friend, Nikhil...
- were out one night.
I know what we can take to the bachelor party...
NikhiI knew Shashi...
- go to Hotel Lido...
Hello Shashi...
- We went with him to Hotel Lido...
- and there we picked up a girl.
I wasn't happy about it.
What was the girl's name?
Simran.
Nikhil started messing with the girl in the car...
How about a trial...
- What happened next?
I don't know...
- probably the back door wasn't locked properly... lt was an accident!
NikhiI!
Shit!
NikhiI!
Be careful...
- Easy...
- Okay...
Armaan, get into the car now!
Sanjay, we can't leave her in this state...
Dude, you're asking for trouble... we'll get screwed because of this hooker.
Get in the car...
- Please!
- Sanjay?
- Sanjay, we can't leave her here...
what if she dies...
Call that guy, Shashi...
Call Shashi, he will handle it...
Oh God!
Shashi called Armaan a week later... and sent him a DVD... it had footage from the security camera at Hotel Lido... of the three of us leaving the lobby with the girl.
Shashi told us the girl was dead... and he had buried her body somewhere.
Where's the DVD?
I know her, she's the one who has been helping me.
You mean, she is... alive?
Yes, Mr. Kejriwal, I've met her several times... I think Shashi and the girl conned you.
But sir, if that's the case, why would she help you?
Only she can answer that.
Devrath, head to Hotel Lido right now... she might be there... she goes by the name of Rosie nowadays, not Simran... and inform Rane as well.
Get her to the police station immediately.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
If you had informed the police right at the beginning... it would've saved many lives... probably your friend, Armaan's too.
So much happened...
and all for what?
Look out!
- Sir...
- l think only I can see her...
Have you lost your mind, Shekhawat?
Next thing you'll tell me...
is that you saw a ghost!
Don't misunderstand me... I and the police department value you tremendously... but there's talk going on about you that could ruin your career.
Your subordinates have been saying that you don't sleep at night... keep driving all night... you talk to yourself...
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Think about your future, Shekhawat... if you mention this in your official report... you know what's going to happen... you'll be the laughing stock of the department.
I think... you should take a break for two months... you really need it.
But what about the truth?
The truth is that...
Sanjay KejriwaI decided to end his life instead of going to jail.
Armaan Kapoor died in an accident that can only be an act of providence.
And the two men blackmaiIing them... they're dead.
Case closed!
This is the truth and this will go as your official statement.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
No, Surjan, listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
I can take your pain away.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
Ifyou want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I knew you would be back.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form.
If we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here...
Why don't you understand, Suri?
Karan wants to talk to you!
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
Hello dad, I miss you... I know you miss me a lot too...
What happened that day was not your fault... it was my fault, dad... I am sorry.
There was nothing you could have done to change it... this is what I had to tell you...
Please don't blame yourself... because that makes me very sad.
Please don't fight with mom because of me.
I can never be happy if both of you are so unhappy.
Dad, do you remember telling me... that you always wanted to see me happy?
I know I can count on you to make everything okay... because you are the best dad in the world.
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here ln my every thought
Every word spoken ln my every feeling
My every emotion
There is only you
You are everywhere
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
You never really left my side
You hold my hand even today
No matter what the destination is
You will be my fellow traveller
All the way
The world may say you are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say you are gone
But you are here
You are right here
It's only the night that brings the forbidden to life
The streets open their arms to whoever passes by
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Yesterday in these very lanes, in these crushed flowers
There was such a high
Now only thirsty spirits, wracked in agony
Seem to wander by
All searching for the same thing
Not knowing the futility it will bring
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Between the lights and among the shadows
An unhappy secret exists
Why is it here?
What has happened for such anger to persist
Tell me oh dark night
Nothing escapes your sight
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Good morning, sir.
Devrath Kulkarni.
So what happened here?
An accident, sir.
The car crashed into the sea.
I've heard a lot about you... it's an honour to work with you.
The car came speeding down the road... and then it swerved... like...
like this... straight into the sea.
Where were you?
I was sitting over there.
Sir...
Pinky knew something was about to happen.
She warned us... but we ignored her.
Who is Pinky?
- Another witness.
- Hello, sir.
That was the only car on the road.
Anything else on the road?
There was absolutely nothing on the road... I saw it...
Sir, please come here.
- Get a stretcher.
That's Armaan Kapoor.
Check if there's any id.
The doors were locked... he was also wearing the seatbelt.
It is him.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
Move away... all of you.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Here.
What happened to Ramu, our driver?
is he...
Mr. Kapoor was driving... he was alone.
Alone?
What about Yuvraj?
His spotboy... he accompanies Armaan everywhere.
There was no one else in the car.
But, Armaan...
Armaan was never on his own.
I don't get it... why was he driving?
He hates driving.
Get Ramu and Yuvraj's number... talk to them.
Good morning, mom.
What's wrong, mom?
- Film star Armaan Kapoor met with an accident... last night on Seaface road.
He died in the crash.
- Seaface road is part of Mumbai's underbelly... famous for the red light area nearby.
It is not clear what Armaan Kapoor...
- was doing here last night.
- Meanwhile Sonya Kapoor's brother, Teji Singh has stated that...
- the family is not satisfied with the police statement...
- that it was merely an accident.
Right now, we need time to deal with this tragedy...
- only then can we take any legal recourse.
- We still don't know what really happened.
What's wrong, Juhi?
Lost your husband?
Bhai...
Bhai...
Armaan Kapoor is dead.
What?
Armaan Kapoor, the actor... here on Seaface road.
Are you serious?
That's where l'm coming from... it's chaos down there.
The press is all over questioning the junkies.
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Whom did you meet?
Shut up!
You have only one good leg... how about I break that too?
Jinxed bastard...
always arrives with bad news.
Here, get us breakfast.
Move it!
Poor guy, you are so mean to him.
Never repeat what I say to you... in front of others.
Get it?
Sorry.
I said, I'm sorry!
- Sir, is the underworld involved in Armaan Kapoor's death?
- That's all the information we have right now.
I'm here outside Armaan Kapoor's place... he lived in an apartment on the top floor.
People have been pouring in to offer their condolences...
Where is Sonya?
She's upstairs.
Come in Devrath.
Sit.
Tell me.
Armaan Kapoor was shooting at Filmcity on the night of 4th March... for producer Deepak Lalwani's film... they were shooting on floor number 4.
They wrapped the shoot at around 2 AM.
- Pack up!
Good shot, Armaan.
- Both his driver and spotboy were with him at that time.
- Did you talk to them?
- Yes, sir.
- They said Armaan took 15 minutes to change.
- His staff went about routinely packing his things.
But, then something unusual happened.
- Armaan sent them both home from the studio...
- and he drove himself.
- Ramu... you go home, I'll drive myself.
- Come on...
- They also thought it was odd because Armaan didn't like to drive.
When did he leave from Filmcity?
At 2:20 AM.
The accident occurred at 4 AM.
How long does it take to get to Seaface road from Filmcity?
Probably 30 minutes, at night.
Even if you give it 45 minutes... where was he for an hour before the accident?
We don't know that yet, sir.
And Seaface road where the accident occurred... is not on his way home.
Inspector Shekhawat...
- Sir, I'm calling from The Times of India to confirm a story.
- Sources tell us that there's an unidentified number on Armaan Kapoor's mobile.
- ls it true that his last call--
His phone was destroyed by the water, it's in the workshop.
Who speaks to the press here?
Come on guys, who here knows journalists... you know, to help me leak a story?
Sir!
Devrath, confiscate their mobiles.
Your phones.
Quick!
This is a high profile case.
No talking to the media.
The autopsy and forensics details... any evidence we get... none of it is to be made public... until this case is solved.
is that clear?
I said, no talking to the media... you can talk to me.
Alright, back to work.
Sir!
I'm Rakesh Rane.
Yes, Rane?
I don't think this case will ever be solved... it's an A-final case, sir.
I mean... there have been similar accidents on that road in the past few years.
All freak accidents... put down as acts of providence... all unexplained.
We didn't get any evidence, whatsoever.
Finally one mystery is cleared... I know why so many officers transfer out of this station.
How's it going?
What's up?
Madamji.
Shashi bhai, where did you flick...
I mean buy the belt from?
You again!
Where you off to, Nirmala?
My clients want young girls... not old hags.
The rest of you...
let's go.
- Today's clients have flown in from Goa.
Don't listen to him.
You look really nice... I know.
What's the matter, Shashi?
You look tense...
something bothering you?
- Hey!
- Open up!
Shashi...
What were you doing?
Nothing... just trying to rile you up.
Look at you... guess I managed to!
- Shashi bhai, it's me...
Tehmur.
Here's the new sim card, Shashi bhai.
Take that in.
You changing your number?
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
I'm off to my village for a few days.
That's your answer if anyone asks.
Now get lost!
- Take me with you.
- lt's a work-trip...
- not a vacation.
Once it's done, I'll rush back to you.
But until then...
No one must know anything.
- But what was Armaan doing on Seaface road?
Suri, stop being secretive... give us the scoop.
It was an accident.
That's it.
Pass the water, please.
You actually met Sonya Kapoor?
- ls she as beautiful in real life?
- lt is so sad.
He was so young... no?
- He shouldn't have died.
Young people die all the time... but frankly no one--
Sorry.
Don't be silly... you don't need to apologise to us.
How's she doing now?
She's better.
I've spoken to a psychiatrist...
Anjali Punjabi.
Yes, she is quite good.
Yeah, I think it will help Roshni--
Can I get you something?
No, thanks.
Go back.
Stop.
The car was in perfect condition.
- The power brakes were working fine.
He braked here and then swerved... and crashed through those steps into the sea.
Seems like he was trying to avoid hitting something... but there was nothing on the road.
He wasn't drunk either.
Yes, sir.
The reports don't show any traces of alcohol or narcotics.
His lungs were filled with water.
- Cause of death is drowning.
- Sir... it seems like one of those A-final cases...
- none of it makes any sense.
Come on.
- Thousands have gathered on the streets to pay their last respects...
- to beloved Bollywood actor Armaan Kapoor...
- Yes?
- Hello.
I'm Frenny Mistry... I live in the neighbourhood... thought I'd welcome you.
There was no need for this...
Darling, everybody needs cheese cake!
You need any help?
Oh no... I'm fine... just some boxes left to unpack.
Call me if you need anything... I have a number for everything.
Carpenter, electrician, plumber, anything you need... I know them all!
Thank you.
I would love some tea.
Of course, please sit.
So, you're alone at home all day... while your husband is out chasing robbers?
How long have you been married?
12 years.
- Milk and sugar?
Yes, dear...
- two spoons.
Hello, Karan.
Hello, Inspector.
Hello.
This is Sanjay...
Armaan's best friend.
Hello.
- Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Sonyaji, we still don't know where your husband was heading that night... or why he was on that road.
And the accident?
It's still a mystery why he steered the car off the road... and crashed into the sea.
Sonyaji... may I ask you something?
Sure.
Was something bothering Mr. Kapoor?
I mean, was he depressed or disturbed?
Armaan did not kill himself, Inspector.
- Why would he kill himself?
Because you can't figure out what really happened?
Just this morning my accountant told me... he had given Armaan 2 million rupees in cash that day.
Why?
We don't know.
- l gave him the money... at around 7:30 in the evening.
- Why didn't you inform Sonyaji about this before?
Sir, I did try... but she was in a state of shock, so I couldn't speak to her.
- Was the money in 500 rupee bills?
No, sir, 1000 rupee bills.
The money was in a green Puma bag.
But we didn't get any such bag in the car.
- Didn't you pack Armaan's stuff that night?
What all was there?
His gym bag... music system, lunch box... and... a bag that the accountant gave him.
A red bag?
No, sir, a green one.
What was in it?
Did you open it?
No, sir, I never open his bags unless he asked me to.
Sure?
Yes, sir.
Did Mr. Kapoor tell you who the bag was for?
No.
Has this ever happened before?
Twice.
And once... about a year ago, on Mr. Kapoor's instructions... I personally dropped off 1 million rupees at Hotel Lido.
It's quite close to where...
the accident took place.
Why?
I don't know, sir.
I was instructed to... give the bag to the receptionist.
- Hello, sir.
What's the problem?
Anand Murugan used to work here, I want to know his whereabouts.
Murugan?
He was a receptionist here for 4 years.
Of course!
He quit and...
we haven't heard from him.
- ls it extortion?
- Sir, blackmail seems more likely.
If it were extortion he would've told someone about it... but, neither his wife nor his friends know anything.
is the blackmail connected to his death?
I don't think so... but there are a lot of unanswered questions.
Today Armaan's wife has filed an fir.
That's all we need right now.
Do we use the entire police force to solve this hero's case?
Sir, I think once we get to Murugan we'll have a lot more answers.
- Then find him quickly.
- Sir.
- Sir...
Shashi here.
- Where the hell have you been?
- l have been trying desperately to call you.
I had to change my number... need to lie low.
- What happened with Armaan that night?
How should I know?
I wasn't there.
- Don't bullshit me.
- The police know about the 2 million!
You handle them... now back to business... I was promised 5 million... you owe me 3 more.
Why are kids made to dance to film songs?
is there nothing better to do?
The kids were good.
- Roshni...
- Roshni!
- Roshni!
Who is this lunatic?
- Hello dear.
- Hello.
This is my husband, Suri.
Hello...
This is Frenny, our neighbour.
She lives with her brother, Inspector Billimoria.
I've met your brother.
Poor you, dear.
Are you heading home?
Yes.
How are you, Surjan?
I'm fine, why?
Nothing... well...
Actually, I wanted to meet you.
For a while now.
Well... I have a message for you.
Message?
From whom?
From your son...
Karan.
He wants me to tell you that... ls this a joke?
No, please hear me out...
Karan wants me to tell you that he wants to talk to you.
Shut up!
Just shut up!
We don't want to hear anything.
Stay away from us.
Get it?
I mean it!
Let's go.
Karan said...
'Tell Dada I am fine'.
'Not to worry.'
'Tell Dada I want to talk to him.'
How does she know Karan called you Dada?
Didn't you say... she barged in and asked personal questions.
But... I didn't mention anything about Karan to her.
I can't believe the things people do for money.
But what if it's true?
What?
What if... she really did talk to Karan?
Karan is dead, Roshni.
He can't talk to anyone.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Don't believe in such stuff, Roshni.
That's nonsense.
Please don't do this to yourself and me.
Suri, all I am saying is...
can we hear her only once-- l'm sorry, I can't have this conversation.
It's too ridiculous, I'm leaving.
Suri, please... only once--
Suri!
Dada...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
- Karan, don't wander too far off.
- Okay.
- Karan!
- Karan!
Karan!
- Suri, find him.
Karan!
- Karan!
Looks like you need some love.
I can take your pain away.
Save it for someone else... I'm a cop.
I've always had shitty luck... I'm only getting started for the night and you call it a day!
But, it's okay, officer... take me with you.
Arrest me!
How will that help?
When you're already in hell.
Perhaps... but I know the way to heaven.
- Right down this road...
Hotel Lido.
There's heaven in every room.
Hotel Lido, that place nearby?
The receptionist is a friend... he won't charge a thing.
Get in.
You men are all the same.
How long have you been working in Lido?
Seven years.
Do you know Murugan?
Anand Murugan?
He was a receptionist there.
Why?
I'm looking for him.
But... no one seems to know where he is.
Everyone know he is dying in Melur...
aids is bad for business.
So, the manager sent him away.
Thank you.
That's it?
That's it.
Don't shoo me off... I can really help you.
I'll find you when I need you... now go.
Missing me already?
What's your name?
Rosie.
Good night, Rosie.
Where can I find Anand Murugan?
That way.
Anand Murugan?
Sir, Devrath here.
- You were right, Murugan has aids.
- About a year ago he got a bag from Armaan Kapoor's accountant.
- For a guy called Shashi.
Now who's Shashi?
He's a pimp.
He works out of Hotel Lido.
Shashi gave Murugan Rs. 2000 for the bag.
I hope Murugan isn't lying.
I don't think so.
He is dying, why would he lie?
- Where is Shashi?
- He told me he was going to Sangli for some work.
What work?
That he didn't tell me.
When is he expected?
I don't know.
Listen to me...
Shashi is in trouble.
If you want to help him, tell me where he is.
Sir, I really don't know.
Did Shashi ever mention anything about Armaan Kapoor?
- Where is Shashi?
- l don't know.
- Haven't seen him around.
I heard he went back to his village.
Where is that?
You know, a place that has cows and bullock carts.
A village.
You're quite a good comedienne.
But, unfortunately for you... it's not easy to make me laugh.
You have two options.
Either you give us Shashi's address... or we can take a drive to the station.
Hold on.
You can't just arrest me.
Devrath, she really is funny... she's made me smile too.
Christina, get me my diary.
- Sir, Shashi didn't come here to Sangli.
Just as I thought.
You can come back.
Tell the cops there to keep an eye on his family.
We have to find this guy no matter what!
I need these pills.
Karan liked to play in water.
Ever since he was little.
When I'd get the water ready for his bath... he'd be so happy.
He would fill his mouth and spout water on me.
He wouldn't stop laughing!
Karan loved to be in water... did he have to drown and die?
Losing a child is a very traumatic experience.
I empathise with you... but life does take unexpected turns.
Sometimes we end up losing people that we love.
But we have to carry on.
Be patient, Roshni.
I can assure you that with the help of these sessions and medication... you will get out of this.
And you have your husband for support as well...
Along with Karan... I also lost Suri.
The fact is Suri needs your help more than I do.
I don't know what he thinks... or what he feels.
He doesn't talk to me.
You know... he never talks about Karan.
Never.
Do you feel Suri doesn't care?
No, he does care.
If he didn't... he'd be able to sleep.
My sadness is met with a silence from you
Time is to blame and that is the truth
Beat after beat a sorrow continues to stay
Then why does the heart still seem to say
Live a little
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Yes this life has been full of pain
But there is a solace too that it contains I am yours and you are mine
And we hope that this won't ever change
Then why has the road that leads me to you broken down
Why are we meeting life with a frown
Come let's open the doors, let it all go
Let's cry our hearts out, let the tears flow
Live a little
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Let the pain clouds drift away
Allow life to blossom a little each day
Leave the past where it belongs
And listen to what the heart has to say
Live a little
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
- Sir, the guy in the yellow t-shirt is Tehmur, Shashi's confidant.
- He's walking towards you.
Alright.
Tehmur!
Me... sir?
You are Tehmur, right?
What do you do?
I'm a beggar.
I'm very poor...
don't even have enough to eat.
Sir, I haven't done anything...
- Sir, where are you taking me?
- Get him in!
- Speak up!
He's not talking.
Sir, I really don't know where Shashi is...
Sir, I swear I don't know anything.
Shut up!
Sir is an encounter specialist.
A few days ago he shot dead some goons!
You better talk.
Sir, trust me, I really don't know anything.
What will you do if Shashi calls you?
I'll inform you.
What if you don't?
You can chop off my legs!
You can go.
Really?
Now get lost!
Shashi has never treated you well.
He treats you like a dog!
I suggest you come clean to Inspector Shekhawat.
And save yourself.
Pande, you know me well.
I'm not trying to help Shashi... nor am I being a hero.
I want to stay away from it all.
Shashi is into something big.
Shashi took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
He can't escape... sooner or later we will get him.
We're sorry.
The number you've reached is not in service.
Tehmur, give us some water.
- Shashi, You better listen to me.
- Stop calling me so many times.
- l told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
- Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
- lf you want the money, don't call again.
Seen Shashi around?
No, sir... I knew you would be back.
Why?
Everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
You were right about Murugan.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Because cops don't really help the people here.
Cops treat everyone alike.
You're really funny, you know that?
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
That's not why I'm here.
Then, why are you here?
Don't lie to me.
I can sense you are lonely.
No fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I am not here to play games.
Do you know Shashi?
Shashi?
What's there to know?
He is a jerk.
Do you work for him?
I am one of his top girls.
Where is he right now?
I don't know.
I'm looking for him... will you help me?
Get your team to fill in for me... and I'll step in for them... as a cop.
If you want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms... but how long can he stay submerged... sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Shashi is playing a big game this time... it involves millions.
So, tell the cops... to arrest him and chop his balls off!
No, it's time for my payback... I've done enough dirty work for him.
Shashi won't do anything for you.
He better.
He owes me.
I want to ask you something.
I need you to be sober when I say this... I need to be drunk to do my job.
Ask me...
Nirmala... lf l hit the big time... and make lots of money... will you marry me?
Did the cops hit you on your head?
Come on, answer me... will you come with me?
Stop building these castles in the air.
I'm a whore and I'll always be one... and you'll always be a whore's lame son!
Stay away from Shashi's rackets if you want to stay alive...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
Karan... wait... don't go...
Dada...
Let's play checkers instead.
Alright!
Who wants red?
- l...
- l!
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
- Okay.
Karan... wait... I'll come with you.
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I need your help.
Can you call my mom and dad?
I want to talk to them... their names are Roshni and Surjan.
Please tell them, I want to talk to them.
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I want to talk to my mom and dad...
Concentrate, my dear.
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
Hello mom... I'm right here with you... I'm happy that I'm speaking with you.
Thank you, mom.
Please tell dad that... I really want to talk to him... I know you and dad are sad because of me.
I am always with you...
Please don't cry, mom.
I want to see you smiling like this always.
I can sense you are lonely... no fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I knew you would be back... everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
I am not here to play games.
Then, why are you here?
Do you know Shashi?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms...
- What is it?
Some creep tied stones to a girl's body and threw it in the sea.
But how long can he stay submerged...
- The body did not surface for four days.
Sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Have you sent it for post-mortem?
No, sir, we're trying to get identification.
- What did you just say?
- Sir!
A girl's body has surfaced in Mahim Creek... the killer tied stones to her body before drowning her.
She was killed four days ago.
Devrath!
Send Shashi's photo and description to all morgues and hospitals... immediately!
- Last evening at approximately 8:30...
- a clean shot through the head...
- the killer was at a distance of almost 300 metres.
- The shell casing and gunshot wound prove that a .315 calibre rifle was used.
- Definitely a professional hit.
- We got these keys from his pocket, of a room at the Golden Eyes hotel.
We recovered these things from his room... he had checked in as Krishna Nair.
He didn't have anything apart from his clothes... nothing to identify him.
Why is this so heavy?
When your time comes... there's nothing you can do about it.
What's with the long faces, guys?
Shashi bhai is dead.
What?
!
What rubbish?
It's true, he is dead.
Someone shot him last evening at the Mahim carnival.
But what was Shashi doing at the carnival anyway?
Shashi, you better listen to me... stop calling me over and over again.
I told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Shashi is into something big... he took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
Did Shashi have a green bag?
Did he?
I don't want to go back to that life...
Sorry, Mallika.
Madam is calling you.
Shashi paid her for me...
Move it.
- Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- tell them Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- Tehmur!
Armaan Kapoor?
Shashi bhai...
Come in, doctor... the bleeding hasn't stopped.
- Shashi, she needs to be taken to a hospital...
- No, no hospital...
fix her up here... lf you ever say a word about this... I will break your face.
Get it?
Shashi bhai, thanks for the payback.
We had to report to the income-tax department because the 2 million was in cash.
You'll have to apply for a refund.
How did Armaan know...
that guy Shashi?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
Why was he blackmailing Armaan?
Sonya, he said he doesn't know.
You think it's possible that...
Armaan was using prostitutes?
Sonya, please... I want to know the truth.
I'm not really sure... but, yes it's possible.
Hello?
I'm Shashi's friend.
Excuse me.
Who is this?
- l just told you!
Remember Shashi?
You called him to the carnival... and you killed him.
I'm in a meeting right now... let me call you back in some time.
Please, don't bother... I'll call you back in an hour... you better answer or you will regret it.
Okay.
He's taken the bait!
Jackpot!
Who would have thought you were so smart, Tehmur?
Tell me... I want five million.
What?
What for?
To keep your secret safe.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, don't waste my time.
Okay then, you'll hear from the cops... once they get Shashi's phone sim and the DVD.
- lf that's not good enough... I know about the girl too.
I'm in trouble, dad.
It's a real mess.
What is it?
Armaan and I... some people have been blackmailing us.
What?
Who are these people?
Do you remember Nikhil's accident?
Of course.
He didn't fall from the balcony of our Juhu bungalow... I lied to you.
Actually, he fell off a moving car... it was an accident, dad.
How come you're home so early!
Are you complaining?
Suri!
Do you have to go back?
No.
Then let's go out.
Where?
Let's go for a movie... and then we'll eat out...
Please, Suri... come on...
Please!
I couldn't stop laughing!
How did you like the film?
I was watching you, actually... it's good to see you happy.
Thank you, Roshni...
For seeing the therapist... I know it can't be easy for you... but I think it's really helping you.
- Hi Roshni aunty...
- Samar!
What brings you to Mumbai?
My cousin is getting married next week... I was going to call you...
Samar's been looking forward to seeing you.
If you're free one evening, come over... have dinner with us.
Sure, why not!
How about Friday?
I'm working late on Friday.
What about Saturday?
Actually, I'm busy all week... I'm working on a new case, sorry, I'm really pressed for time.
No problem... you cops do work long hours.
I can't believe you did that!
They must have felt so bad... they are our friends, Suri.
That doesn't mean I have to meet them... I'm not stopping you from meeting them.
Every time I look at Samar...
He is only a child, Suri... what happened wasn't his fault.
I know... the fault was mine.
It was an accident, Suri.
No, it was negligence... on my part.
Instead of keeping an eye on them, I fell asleep.
So did I... we didn't know the kids would do something like that.
Please, Suri.
Don't blame yourself.
You can say what you want now, Roshni... but I know how you look at me sometimes...
But... I've never blamed you... I've never thought like this...
But I do... every single day.
Don't... you mustn't blame yourself... come on... let's go in and talk.
No, I've got some work.
Please, Suri.
Suri...
This illness you have of the heart
I don't seem to understand at all
You abandon everything that's near and dear
And what remains distant you seem to call
My heart is listless!
Without you.
My heart is listless!
Without you.
I don't know why
And I don't know how
There exists an invisible tension
One that tugs
One that leads
One that tugs One that leads
Me in your direction I am the mystery I am that story
That doesn't have an end
Come closer and you shall see
Come closer and you shall see
The distance remains and is meant to be
My heart is listless!
Without you.
My heart is listless!
Without you.
What I haven't been able to unravel ls the riddle that you are
No one knows the secret
No one knows the secret
The secret who's friend you are I smile, and hide from the world
How restless I am day and night lt's been a while since I shut my eyes lt's been a while since I shut my eyes
Been a while since I felt peace inside
My heart is listless!
Without you.
My heart is listless!
Without you.
Don't you ever go home?
And when do you sleep?
Hmm?
I need to ask you something... I'll come back later if you are busy.
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
How does it matter?
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here... lsn't it peaceful here?
Why are you so sad?
What makes you say that?
Fine, you don't have to talk about it.
Let's talk about something else... how's the investigation going?
I heard Shashi was killed.
I don't know what I am looking for.
Every clue seems to lead to a blank... I feel like the answers are staring me in the face... but I can't see them.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Did Shashi ever make you meet... anyone famous?
Meet anyone famous?
You want to know if I slept with Armaan Kapoor?
Then ask me straight... I won't be offended... it's my job.
The answer is no... but his friend was a regular client.
And I met Armaan once with him.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
You never asked me.
When was this?
Three years ago...
Armaan wasn't as famous back then...
He came with Nikhil, his friend.
There was another guy with them.
We went for a drive...
That's all.
This other guy... was his name Sanjay Kejriwal?
I don't know his name... but I'd recognise him if I saw him.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
If you want to get out... I can help you.
I know.
But not yet... there are some things I need to take care of... let me get done with that.
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
I have to say... you're really different.
Trust me, you don't belong here either.
How's that?
Well, you actually care about people... without wanting anything in return.
Not too many people like that around here.
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
No one's heard of her since... no one knows if she is dead or alive... and no one cares.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
Did you report it to the cops?
Are you crazy?
I think I should remind you about the laws in our country.
Prostitution is still illegal.
We don't even exist... and if we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Hello, I'm Inspector Shekhawat... and I'm here to see Nikhil Deshpande.
He wants to meet Nikhil.
Nikhil... look, someone's come to see you.
Doctors are not sure how much he can understand...
He understands everything, I know it.
- He hasn't spoken since the accident.
The profits recorded went up by 8 percent... and, this trend indicates that... there is a substantial growth in this sector.
And, according to--
Hello?
hold on for a second...
Guys...
I have to take this call so... please continue...
Okay, as I was saying... according to this trend... I want to meet with you.
You got the money?
Are you listening to me?
I want to meet--
You think I'm an idiot?
I know what happened to Shashi.
I didn't kill Shashi.
I was at the carnival with the money... waiting for Shashi.
I've been paying him off for years, why would I have him killed?
I can ruin you in a matter of hours...
What will you get out of it?
Think about it...
- lf you're ready to meet, I will bring the money... at a place and time of your choice.
Why are the lights switched off...
Come...
Devrath, come in...
This way, Devrath...
Nice house, sir.
Roshni...
Looks like my wife is out...
Would you like a drink?
I don't mind...
Whisky, right?
Yes, sir.
Soda or water?
Water, sir...
And ice?
Okay.
Sorry, Devrath... I think Roshni forgot that you were coming over for dinner... she's out for a film with a friend.
It's okay, sir.
Hello Suri, how're you doing?
Sorry to disturb your film, but I need to speak with Roshni...
- l can't get through her phone.
What film?
- Roshni's not with me, Suri.
- ls everything okay?
Yeah...
I'm sorry...
I got it wrong... it slipped my mind, sorry...
Devrath, do you know where Billimoria lives?
Sir... block-2, ground floor...
What's wrong, sir?
Sir...
Where is Roshni?
She's inside...
you have to wait here.
You can't go in there...
Sir... you can't...
Suri... I warned you to stay away... didn't I?
Suri...
Suri... stop it...
Have you lost it, Roshni?
What are you doing here?
Karan is dead, he can't talk to you.
I don't blame you for your anger, it comes from the pain within--
That's enough!
If you can really talk to Karan, tell him to appear now... I want to see him...
where is he?
I can't do that.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form... but Karan didn't have a problem moving to the afterlife... he had a smooth passage.
Unbelievable!
A smooth passage?
He was only 8 and he drowned to death!
How smooth is that?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
I didn't choose this life... it chose me.
- Let's go...
- No, Surjan... listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
When my husband died, I was very depressed... and that's when the spirits started communicating with me.
Let's go!
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
- Stop it, Suri, let go of me!
Stop it!
Suri!
How could you lie to me?
You hid all this from me?
How can I tell you the truth?
You are never home.
Don't change the subject.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
You're highly educated...
you taught science to kids... think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
I don't know what I believe... but I know she has told me things... that only Karan knew about.
It makes me happy... why don't you understand?
Suri...
Karan wants to talk to you!
You've lost it completely, Roshni.
You need help.
I don't need help... I need to talk to you...
Can you talk to me?
Can you stay home one night with me?
Can we live like a couple and not like strangers?
I'll see you later, sir.
Hold on!
You work with him, right?
Are you also out every night?
is your wife okay that you never come home?
Where do you go, Suri?
Have I ever asked you?
Who are you with every night?
I know you are not working... I know you are with someone.
I don't know where you go or what you do... but it keeps you going... it makes you happy.
So why can't I do something that gives me peace and happiness?
See you later, sir.
All couples go through phases...
Suri and you have been through hell... give it time...
this too shall pass.
I don't think so.
Have you thought about having another child?
Suri would not hear of it.
I tried bringing it up but... he didn't want to talk about it.
I think he is having an affair.
What?
No way... that's impossible...
Roshni, we're talking about Suri.
I asked him straight out... he didn't even deny it.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Are you falling for me, officer?
I'm kidding!
What do you want to ask me?
Are you... are you okay?
I am very tired...
Come with me... come on...
Please don't misunderstand... I just want to talk.
If someone says that to me... I suppose, I should be offended.
Come here... I won't bite.
This is my wife, Roshni... and this is Karan... my son.
Your wife is very beautiful.
Roshni and I were very happy...
What happened then?
Karan... ls anyone really happy?
Are you happy?
I have my moments.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Try me...
Some other time perhaps...
Can you do me a favour, please?
What?
Remember Mallika?
Shashi's girlfriend?
Yeah...
She is in a mess... can you help her?
What happened to her?
Close your eyes...
Hey you... get Mallika.
Okay, sir.
Where's Mallika?
For today I'm Mallika... what do you want?
Police business, get her.
She's out.
Call her out or I'll come back with a warrant... and that will be the end of you.
Who did this to you?
Shashi paid her off for me... now she denies it... and is forcing me back to work.
If you want to get out of here, sit in the car.
They won't let me leave...
Don't worry about them...
get in the car.
Trust me... don't be scared.
Where do you think you're going?
Go stop her!
Come back here...
Let me file these papers.
She is a good woman.
She will help you.
Sir... thank you.
Don't thank me, thank Rosie... she told me about you.
Rosie?
Who's she?
She is one of Madam's girls.
I don't know who you're talking about...
That's how it is with us girls...
today Rosie, tomorrow Jasmine.
That's how we play it.
Sir... I...
lied to you earlier.
Shashi knew Armaan Kapoor.
Shashi met Armaan Kapoor... on the night of his accident.
Do you know why?
I never meddled in his work.
But, you know what... you should get hold of that slime Tehmur... I'm sure he knows something.
After everything Shashi did for him...
Tehmur... help me...
- The creep didn't raise a finger to help me.
Tehmur, don't do this...
Shashi was like a brother to you.
- He was trying to steal Shashi's stuff.
What stuff?
It was a green bag... which Shashi had got home that night.
Tomorrow morning at 11:15 at Churchgate station, come alone.
- Bring the money with you... I'll call you with more instructions...
One more thing...
- if I meet with Shashi's fate... whether you're responsible for it or not, the cops will get the stuff.
Fine.
I've to work...
what is it?
I need your help...
My help?
I can't trust anyone but you.
Hold it!
I don't want to get into any mess.
Nirmala... lf this plan works out... you and I can get out of here.
Free as birds... think about it.
I don't know who is the bigger fool... you or I...
Tehmur!
Hello?
Listen carefully... there is a restroom to your right... you'll see a blue bag under the basin, dump the money into it.
- Get it?
Yeah...
- Then head to platform number 4... the train for Virar leaves in 5 minutes...
- get into the compartment next to the first class.
Hurry up, you don't want to miss the train.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Hi darling!
That's a... nice bag...
Who you are working for?
Tell me... I'll make it worth your while.
I can give you a lot more.
Listen!
You're making a mistake.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Where there is happiness ln its shadow I reside
And those who smile
Also have a tear in their eye
Wherever you go
Beneath you the same ground will lie
And above you the same sky I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
I need your help... I can't trust anyone but you.
I don't know who's the bigger fool...
you or I...
Listen...
You have to pretend... not to know me.
Don't talk to me... in fact, don't even look at me.
Corner him!
Catch him!
Where's the money, you jerk!
This guy is operating on his own...
- he confessed everything...
- he worked For Shashi... and happened to stumble upon this...
- he doesn't even know your name...
- he got your number from Shashi's sim card.
Finish him off...
- You will get the rest of your money... and don't call me ever again.
Did you ever think of me?
Did you... even once?
I haven't done anything...
You claimed to be my friend... I did nothing...
Over there...
they pushed him... I will join you on the train.
But if I don't get there... don't wait for me.
Get on the train, come what may.
You've got to be on that train, okay?
!
Simran...
- He said Simran...
- Simran?
Yes, sir, he said Simran... and died.
Sir, the hospital called... that goon is conscious... we can take his statement, should I go?
No, I'll go.
Now listen... you and Rane go to the brothel.
Apparently Tehmur mentioned a 'Simran' before he died...
Find out who this girl is that Tehmur knew... probably one of Madam's girls, bring her in.
It's in your best interest to cooperate with me... or else, the lockup is where you'll be.
Sir is talking to you...
Sir!
the patient is still critical.
- Leave the room...
- But, sir...
Let me do my job.
Get out!
Out!
No one can help you now!
If you are lucky enough to survive... here's what will happen.
I'll take you into my custody and question you... and I have a way of getting the truth.
Then I'll file a case against you... for Tehmur's murder... and I'll make sure you get the death penalty for killing him.
I guarantee you that.
Tehmur was a key police witness... and you were caught red-handed.
Think about it... if you cooperate... I'll save you from the death penalty.
Tell me, who hired you to clear their mess?
Ghorpade, take him into our custody.
I think he prefers to be there.
Sir... the doctor said he can't be discharged...
Tell the doctor he didn't say anything like that.
I want this man in my custody today.
Do whatever it takes.
Yes, sir.
Gokhale... get started... remove these pipes and tubes...
Sanjay Kejriwal!
What?
Sanjay Kejriwal.
Sir, there's no Simran here.
No, sir... a few girls said there was someone called Simran... but she ran away some years ago.
Where could she have gone?
Someone has to know... it's possible that she is still there... and the other girls are trying to protect her.
Tell Rane to stay there and keep looking.
Okay, sir.
- You go to the police station... and meet me at Sanjay Kejriwal's bungalow with a team.
Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
This way, sir.
Inspector Shekhawat!
What brings you here?
Mr. Kejriwal, I have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
On what basis?
For getting Tehmur and Shashi murdered.
Babu Tipnis... you know him already...
He has signed an affidavit implicating you... you have to come with us.
Hand over your mobile phone, please.
Now!
Let's go.
Come on, stand up.
- l said stand up!
- Please... just a minute.
Can we talk?
Go ahead.
In private?
I'm afraid not.
He was blackmailing us... lt all started three years ago.
Armaan, me and our friend, Nikhil...
- were out one night.
I know what we can take to the bachelor party...
Nikhil knew Shashi...
- go to Hotel Lido...
Hello Shashi...
- We went with him to Hotel Lido...
- and there we picked up a girl.
I wasn't happy about it.
What was the girl's name?
Simran.
Nikhil started messing with the girl in the car...
How about a trial...
- What happened next?
I don't know...
- probably the back door wasn't locked properly... lt was an accident!
Nikhil!
Shit!
Nikhil!
Be careful...
- Easy...
- Okay...
Armaan, get into the car now!
Sanjay, we can't leave her in this state...
Dude, you're asking for trouble... we'll get screwed because of this hooker.
Get in the car...
- Please!
- Sanjay?
- Sanjay, we can't leave her here...
what if she dies...
Call that guy, Shashi...
Call Shashi, he will handle it...
Oh God!
Shashi called Armaan a week later... and sent him a DVD... it had footage from the security camera at Hotel Lido... of the three of us leaving the lobby with the girl.
Shashi told us the girl was dead... and he had buried her body somewhere.
Where's the DVD?
I know her, she's the one who has been helping me.
You mean, she is... alive?
Yes, Mr. Kejriwal, I've met her several times... I think Shashi and the girl conned you.
But sir, if that's the case, why would she help you?
Only she can answer that.
Devrath, head to Hotel Lido right now... she might be there... she goes by the name of Rosie nowadays, not Simran... and inform Rane as well.
Get her to the police station immediately.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
If you had informed the police right at the beginning... it would've saved many lives... probably your friend, Armaan's too.
So much happened...
and all for what?
Look out!
- Sir...
- l think only I can see her...
Have you lost your mind, Shekhawat?
Next thing you'll tell me...
is that you saw a ghost!
Don't misunderstand me... I and the police department value you tremendously... but there's talk going on about you that could ruin your career.
Your subordinates have been saying that you don't sleep at night... keep driving all night... you talk to yourself...
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Think about your future, Shekhawat... if you mention this in your official report... you know what's going to happen... you'll be the laughing stock of the department.
I think... you should take a break for two months... you really need it.
But what about the truth?
The truth is that...
Sanjay Kejriwal decided to end his life instead of going to jail.
Armaan Kapoor died in an accident that can only be an act of providence.
And the two men blackmailing them... they're dead.
Case closed!
This is the truth and this will go as your official statement.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
No, Surjan, listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
I can take your pain away.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
If you want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I knew you would be back.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form.
If we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here...
Why don't you understand, Suri?
Karan wants to talk to you!
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
Hello dad, I miss you... I know you miss me a lot too...
What happened that day was not your fault... it was my fault, dad... I am sorry.
There was nothing you could have done to change it... this is what I had to tell you...
Please don't blame yourself... because that makes me very sad.
Please don't fight with mom because of me.
I can never be happy if both of you are so unhappy.
Dad, do you remember telling me... that you always wanted to see me happy?
I know I can count on you to make everything okay... because you are the best dad in the world.
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here ln my every thought
Every word spoken ln my every feeling
My every emotion
There is only you
You are everywhere
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
You never really left my side
You hold my hand even today
No matter what the destination is
You will be my fellow traveller
All the way
The world may say you are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say you are gone
But you are here
You are right here

Thank you
Sonia, we still do not know where your husband when on that night or what was he doing on that road and accident?
And we also can't understand why his car turn and fall into the ocean
Madam Sonia, forgive me for asking
Yes
Was there any thing bothering him?
I meant was he having probleams
Armaan did not kill himself Inspector!
Why will he kill himself?
You guys cant solve the case is it?
Today morning, my accountant told me on that day he past Armaan Rs20 lakh cash
Why?
I gave him the cash at 7.30 why didn't you tell Sonia about this?
Sir, I tried to tell her but she was in a shock, that's why i could not talk to her
what kind of notes was it?
In thousands, it was a green colour PUMA beg
We did not find such beg
That night you pecked his stuff right?
Tell me!
There were music system, lunch box and a beg which was given by the accountant
Red colour right?
No sir, it was green in colour
What was in that beg?
Did you open and see it?
No sir, i will never open his beg without his permission
Really?
Really sir
Did Mr Kapoor tell anything about the beg?
No sir have he done this before?
Yes, 2 times 1 year back Mr Armaan did ask me to deliver Rs 10 lakh to hotel Lido... which is on the same road where his death tragic happen.
Why?
I do not know sir, I was just told to past it to the receptionist.
You had a worker by the name of Anand Murugen
Murugen... for 4 years he was you hotel receptionist
but he has resign and after that we did not hear any news
Its extotion case if it's extotion im sure he would have talk to somebody even his wife or any of his close friend do not knows anything got blackmail any relevance to his death
By right it should not there are many evidence whithout the right answer.
And today his wife filed F.I. R
This was the only thing left for her to do... get all my police force to investigate for this Hero's case
So find him faster
Sir, Shashi speeking what you want calling me so many times?
Had to change my phone number sir there is a probleam going on

I wont get offended this is my job
i have never gone out with him but one of his friend was my customer
and there was once Armaan Kapoor come with him
Why you did not tell me this?
You never ask when did you meet him?
3 years back at that time he was not famous

can I ask you a question?
Ask me
Did Shashi introduced you with any rich guy?
Rich guy you meant Armaan Kapoor
why dont you ask me straight away sir?
I wont get offended this is my job
i have never gone out with him but one of his friend was my customer
and there was once Armaan Kapoor come with him
Why you did not tell me this?
You never ask when did you meet him?
3 years back at that time he was not famous
Nikhal also brought one of his other friend there was another man with him
we when for a drive that's all
the third man was his name Sanjay Gigriwal?
I do not know his name but once i look at him I will be able to identify
why are you in this kind of life Rozy?
This place does not suit you
I was waiting for you will you come here?
And take me away from here
If you want to be out just tell me

I still have some debts to pay can i clear it first?
What else sir maybe one day i can be help for you
I have to believe this sir you are not same like the other guys from my judgement your place belongs some way else

You know, you care for others and dont even take advantage of others
3 years back one of my friend when out with some guys and she did not return
nobody knows where she when is she still alive or dead
no one cares something to think about right sir?
A girl goes missing any no one even bother asking did you do a police report?

It's only the night that brings the forbidden to life
The streets open their arms to whoever passes by
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Yesterday in these very lanes, in these crushed flowers
There was such a high
Now only thirsty spirits, wracked in agony
Seem to wander by
All searching for the same thing
Not knowing the futility it will bring
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Between the lights and among the shadows
An unhappy secret exists
Why is it here?
What has happened for such anger to persist
Tell me oh dark night
Nothing escapes your sight
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Good morning, sir.
Devrath Kulkarni.
So what happened here?
An accident, sir.
The car crashed into the sea.
I've heard a lot about you... it's an honour to work with you.
The car came speeding down the road... and then it swerved... like...
like this... straight into the sea.
Where were you?
I was sitting over there.
Sir...
Pinky knew something was about to happen.
She warned us... but we ignored her.
Who is Pinky?
- Another witness.
- Hello, sir.
That was the only car on the road.
Anything else on the road?
There was absolutely nothing on the road... I saw it...
Sir, please come here.
- Get a stretcher.
That's Armaan Kapoor.
Check if there's any id.
The doors were locked... he was also wearing the seatbelt.
It is him.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
Move away... all of you.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Here.
What happened to Ramu, our driver?
is he...
Mr. Kapoor was driving... he was alone.
Alone?
What about Yuvraj?
His spotboy... he accompanies Armaan everywhere.
There was no one else in the car.
But, Armaan...
Armaan was never on his own.
I don't get it... why was he driving?
He hates driving.
Get Ramu and Yuvraj's number... talk to them.
Good morning, mom.
What's wrong, mom?
- Film star Armaan Kapoor met with an accident... last night on Seaface road.
He died in the crash.
- Seaface road is part of Mumbai's underbelly... famous for the red light area nearby.
It is not clear what Armaan Kapoor...
- was doing here last night.
- Meanwhile Sonya Kapoor's brother, Teji Singh has stated that...
- the family is not satisfied with the police statement...
- that it was merely an accident.
Right now, we need time to deal with this tragedy...
- only then can we take any legal recourse.
- We still don't know what really happened.
What's wrong, Juhi?
Lost your husband?
Bhai...
Bhai...
Armaan Kapoor is dead.
What?
Armaan Kapoor, the actor... here on Seaface road.
Are you serious?
That's where l'm coming from... it's chaos down there.
The press is all over questioning the junkies.
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Whom did you meet?
Shut up!
You have only one good leg... how about I break that too?
Jinxed bastard...
always arrives with bad news.
Here, get us breakfast.
Move it!
Poor guy, you are so mean to him.
Never repeat what I say to you... in front of others.
Get it?
Sorry.
I said, I'm sorry!
- Sir, is the underworld involved in Armaan Kapoor's death?
- That's all the information we have right now.
I'm here outside Armaan Kapoor's place... he lived in an apartment on the top floor.
People have been pouring in to offer their condolences...
Where is Sonya?
She's upstairs.
Come in Devrath.
Sit.
Tell me.
Armaan Kapoor was shooting at Filmcity on the night of 4th March... for producer Deepak Lalwani's film... they were shooting on floor number 4.
They wrapped the shoot at around 2 AM.
- Pack up!
Good shot, Armaan.
- Both his driver and spotboy were with him at that time.
- Did you talk to them?
- Yes, sir.
- They said Armaan took 15 minutes to change.
- His staff went about routinely packing his things.
But, then something unusual happened.
- Armaan sent them both home from the studio...
- and he drove himself.
- Ramu... you go home, I'll drive myself.
- Come on...
- They also thought it was odd because Armaan didn't like to drive.
When did he leave from Filmcity?
At 2:20 AM.
The accident occurred at 4 AM.
How long does it take to get to Seaface road from Filmcity?
Probably 30 minutes, at night.
Even if you give it 45 minutes... where was he for an hour before the accident?
We don't know that yet, sir.
And Seaface road where the accident occurred... is not on his way home.
Inspector Shekhawat...
- Sir, I'm calling from The Times of India to confirm a story.
- Sources tell us that there's an unidentified number on Armaan Kapoor's mobile.
- ls it true that his last call--
His phone was destroyed by the water, it's in the workshop.
Who speaks to the press here?
Come on guys, who here knows journalists... you know, to help me leak a story?
Sir!
Devrath, confiscate their mobiles.
Your phones.
Quick!
This is a high profile case.
No talking to the media.
The autopsy and forensics details... any evidence we get... none of it is to be made public... until this case is solved.
is that clear?
I said, no talking to the media... you can talk to me.
Alright, back to work.
Sir!
I'm Rakesh Rane.
Yes, Rane?
I don't think this case will ever be solved... it's an A-final case, sir.
I mean... there have been similar accidents on that road in the past few years.
All freak accidents... put down as acts of providence... all unexplained.
We didn't get any evidence, whatsoever.
Finally one mystery is cleared... I know why so many officers transfer out of this station.
How's it going?
What's up?
Madamji.
Shashi bhai, where did you flick...
I mean buy the belt from?
You again!
Where you off to, Nirmala?
My clients want young girls... not old hags.
The rest of you...
let's go.
- Today's clients have flown in from Goa.
Don't listen to him.
You look really nice... I know.
What's the matter, Shashi?
You look tense...
something bothering you?
- Hey!
- Open up!
Shashi...
What were you doing?
Nothing... just trying to rile you up.
Look at you... guess I managed to!
- Shashi bhai, it's me...
Tehmur.
Here's the new sim card, Shashi bhai.
Take that in.
You changing your number?
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
I'm off to my village for a few days.
That's your answer if anyone asks.
Now get lost!
- Take me with you.
- lt's a work-trip...
- not a vacation.
Once it's done, I'll rush back to you.
But until then...
No one must know anything.
- But what was Armaan doing on Seaface road?
Suri, stop being secretive... give us the scoop.
It was an accident.
That's it.
Pass the water, please.
You actually met Sonya Kapoor?
- ls she as beautiful in real life?
- lt is so sad.
He was so young... no?
- He shouldn't have died.
Young people die all the time... but frankly no one--
Sorry.
Don't be silly... you don't need to apologise to us.
How's she doing now?
She's better.
I've spoken to a psychiatrist...
Anjali Punjabi.
Yes, she is quite good.
Yeah, I think it will help Roshni--
Can I get you something?
No, thanks.
Go back.
Stop.
The car was in perfect condition.
- The power brakes were working fine.
He braked here and then swerved... and crashed through those steps into the sea.
Seems like he was trying to avoid hitting something... but there was nothing on the road.
He wasn't drunk either.
Yes, sir.
The reports don't show any traces of alcohol or narcotics.
His lungs were filled with water.
- Cause of death is drowning.
- Sir... it seems like one of those A-final cases...
- none of it makes any sense.
Come on.
- Thousands have gathered on the streets to pay their last respects...
- to beloved Bollywood actor Armaan Kapoor...
- Yes?
- Hello.
I'm Frenny Mistry... I live in the neighbourhood... thought I'd welcome you.
There was no need for this...
Darling, everybody needs cheese cake!
You need any help?
Oh no... I'm fine... just some boxes left to unpack.
Call me if you need anything... I have a number for everything.
Carpenter, electrician, plumber, anything you need... I know them all!
Thank you.
I would love some tea.
Of course, please sit.
So, you're alone at home all day... while your husband is out chasing robbers?
How long have you been married?
12 years.
- Milk and sugar?
Yes, dear...
- two spoons.
Hello, Karan.
Hello, Inspector.
Hello.
This is Sanjay...
Armaan's best friend.
Hello.
- Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Sonyaji, we still don't know where your husband was heading that night... or why he was on that road.
And the accident?
It's still a mystery why he steered the car off the road... and crashed into the sea.
Sonyaji... may I ask you something?
Sure.
Was something bothering Mr. Kapoor?
I mean, was he depressed or disturbed?
Armaan did not kill himself, Inspector.
- Why would he kill himself?
Because you can't figure out what really happened?
Just this morning my accountant told me... he had given Armaan 2 million rupees in cash that day.
Why?
We don't know.
- l gave him the money... at around 7:30 in the evening.
- Why didn't you inform Sonyaji about this before?
Sir, I did try... but she was in a state of shock, so I couldn't speak to her.
- Was the money in 500 rupee bills?
No, sir, 1000 rupee bills.
The money was in a green Puma bag.
But we didn't get any such bag in the car.
- Didn't you pack Armaan's stuff that night?
What all was there?
His gym bag... music system, lunch box... and... a bag that the accountant gave him.
A red bag?
No, sir, a green one.
What was in it?
Did you open it?
No, sir, I never open his bags unless he asked me to.
Sure?
Yes, sir.
Did Mr. Kapoor tell you who the bag was for?
No.
Has this ever happened before?
Twice.
And once... about a year ago, on Mr. Kapoor's instructions... I personally dropped off 1 million rupees at Hotel Lido.
It's quite close to where...
the accident took place.
Why?
I don't know, sir.
I was instructed to... give the bag to the receptionist.
- Hello, sir.
What's the problem?
Anand Murugan used to work here, I want to know his whereabouts.
Murugan?
He was a receptionist here for 4 years.
Of course!
He quit and...
we haven't heard from him.
- ls it extortion?
- Sir, blackmail seems more likely.
If it were extortion he would've told someone about it... but, neither his wife nor his friends know anything.
is the blackmail connected to his death?
I don't think so... but there are a lot of unanswered questions.
Today Armaan's wife has filed an fir.
That's all we need right now.
Do we use the entire police force to solve this hero's case?
Sir, I think once we get to Murugan we'll have a lot more answers.
- Then find him quickly.
- Sir.
- Sir...
Shashi here.
- Where the hell have you been?
- l have been trying desperately to call you.
I had to change my number... need to lie low.
- What happened with Armaan that night?
How should I know?
I wasn't there.
- Don't bullshit me.
- The police know about the 2 million!
You handle them... now back to business... I was promised 5 million... you owe me 3 more.
Why are kids made to dance to film songs?
is there nothing better to do?
The kids were good.
- Roshni...
- Roshni!
- Roshni!
Who is this lunatic?
- Hello dear.
- Hello.
This is my husband, Suri.
Hello...
This is Frenny, our neighbour.
She lives with her brother, Inspector Billimoria.
I've met your brother.
Poor you, dear.
Are you heading home?
Yes.
How are you, Surjan?
I'm fine, why?
Nothing... well...
Actually, I wanted to meet you.
For a while now.
Well... I have a message for you.
Message?
From whom?
From your son...
Karan.
He wants me to tell you that... ls this a joke?
No, please hear me out...
Karan wants me to tell you that he wants to talk to you.
Shut up!
Just shut up!
We don't want to hear anything.
Stay away from us.
Get it?
I mean it!
Let's go.
Karan said...
'Tell Dada I am fine'.
'Not to worry.'
'Tell Dada I want to talk to him.'
How does she know Karan called you Dada?
Didn't you say... she barged in and asked personal questions.
But... I didn't mention anything about Karan to her.
I can't believe the things people do for money.
But what if it's true?
What?
What if... she really did talk to Karan?
Karan is dead, Roshni.
He can't talk to anyone.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Don't believe in such stuff, Roshni.
That's nonsense.
Please don't do this to yourself and me.
Suri, all I am saying is...
can we hear her only once-- l'm sorry, I can't have this conversation.
It's too ridiculous, I'm leaving.
Suri, please... only once--
Suri!
Dada...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
- Karan, don't wander too far off.
- Okay.
- Karan!
- Karan!
Karan!
- Suri, find him.
Karan!
- Karan!
Looks like you need some love.
I can take your pain away.
Save it for someone else... I'm a cop.
I've always had shitty luck... I'm only getting started for the night and you call it a day!
But, it's okay, officer... take me with you.
Arrest me!
How will that help?
When you're already in hell.
Perhaps... but I know the way to heaven.
- Right down this road...
Hotel Lido.
There's heaven in every room.
Hotel Lido, that place nearby?
The receptionist is a friend... he won't charge a thing.
Get in.
You men are all the same.
How long have you been working in Lido?
Seven years.
Do you know Murugan?
Anand Murugan?
He was a receptionist there.
Why?
I'm looking for him.
But... no one seems to know where he is.
Everyone know he is dying in Melur...
aids is bad for business.
So, the manager sent him away.
Thank you.
That's it?
That's it.
Don't shoo me off... I can really help you.
I'll find you when I need you... now go.
Missing me already?
What's your name?
Rosie.
Good night, Rosie.
Where can I find Anand Murugan?
That way.
Anand Murugan?
Sir, Devrath here.
- You were right, Murugan has aids.
- About a year ago he got a bag from Armaan Kapoor's accountant.
- For a guy called Shashi.
Now who's Shashi?
He's a pimp.
He works out of Hotel Lido.
Shashi gave Murugan Rs. 2000 for the bag.
I hope Murugan isn't lying.
I don't think so.
He is dying, why would he lie?
- Where is Shashi?
- He told me he was going to Sangli for some work.
What work?
That he didn't tell me.
When is he expected?
I don't know.
Listen to me...
Shashi is in trouble.
If you want to help him, tell me where he is.
Sir, I really don't know.
Did Shashi ever mention anything about Armaan Kapoor?
- Where is Shashi?
- l don't know.
- Haven't seen him around.
I heard he went back to his village.
Where is that?
You know, a place that has cows and bullock carts.
A village.
You're quite a good comedienne.
But, unfortunately for you... it's not easy to make me laugh.
You have two options.
Either you give us Shashi's address... or we can take a drive to the station.
Hold on.
You can't just arrest me.
Devrath, she really is funny... she's made me smile too.
Christina, get me my diary.
- Sir, Shashi didn't come here to Sangli.
Just as I thought.
You can come back.
Tell the cops there to keep an eye on his family.
We have to find this guy no matter what!
I need these pills.
Karan liked to play in water.
Ever since he was little.
When I'd get the water ready for his bath... he'd be so happy.
He would fill his mouth and spout water on me.
He wouldn't stop laughing!
Karan loved to be in water... did he have to drown and die?
Losing a child is a very traumatic experience.
I empathise with you... but life does take unexpected turns.
Sometimes we end up losing people that we love.
But we have to carry on.
Be patient, Roshni.
I can assure you that with the help of these sessions and medication... you will get out of this.
And you have your husband for support as well...
Along with Karan... I also lost Suri.
The fact is Suri needs your help more than I do.
I don't know what he thinks... or what he feels.
He doesn't talk to me.
You know... he never talks about Karan.
Never.
Do you feel Suri doesn't care?
No, he does care.
If he didn't... he'd be able to sleep.
My sadness is met with a silence from you
Time is to blame and that is the truth
Beat after beat a sorrow continues to stay
Then why does the heart still seem to say
Live a little
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Yes this life has been full of pain
But there is a solace too that it contains I am yours and you are mine
And we hope that this won't ever change
Then why has the road that leads me to you broken down
Why are we meeting life with a frown
Come let's open the doors, let it all go
Let's cry our hearts out, let the tears flow
Live a little
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Let the pain clouds drift away
Allow life to blossom a little each day
Leave the past where it belongs
And listen to what the heart has to say
Live a little
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
- Sir, the guy in the yellow t-shirt is Tehmur, Shashi's confidant.
- He's walking towards you.
Alright.
Tehmur!
Me... sir?
You are Tehmur, right?
What do you do?
I'm a beggar.
I'm very poor...
don't even have enough to eat.
Sir, I haven't done anything...
- Sir, where are you taking me?
- Get him in!
- Speak up!
He's not talking.
Sir, I really don't know where Shashi is...
Sir, I swear I don't know anything.
Shut up!
Sir is an encounter specialist.
A few days ago he shot dead some goons!
You better talk.
Sir, trust me, I really don't know anything.
What will you do if Shashi calls you?
I'll inform you.
What if you don't?
You can chop off my legs!
You can go.
Really?
Now get lost!
Shashi has never treated you well.
He treats you like a dog!
I suggest you come clean to Inspector Shekhawat.
And save yourself.
Pande, you know me well.
I'm not trying to help Shashi... nor am I being a hero.
I want to stay away from it all.
Shashi is into something big.
Shashi took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
He can't escape... sooner or later we will get him.
We're sorry.
The number you've reached is not in service.
Tehmur, give us some water.
- Shashi, You better listen to me.
- Stop calling me so many times.
- l told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
- Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
- lf you want the money, don't call again.
Seen Shashi around?
No, sir... I knew you would be back.
Why?
Everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
You were right about Murugan.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Because cops don't really help the people here.
Cops treat everyone alike.
You're really funny, you know that?
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
That's not why I'm here.
Then, why are you here?
Don't lie to me.
I can sense you are lonely.
No fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I am not here to play games.
Do you know Shashi?
Shashi?
What's there to know?
He is a jerk.
Do you work for him?
I am one of his top girls.
Where is he right now?
I don't know.
I'm looking for him... will you help me?
Get your team to fill in for me... and I'll step in for them... as a cop.
If you want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms... but how long can he stay submerged... sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Shashi is playing a big game this time... it involves millions.
So, tell the cops... to arrest him and chop his balls off!
No, it's time for my payback... I've done enough dirty work for him.
Shashi won't do anything for you.
He better.
He owes me.
I want to ask you something.
I need you to be sober when I say this... I need to be drunk to do my job.
Ask me...
Nirmala... lf l hit the big time... and make lots of money... will you marry me?
Did the cops hit you on your head?
Come on, answer me... will you come with me?
Stop building these castles in the air.
I'm a whore and I'll always be one... and you'll always be a whore's lame son!
Stay away from Shashi's rackets if you want to stay alive...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
Karan... wait... don't go...
Dada...
Let's play checkers instead.
Alright!
Who wants red?
- l...
- l!
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
- Okay.
Karan... wait... I'll come with you.
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I need your help.
Can you call my mom and dad?
I want to talk to them... their names are Roshni and Surjan.
Please tell them, I want to talk to them.
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I want to talk to my mom and dad...
Concentrate, my dear.
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
Hello mom... I'm right here with you... I'm happy that I'm speaking with you.
Thank you, mom.
Please tell dad that... I really want to talk to him... I know you and dad are sad because of me.
I am always with you...
Please don't cry, mom.
I want to see you smiling like this always.
I can sense you are lonely... no fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I knew you would be back... everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
I am not here to play games.
Then, why are you here?
Do you know Shashi?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms...
- What is it?
Some creep tied stones to a girl's body and threw it in the sea.
But how long can he stay submerged...
- The body did not surface for four days.
Sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Have you sent it for post-mortem?
No, sir, we're trying to get identification.
- What did you just say?
- Sir!
A girl's body has surfaced in Mahim Creek... the killer tied stones to her body before drowning her.
She was killed four days ago.
Devrath!
Send Shashi's photo and description to all morgues and hospitals... immediately!
- Last evening at approximately 8:30...
- a clean shot through the head...
- the killer was at a distance of almost 300 metres.
- The shell casing and gunshot wound prove that a .315 calibre rifle was used.
- Definitely a professional hit.
- We got these keys from his pocket, of a room at the Golden Eyes hotel.
We recovered these things from his room... he had checked in as Krishna Nair.
He didn't have anything apart from his clothes... nothing to identify him.
Why is this so heavy?
When your time comes... there's nothing you can do about it.
What's with the long faces, guys?
Shashi bhai is dead.
What?
!
What rubbish?
It's true, he is dead.
Someone shot him last evening at the Mahim carnival.
But what was Shashi doing at the carnival anyway?
Shashi, you better listen to me... stop calling me over and over again.
I told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Shashi is into something big... he took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
Did Shashi have a green bag?
Did he?
I don't want to go back to that life...
Sorry, Mallika.
Madam is calling you.
Shashi paid her for me...
Move it.
- Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- tell them Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- Tehmur!
Armaan Kapoor?
Shashi bhai...
Come in, doctor... the bleeding hasn't stopped.
- Shashi, she needs to be taken to a hospital...
- No, no hospital...
fix her up here... lf you ever say a word about this... I will break your face.
Get it?
Shashi bhai, thanks for the payback.
We had to report to the income-tax department because the 2 million was in cash.
You'll have to apply for a refund.
How did Armaan know...
that guy Shashi?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
Why was he blackmailing Armaan?
Sonya, he said he doesn't know.
You think it's possible that...
Armaan was using prostitutes?
Sonya, please... I want to know the truth.
I'm not really sure... but, yes it's possible.
Hello?
I'm Shashi's friend.
Excuse me.
Who is this?
- l just told you!
Remember Shashi?
You called him to the carnival... and you killed him.
I'm in a meeting right now... let me call you back in some time.
Please, don't bother... I'll call you back in an hour... you better answer or you will regret it.
Okay.
He's taken the bait!
Jackpot!
Who would have thought you were so smart, Tehmur?
Tell me... I want five million.
What?
What for?
To keep your secret safe.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, don't waste my time.
Okay then, you'll hear from the cops... once they get Shashi's phone sim and the DVD.
- lf that's not good enough... I know about the girl too.
I'm in trouble, dad.
It's a real mess.
What is it?
Armaan and I... some people have been blackmailing us.
What?
Who are these people?
Do you remember Nikhil's accident?
Of course.
He didn't fall from the balcony of our Juhu bungalow... I lied to you.
Actually, he fell off a moving car... it was an accident, dad.
How come you're home so early!
Are you complaining?
Suri!
Do you have to go back?
No.
Then let's go out.
Where?
Let's go for a movie... and then we'll eat out...
Please, Suri... come on...
Please!
I couldn't stop laughing!
How did you like the film?
I was watching you, actually... it's good to see you happy.
Thank you, Roshni...
For seeing the therapist... I know it can't be easy for you... but I think it's really helping you.
- Hi Roshni aunty...
- Samar!
What brings you to Mumbai?
My cousin is getting married next week... I was going to call you...
Samar's been looking forward to seeing you.
If you're free one evening, come over... have dinner with us.
Sure, why not!
How about Friday?
I'm working late on Friday.
What about Saturday?
Actually, I'm busy all week... I'm working on a new case, sorry, I'm really pressed for time.
No problem... you cops do work long hours.
I can't believe you did that!
They must have felt so bad... they are our friends, Suri.
That doesn't mean I have to meet them... I'm not stopping you from meeting them.
Every time I look at Samar...
He is only a child, Suri... what happened wasn't his fault.
I know... the fault was mine.
It was an accident, Suri.
No, it was negligence... on my part.
Instead of keeping an eye on them, I fell asleep.
So did I... we didn't know the kids would do something like that.
Please, Suri.
Don't blame yourself.
You can say what you want now, Roshni... but I know how you look at me sometimes...
But... I've never blamed you... I've never thought like this...
But I do... every single day.
Don't... you mustn't blame yourself... come on... let's go in and talk.
No, I've got some work.
Please, Suri.
Suri...
This illness you have of the heart
I don't seem to understand at all
You abandon everything that's near and dear
And what remains distant you seem to call
My heart is listless!
Without you.
My heart is listless!
Without you.
I don't know why
And I don't know how
There exists an invisible tension
One that tugs
One that leads
One that tugs One that leads
Me in your direction I am the mystery I am that story
That doesn't have an end
Come closer and you shall see
Come closer and you shall see
The distance remains and is meant to be
My heart is listless!
Without you.
My heart is listless!
Without you.
What I haven't been able to unravel ls the riddle that you are
No one knows the secret
No one knows the secret
The secret who's friend you are I smile, and hide from the world
How restless I am day and night lt's been a while since I shut my eyes lt's been a while since I shut my eyes
Been a while since I felt peace inside
My heart is listless!
Without you.
My heart is listless!
Without you.
Don't you ever go home?
And when do you sleep?
Hmm?
I need to ask you something... I'll come back later if you are busy.
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
How does it matter?
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here... lsn't it peaceful here?
Why are you so sad?
What makes you say that?
Fine, you don't have to talk about it.
Let's talk about something else... how's the investigation going?
I heard Shashi was killed.
I don't know what I am looking for.
Every clue seems to lead to a blank... I feel like the answers are staring me in the face... but I can't see them.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Did Shashi ever make you meet... anyone famous?
Meet anyone famous?
You want to know if I slept with Armaan Kapoor?
Then ask me straight... I won't be offended... it's my job.
The answer is no... but his friend was a regular client.
And I met Armaan once with him.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
You never asked me.
When was this?
Three years ago...
Armaan wasn't as famous back then...
He came with Nikhil, his friend.
There was another guy with them.
We went for a drive...
That's all.
This other guy... was his name Sanjay Kejriwal?
I don't know his name... but I'd recognise him if I saw him.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
If you want to get out... I can help you.
I know.
But not yet... there are some things I need to take care of... let me get done with that.
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
I have to say... you're really different.
Trust me, you don't belong here either.
How's that?
Well, you actually care about people... without wanting anything in return.
Not too many people like that around here.
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
No one's heard of her since... no one knows if she is dead or alive... and no one cares.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
Did you report it to the cops?
Are you crazy?
I think I should remind you about the laws in our country.
Prostitution is still illegal.
We don't even exist... and if we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Hello, I'm Inspector Shekhawat... and I'm here to see Nikhil Deshpande.
He wants to meet Nikhil.
Nikhil... look, someone's come to see you.
Doctors are not sure how much he can understand...
He understands everything, I know it.
- He hasn't spoken since the accident.
The profits recorded went up by 8 percent... and, this trend indicates that... there is a substantial growth in this sector.
And, according to--
Hello?
hold on for a second...
Guys...
I have to take this call so... please continue...
Okay, as I was saying... according to this trend... I want to meet with you.
You got the money?
Are you listening to me?
I want to meet--
You think I'm an idiot?
I know what happened to Shashi.
I didn't kill Shashi.
I was at the carnival with the money... waiting for Shashi.
I've been paying him off for years, why would I have him killed?
I can ruin you in a matter of hours...
What will you get out of it?
Think about it...
- lf you're ready to meet, I will bring the money... at a place and time of your choice.
Why are the lights switched off...
Come...
Devrath, come in...
This way, Devrath...
Nice house, sir.
Roshni...
Looks like my wife is out...
Would you like a drink?
I don't mind...
Whisky, right?
Yes, sir.
Soda or water?
Water, sir...
And ice?
Okay.
Sorry, Devrath... I think Roshni forgot that you were coming over for dinner... she's out for a film with a friend.
It's okay, sir.
Hello Suri, how're you doing?
Sorry to disturb your film, but I need to speak with Roshni...
- l can't get through her phone.
What film?
- Roshni's not with me, Suri.
- ls everything okay?
Yeah...
I'm sorry...
I got it wrong... it slipped my mind, sorry...
Devrath, do you know where Billimoria lives?
Sir... block-2, ground floor...
What's wrong, sir?
Sir...
Where is Roshni?
She's inside...
you have to wait here.
You can't go in there...
Sir... you can't...
Suri... I warned you to stay away... didn't I?
Suri...
Suri... stop it...
Have you lost it, Roshni?
What are you doing here?
Karan is dead, he can't talk to you.
I don't blame you for your anger, it comes from the pain within--
That's enough!
If you can really talk to Karan, tell him to appear now... I want to see him...
where is he?
I can't do that.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form... but Karan didn't have a problem moving to the afterlife... he had a smooth passage.
Unbelievable!
A smooth passage?
He was only 8 and he drowned to death!
How smooth is that?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
I didn't choose this life... it chose me.
- Let's go...
- No, Surjan... listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
When my husband died, I was very depressed... and that's when the spirits started communicating with me.
Let's go!
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
- Stop it, Suri, let go of me!
Stop it!
Suri!
How could you lie to me?
You hid all this from me?
How can I tell you the truth?
You are never home.
Don't change the subject.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
You're highly educated...
you taught science to kids... think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
I don't know what I believe... but I know she has told me things... that only Karan knew about.
It makes me happy... why don't you understand?
Suri...
Karan wants to talk to you!
You've lost it completely, Roshni.
You need help.
I don't need help... I need to talk to you...
Can you talk to me?
Can you stay home one night with me?
Can we live like a couple and not like strangers?
I'll see you later, sir.
Hold on!
You work with him, right?
Are you also out every night?
is your wife okay that you never come home?
Where do you go, Suri?
Have I ever asked you?
Who are you with every night?
I know you are not working... I know you are with someone.
I don't know where you go or what you do... but it keeps you going... it makes you happy.
So why can't I do something that gives me peace and happiness?
See you later, sir.
All couples go through phases...
Suri and you have been through hell... give it time...
this too shall pass.
I don't think so.
Have you thought about having another child?
Suri would not hear of it.
I tried bringing it up but... he didn't want to talk about it.
I think he is having an affair.
What?
No way... that's impossible...
Roshni, we're talking about Suri.
I asked him straight out... he didn't even deny it.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Are you falling for me, officer?
I'm kidding!
What do you want to ask me?
Are you... are you okay?
I am very tired...
Come with me... come on...
Please don't misunderstand... I just want to talk.
If someone says that to me... I suppose, I should be offended.
Come here... I won't bite.
This is my wife, Roshni... and this is Karan... my son.
Your wife is very beautiful.
Roshni and I were very happy...
What happened then?
Karan... ls anyone really happy?
Are you happy?
I have my moments.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Try me...
Some other time perhaps...
Can you do me a favour, please?
What?
Remember Mallika?
Shashi's girlfriend?
Yeah...
She is in a mess... can you help her?
What happened to her?
Close your eyes...
Hey you... get Mallika.
Okay, sir.
Where's Mallika?
For today I'm Mallika... what do you want?
Police business, get her.
She's out.
Call her out or I'll come back with a warrant... and that will be the end of you.
Who did this to you?
Shashi paid her off for me... now she denies it... and is forcing me back to work.
If you want to get out of here, sit in the car.
They won't let me leave...
Don't worry about them...
get in the car.
Trust me... don't be scared.
Where do you think you're going?
Go stop her!
Come back here...
Let me file these papers.
She is a good woman.
She will help you.
Sir... thank you.
Don't thank me, thank Rosie... she told me about you.
Rosie?
Who's she?
She is one of Madam's girls.
I don't know who you're talking about...
That's how it is with us girls...
today Rosie, tomorrow Jasmine.
That's how we play it.
Sir... I...
lied to you earlier.
Shashi knew Armaan Kapoor.
Shashi met Armaan Kapoor... on the night of his accident.
Do you know why?
I never meddled in his work.
But, you know what... you should get hold of that slime Tehmur... I'm sure he knows something.
After everything Shashi did for him...
Tehmur... help me...
- The creep didn't raise a finger to help me.
Tehmur, don't do this...
Shashi was like a brother to you.
- He was trying to steal Shashi's stuff.
What stuff?
It was a green bag... which Shashi had got home that night.
Tomorrow morning at 11:15 at Churchgate station, come alone.
- Bring the money with you... I'll call you with more instructions...
One more thing...
- if I meet with Shashi's fate... whether you're responsible for it or not, the cops will get the stuff.
Fine.
I've to work...
what is it?
I need your help...
My help?
I can't trust anyone but you.
Hold it!
I don't want to get into any mess.
Nirmala... lf this plan works out... you and I can get out of here.
Free as birds... think about it.
I don't know who is the bigger fool... you or I...
Tehmur!
Hello?
Listen carefully... there is a restroom to your right... you'll see a blue bag under the basin, dump the money into it.
- Get it?
Yeah...
- Then head to platform number 4... the train for Virar leaves in 5 minutes...
- get into the compartment next to the first class.
Hurry up, you don't want to miss the train.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Hi darling!
That's a... nice bag...
Who you are working for?
Tell me... I'll make it worth your while.
I can give you a lot more.
Listen!
You're making a mistake.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Where there is happiness ln its shadow I reside
And those who smile
Also have a tear in their eye
Wherever you go
Beneath you the same ground will lie
And above you the same sky I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
I need your help... I can't trust anyone but you.
I don't know who's the bigger fool...
you or I...
Listen...
You have to pretend... not to know me.
Don't talk to me... in fact, don't even look at me.
Corner him!
Catch him!
Where's the money, you jerk!
This guy is operating on his own...
- he confessed everything...
- he worked For Shashi... and happened to stumble upon this...
- he doesn't even know your name...
- he got your number from Shashi's sim card.
Finish him off...
- You will get the rest of your money... and don't call me ever again.
Did you ever think of me?
Did you... even once?
I haven't done anything...
You claimed to be my friend... I did nothing...
Over there...
they pushed him... I will join you on the train.
But if I don't get there... don't wait for me.
Get on the train, come what may.
You've got to be on that train, okay?
!
Simran...
- He said Simran...
- Simran?
Yes, sir, he said Simran... and died.
Sir, the hospital called... that goon is conscious... we can take his statement, should I go?
No, I'll go.
Now listen... you and Rane go to the brothel.
Apparently Tehmur mentioned a 'Simran' before he died...
Find out who this girl is that Tehmur knew... probably one of Madam's girls, bring her in.
It's in your best interest to cooperate with me... or else, the lockup is where you'll be.
Sir is talking to you...
Sir!
the patient is still critical.
- Leave the room...
- But, sir...
Let me do my job.
Get out!
Out!
No one can help you now!
If you are lucky enough to survive... here's what will happen.
I'll take you into my custody and question you... and I have a way of getting the truth.
Then I'll file a case against you... for Tehmur's murder... and I'll make sure you get the death penalty for killing him.
I guarantee you that.
Tehmur was a key police witness... and you were caught red-handed.
Think about it... if you cooperate... I'll save you from the death penalty.
Tell me, who hired you to clear their mess?
Ghorpade, take him into our custody.
I think he prefers to be there.
Sir... the doctor said he can't be discharged...
Tell the doctor he didn't say anything like that.
I want this man in my custody today.
Do whatever it takes.
Yes, sir.
Gokhale... get started... remove these pipes and tubes...
Sanjay Kejriwal!
What?
Sanjay Kejriwal.
Sir, there's no Simran here.
No, sir... a few girls said there was someone called Simran... but she ran away some years ago.
Where could she have gone?
Someone has to know... it's possible that she is still there... and the other girls are trying to protect her.
Tell Rane to stay there and keep looking.
Okay, sir.
- You go to the police station... and meet me at Sanjay Kejriwal's bungalow with a team.
Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
This way, sir.
Inspector Shekhawat!
What brings you here?
Mr. Kejriwal, I have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
On what basis?
For getting Tehmur and Shashi murdered.
Babu Tipnis... you know him already...
He has signed an affidavit implicating you... you have to come with us.
Hand over your mobile phone, please.
Now!
Let's go.
Come on, stand up.
- l said stand up!
- Please... just a minute.
Can we talk?
Go ahead.
In private?
I'm afraid not.
He was blackmailing us... lt all started three years ago.
Armaan, me and our friend, Nikhil...
- were out one night.
I know what we can take to the bachelor party...
Nikhil knew Shashi...
- go to Hotel Lido...
Hello Shashi...
- We went with him to Hotel Lido...
- and there we picked up a girl.
I wasn't happy about it.
What was the girl's name?
Simran.
Nikhil started messing with the girl in the car...
How about a trial...
- What happened next?
I don't know...
- probably the back door wasn't locked properly... lt was an accident!
Nikhil!
Shit!
Nikhil!
Be careful...
- Easy...
- Okay...
Armaan, get into the car now!
Sanjay, we can't leave her in this state...
Dude, you're asking for trouble... we'll get screwed because of this hooker.
Get in the car...
- Please!
- Sanjay?
- Sanjay, we can't leave her here...
what if she dies...
Call that guy, Shashi...
Call Shashi, he will handle it...
Oh God!
Shashi called Armaan a week later... and sent him a DVD... it had footage from the security camera at Hotel Lido... of the three of us leaving the lobby with the girl.
Shashi told us the girl was dead... and he had buried her body somewhere.
Where's the DVD?
I know her, she's the one who has been helping me.
You mean, she is... alive?
Yes, Mr. Kejriwal, I've met her several times... I think Shashi and the girl conned you.
But sir, if that's the case, why would she help you?
Only she can answer that.
Devrath, head to Hotel Lido right now... she might be there... she goes by the name of Rosie nowadays, not Simran... and inform Rane as well.
Get her to the police station immediately.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
If you had informed the police right at the beginning... it would've saved many lives... probably your friend, Armaan's too.
So much happened...
and all for what?
Look out!
- Sir...
- l think only I can see her...
Have you lost your mind, Shekhawat?
Next thing you'll tell me...
is that you saw a ghost!
Don't misunderstand me... I and the police department value you tremendously... but there's talk going on about you that could ruin your career.
Your subordinates have been saying that you don't sleep at night... keep driving all night... you talk to yourself...
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Think about your future, Shekhawat... if you mention this in your official report... you know what's going to happen... you'll be the laughing stock of the department.
I think... you should take a break for two months... you really need it.
But what about the truth?
The truth is that...
Sanjay Kejriwal decided to end his life instead of going to jail.
Armaan Kapoor died in an accident that can only be an act of providence.
And the two men blackmailing them... they're dead.
Case closed!
This is the truth and this will go as your official statement.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
No, Surjan, listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
I can take your pain away.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
If you want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I knew you would be back.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form.
If we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here...
Why don't you understand, Suri?
Karan wants to talk to you!
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
Hello dad, I miss you... I know you miss me a lot too...
What happened that day was not your fault... it was my fault, dad... I am sorry.
There was nothing you could have done to change it... this is what I had to tell you...
Please don't blame yourself... because that makes me very sad.
Please don't fight with mom because of me.
I can never be happy if both of you are so unhappy.
Dad, do you remember telling me... that you always wanted to see me happy?
I know I can count on you to make everything okay... because you are the best dad in the world.
The world may say

It's only the night that brings the forbidden to life
The streets open their arms to whoever passes by
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Yesterday in these very lanes, in these crushed flowers
There was such a high
Now only thirsty spirits, wracked in agony
Seem to wander by
All searching for the same thing
Not knowing the futility it will bring
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Between the lights and among the shadows
An unhappy secret exists
Why is it here?
What has happened for such anger to persist
Tell me oh dark night
Nothing escapes your sight
This is the path for lost souls
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye
A mask is worn to cover the lie lt's so festive all around
Even then only loneliness abounds
Good morning, sir.
Devrath Kulkarni.
So what happened here?
An accident, sir.
The car crashed into the sea.
I've heard a lot about you... it's an honour to work with you.
The car came speeding down the road... and then it swerved... like...
like this... straight into the sea.
Where were you?
I was sitting over there.
Sir...
Pinky knew something was about to happen.
She warned us... but we ignored her.
Who is Pinky?
- Another witness.
- Hello, sir.
That was the only car on the road.
Anything else on the road?
There was absolutely nothing on the road... I saw it...
Sir, please come here.
- Get a stretcher.
That's Armaan Kapoor.
Check if there's any id.
The doors were locked... he was also wearing the seatbelt.
It is him.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
Move away... all of you.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Here.
What happened to Ramu, our driver?
is he...
Mr. Kapoor was driving... he was alone.
Alone?
What about Yuvraj?
His spotboy... he accompanies Armaan everywhere.
There was no one else in the car.
But, Armaan...
Armaan was never on his own.
I don't get it... why was he driving?
He hates driving.
Get Ramu and Yuvraj's number... talk to them.
Good morning, mom.
What's wrong, mom?
- Film starArmaan Kapoor met with an accident... last night on Seaface road.
He died in the crash.
- Seaface road is part of Mumbai's underbelly... famous for the red light area nearby.
It is not clear whatArmaan Kapoor...
- was doing here last night.
- Meanwhile Sonya Kapoor's brother, Teji Singh has stated that...
- the family is not satisfied with the police statement...
- that it was merely an accident.
Right now, we need time to deal with this tragedy...
- only then can we take any legal recourse.
- We still don't know what really happened.
What's wrong, Juhi?
Lost your husband?
Bhai...
Armaan Kapoor is dead.
What?
Armaan Kapoor, the actor... here on Seaface road.
Are you serious?
That's where l'm coming from... it's chaos down there.
The press is all over questioning the junkies.
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Whom did you meet?
Shut up!
You have only one good leg... how about I break that too?
Jinxed bastard...
always arrives with bad news.
Here, get us breakfast.
Move it!
Poor guy, you are so mean to him.
Never repeat what I say to you... in front of others.
Get it?
Sorry.
I said, I'm sorry!
- Sir, is the underworld involved in Armaan Kapoor's death?
- That's all the information we have right now.
I'm here outside Armaan Kapoor's place... he lived in an apartment on the top floor.
People have been pouring in to offer their condolences...
Where is Sonya?
She's upstairs.
Come in Devrath.
Sit.
Tell me.
Armaan Kapoor was shooting at Filmcity on the night of 4th March... for producer Deepak Lalwani's film... they were shooting on floor number 4.
They wrapped the shoot at around 2 AM.
- Pack up!
Good shot, Armaan.
- Both his driver and spotboy were with him at that time.
- Did you talk to them?
- Yes, sir.
- They said Armaan took 15 minutes to change.
- His staff went about routinely packing his things.
But, then something unusual happened.
- Armaan sent them both home from the studio...
- and he drove himself.
- Ramu... you go home, I'll drive myself.
- Come on...
- They also thought it was odd because Armaan didn't like to drive.
When did he leave from Filmcity?
At 2:20 AM.
The accident occurred at 4 AM.
How long does it take to get to Seaface road from Filmcity?
Probably 30 minutes, at night.
Even ifyou give it 45 minutes... where was he for an hour before the accident?
We don't know that yet, sir.
And Seaface road where the accident occurred... is not on his way home.
Inspector Shekhawat...
- Sir, I'm calling from The Times of India to confirm a story.
- Sources tell us that there's an unidentified number on Armaan Kapoor's mobile.
- ls it true that his last call--
His phone was destroyed by the water, it's in the workshop.
Who speaks to the press here?
Come on guys, who here knows journalists... you know, to help me leak a story?
Sir!
Devrath, confiscate their mobiles.
Your phones.
Quick!
This is a high profile case.
No talking to the media.
The autopsy and forensics details... any evidence we get... none of it is to be made public... until this case is solved.
is that clear?
I said, no talking to the media... you can talk to me.
Alright, back to work.
Sir!
I'm Rakesh Rane.
Yes, Rane?
I don't think this case will ever be solved... it's an A-final case, sir.
I mean... there have been similar accidents on that road in the past few years.
All freak accidents... put down as acts of providence... all unexplained.
We didn't get any evidence, whatsoever.
Finally one mystery is cleared... I know why so many officers transfer out ofthis station.
How's it going?
What's up?
Madamji.
Shashi bhai, where did you flick...
I mean buy the belt from?
You again!
Where you offto, Nirmala?
My clients want young girls... not old hags.
The rest ofyou...
let's go.
- Today's clients have flown in from Goa.
Don't listen to him.
You look really nice... I know.
What's the matter, Shashi?
You look tense...
something bothering you?
- Hey!
- Open up!
Shashi...
What were you doing?
Nothing... just trying to rile you up.
Look at you... guess I managed to!
- Shashi bhai, it's me...
Tehmur.
Here's the new sim card, Shashi bhai.
Take that in.
You changing your number?
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
I'm off to my village for a few days.
That's your answer if anyone asks.
Now get lost!
- Take me with you.
- lt's a work-trip...
- not a vacation.
Once it's done, I'II rush back to you.
But until then...
No one must know anything.
- But what was Armaan doing on Seaface road?
Suri, stop being secretive... give us the scoop.
It was an accident.
That's it.
Pass the water, please.
You actually met Sonya Kapoor?
- ls she as beautiful in real life?
- lt is so sad.
He was so young... no?
- He shouldn't have died.
Young people die all the time... but frankly no one--
Sorry.
Don't be silly... you don't need to apologise to us.
How's she doing now?
She's better.
I've spoken to a psychiatrist...
Anjali Punjabi.
Yes, she is quite good.
Yeah, I think it will help Roshni--
Can I get you something?
No, thanks.
Go back.
Stop.
The car was in perfect condition.
- The power brakes were working fine.
He braked here and then swerved... and crashed through those steps into the sea.
Seems like he was trying to avoid hitting something... but there was nothing on the road.
He wasn't drunk either.
Yes, sir.
The reports don't show any traces of alcohol or narcotics.
His lungs were filled with water.
- Cause of death is drowning.
- Sir... it seems like one of those A-final cases...
- none of it makes any sense.
Come on.
- Thousands have gathered on the streets to pay their last respects...
- to beloved bollywood actor Armaan Kapoor...
- Yes?
- Hello.
I'm Frenny Mistry... I live in the neighbourhood... thought I'd welcome you.
There was no need for this...
Darling, everybody needs cheese cake!
You need any help?
Oh no... I'm fine... just some boxes left to unpack.
Call me if you need anything... I have a number for everything.
Carpenter, electrician, plumber, anything you need... I know them all!
Thank you.
I would love some tea.
Of course, please sit.
So, you're alone at home all day... while your husband is out chasing robbers?
How long have you been married?
12 years.
- Milk and sugar?
Yes, dear...
- two spoons.
Hello, Karan.
Hello, Inspector.
Hello.
This is Sanjay...
Armaan's best friend.
Hello.
- Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Sonyaji, we still don't know where your husband was heading that night... or why he was on that road.
And the accident?
It's still a mystery why he steered the car off the road... and crashed into the sea.
Sonyaji... may I ask you something?
Sure.
Was something bothering Mr. Kapoor?
I mean, was he depressed or disturbed?
Armaan did not kill himself, Inspector.
- Why would he kill himself?
Because you can't figure out what really happened?
Just this morning my accountant told me... he had given Armaan 2 million rupees in cash that day.
Why?
We don't know.
- l gave him the money... at around 7:30 in the evening.
- Why didn't you inform Sonyaji about this before?
Sir, I did try... but she was in a state of shock, so I couldn't speak to her.
- Was the money in 500 rupee bills?
No, sir, 1000 rupee bills.
The money was in a green Puma bag.
But we didn't get any such bag in the car.
- Didn't you pack Armaan's stuffthat night?
What all was there?
His gym bag... music system, lunch box... and... a bag that the accountant gave him.
A red bag?
No, sir, a green one.
What was in it?
Did you open it?
No, sir, I never open his bags unless he asked me to.
Sure?
Yes, sir.
Did Mr. Kapoor tell you who the bag was for?
No.
Has this ever happened before?
Twice.
And once... about a year ago, on Mr. Kapoor's instructions... I personally dropped off 1 million rupees at Hotel Lido.
It's quite close to where...
the accident took place.
Why?
I don't know, sir.
I was instructed to... give the bag to the receptionist.
- Hello, sir.
What's the problem?
Anand Murugan used to work here, I want to know his whereabouts.
Murugan?
He was a receptionist here for 4 years.
Of course!
He quit and...
we haven't heard from him.
- ls it extortion?
- Sir, blackmail seems more likely.
If it were extortion he would've told someone about it... but, neither his wife nor his friends know anything.
is the blackmail connected to his death?
I don't think so... but there are a lot of unanswered questions.
Today Armaan's wife has filed an fir.
That's all we need right now.
Do we use the entire police force to solve this hero's case?
Sir, I think once we get to Murugan we'll have a lot more answers.
- Then find him quickly.
- Sir.
- Sir...
Shashi here.
- Where the hell have you been?
- l have been trying desperately to call you.
I had to change my number... need to lie low.
- What happened with Armaan that night?
How should I know?
I wasn't there.
- Don't bullshit me.
- The police know about the 2 million!
You handle them... now back to business... I was promised 5 million... you owe me 3 more.
Why are kids made to dance to film songs?
is there nothing better to do?
The kids were good.
- Roshni...
- Roshni!
Who is this lunatic?
- Hello dear.
- Hello.
This is my husband, Suri.
Hello...
This is Frenny, our neighbour.
She lives with her brother, Inspector Billimoria.
I've met your brother.
Poor you, dear.
Are you heading home?
Yes.
How are you, Surjan?
I'm fine, why?
Nothing... well...
actually, I wanted to meet you.
For a while now.
Well... I have a message for you.
Message?
From whom?
From your son...
Karan.
He wants me to tell you that... ls this a joke?
No, please hear me out...
Karan wants me to tell you that he wants to talk to you.
Shut up!
Just shut up!
We don't want to hear anything.
Stay away from us.
Get it?
I mean it!
Let's go.
Karan said...
'Tell Dada I am fine'.
'Not to worry.'
'Tell Dada I want to talk to him.'
How does she know Karan called you Dada?
Didn't you say... she barged in and asked personal questions.
But... I didn't mention anything about Karan to her.
I can't believe the things people do for money.
But what if it's true?
What?
What if... she really did talk to Karan?
Karan is dead, Roshni.
He can't talk to anyone.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Don't believe in such stuff, Roshni.
That's nonsense.
Please don't do this to yourself and me.
Suri, all I am saying is...
can we hear her only once-- l'm sorry, I can't have this conversation.
It's too ridiculous, I'm leaving.
Suri, please... only once--
Suri!
Dada...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
- Karan, don't wander too far off.
- Okay.
- Karan!
Karan!
- Suri, find him.
Karan!
- Karan!
Looks like you need some love.
I can take your pain away.
Save it for someone else... I'm a cop.
I've always had shitty luck... I'm only getting started for the night and you call it a day!
But, it's okay, officer... take me with you.
Arrest me!
How will that help?
When you're already in hell.
Perhaps... but I know the way to heaven.
- Right down this road...
Hotel Lido.
There's heaven in every room.
Hotel Lido, that place nearby?
The receptionist is a friend... he won't charge a thing.
Get in.
You men are all the same.
How long have you been working in Lido?
Seven years.
Do you know Murugan?
Anand Murugan?
He was a receptionist there.
Why?
I'm looking for him.
But... no one seems to know where he is.
Everyone know he is dying in Melur...
aids is bad for business.
So, the manager sent him away.
Thank you.
That's it?
That's it.
Don't shoo me off... I can really help you.
I'II find you when I need you... now go.
Missing me already?
What's your name?
Rosie.
Good night, Rosie.
Where can I find Anand Murugan?
That way.
Anand Murugan?
Sir, Devrath here.
- You were right, Murugan has AIDS.
- About a year ago he got a bag from Armaan Kapoor's accountant.
- For a guy called Shashi.
Now who's Shashi?
He's a pimp.
He works out of Hotel Lido.
Shashi gave Murugan Rs. 2000 for the bag.
I hope Murugan isn't lying.
I don't think so.
He is dying, why would he lie?
- Where is Shashi?
- He told me he was going to SangIi for some work.
What work?
That he didn't tell me.
When is he expected?
I don't know.
Listen to me...
Shashi is in trouble.
If you want to help him, tell me where he is.
Sir, I really don't know.
Did Shashi ever mention anything about Armaan Kapoor?
- Where is Shashi?
- l don't know.
- Haven't seen him around.
I heard he went back to his village.
Where is that?
You know, a place that has cows and bullock carts.
A village.
You're quite a good comedienne.
But, unfortunately for you... it's not easy to make me laugh.
You have two options.
Either you give us Shashi's address... or we can take a drive to the station.
Hold on.
You can'tjust arrest me.
Devrath, she really is funny... she's made me smile too.
Christina, get me my diary.
- Sir, Shashi didn't come here to Sangli.
Just as I thought.
You can come back.
Tell the cops there to keep an eye on his family.
We have to find this guy no matter what!
I need these pills.
Karan liked to play in water.
Ever since he was little.
When I'd get the water ready for his bath... he'd be so happy.
He would fill his mouth and spout water on me.
He wouldn't stop laughing!
Karan loved to be in water... did he have to drown and die?
Losing a child is a very traumatic experience.
I empathise with you... but life does take unexpected turns.
Sometimes we end up losing people that we love.
But we have to carry on.
Be patient, Roshni.
I can assure you that with the help of these sessions and medication... you will get out ofthis.
And you have your husband for support as weIl...
Along with Karan... I also lost Suri.
The fact is Suri needs your help more than I do.
I don't know what he thinks... or what he feels.
He doesn't talk to me.
You know... he never talks about Karan.
Never.
Do you feel Suri doesn't care?
No, he does care.
If he didn't... he'd be able to sleep.
My sadness is met with a silence from you
Time is to blame and that is the truth
Beat after beat a sorrow continues to stay
Then why does the heart still seem to say
Live a Iittle
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Yes this life has been full of pain
But there is a solace too that it contains I am yours and you are mine
And we hope that this won't ever change
Then why has the road that leads me to you broken down
Why are we meeting life with a frown
Come let's open the doors, let it all go
Let's cry our hearts out, let the tears flow
Live a Iittle
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
Let the pain clouds drift away
Allow life to blossom a little each day
Leave the past where it belongs
And listen to what the heart has to say
Live a Iittle
The heart says live a little
My fellow traveller, my soul mate
Come a little closer and live a little
- Sir, the guy in the yellow t-shirt is Tehmur, Shashi's confidant.
- He's walking towards you.
Alright.
Tehmur!
Me... sir?
You are Tehmur, right?
What do you do?
I'm a beggar.
I'm very poor...
don't even have enough to eat.
Sir, I haven't done anything...
- Sir, where are you taking me?
- Get him in!
- Speak up!
He's not talking.
Sir, I really don't know where Shashi is...
Sir, I swear I don't know anything.
Shut up!
Sir is an encounter specialist.
Afew days ago he shot dead some goons!
You better talk.
Sir, trust me, I really don't know anything.
What will you do if Shashi calls you?
I'II inform you.
What if you don't?
You can chop off my legs!
You can go.
Really?
Now get lost!
Shashi has never treated you well.
He treats you like a dog!
I suggest you come clean to Inspector Shekhawat.
And save yourself.
Pande, you know me well.
I'm not trying to help Shashi... nor am I being a hero.
I want to stay away from it all.
Shashi is into something big.
Shashi took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
He can't escape... sooner or later we will get him.
We're sorry.
The number you've reached is not in service.
Tehmur, give us some water.
- Shashi, You better listen to me.
- Stop calling me so many times.
- l told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
- Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
- lfyou want the money, don't call again.
Seen Shashi around?
No, sir... I knew you would be back.
Why?
Everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
You were right about Murugan.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Because cops don't really help the people here.
Cops treat everyone alike.
You're really funny, you know that?
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
That's not why I'm here.
Then, why are you here?
Don't lie to me.
I can sense you are lonely.
No fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I am not here to play games.
Do you know Shashi?
Shashi?
What's there to know?
He is a jerk.
Do you work for him?
I am one of his top girls.
Where is he right now?
I don't know.
I'm looking for him... will you help me?
Get your team to fill in for me... and I'll step in for them... as a cop.
Ifyou want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms... but how long can he stay submerged... sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Shashi is playing a big game this time... it involves millions.
So, tell the cops... to arrest him and chop his balls off!
No, it's time for my payback... I've done enough dirty work for him.
Shashi won't do anything for you.
He better.
He owes me.
I want to ask you something.
I need you to be sober when I say this... I need to be drunk to do my job.
Ask me...
Nirmala... lf l hit the big time... and make lots of money... will you marry me?
Did the cops hit you on your head?
Come on, answer me... will you come with me?
Stop building these castles in the air.
I'm a whore and I'll always be one... and you'll always be a whore's lame son!
Stay away from Shashi's rackets ifyou want to stay alive...
Mom, can we go for a walk?
Okay.
Karan... wait... don't go...
Dada...
Let's play checkers instead.
Alright!
Who wants red?
- l...
- l!
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
- Okay.
Karan... wait... I'll come with you.
- Mom, can we go for a walk?
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I need your help.
Can you call my mom and dad?
I want to talk to them... their names are Roshni and Surjan.
Please tell them, I want to talk to them.
I'm Karan Shekhawat... I want to talk to my mom and dad...
Concentrate, my dear.
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
I am here to speak to Karan...
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?
Hello mom... I'm right here with you... I'm happy that I'm speaking with you.
Thank you, mom.
Please tell dad that... I really want to talk to him... I know you and dad are sad because of me.
I am always with you...
Please don't cry, mom.
I want to see you smiling like this always.
I can sense you are lonely... no fun with the wife anymore.
Am I right?
I knew you would be back... everyone gives in to my charm... how would you escape?
I am not here to play games.
Then, why are you here?
Do you know Shashi?
I suggest you keep your beautiful eyes open... I don't know where Shashi is... he's probably in a drunken haze drowned in somebody's arms...
- What is it?
Some creep tied stones to a girl's body and threw it in the sea.
But how long can he stay submerged...
- The body did not surface for four days.
Sooner or later he'll have to surface.
Have you sent it for post-mortem?
No, sir, we're trying to get identification.
- What did you just say?
- Sir!
A girl's body has surfaced in Mahim Creek... the killer tied stones to her body before drowning her.
She was killed four days ago.
Devrath!
Send Shashi's photo and description to all morgues and hospitals... immediately!
- Last evening at approximately 8:30...
- a clean shot through the head...
- the killer was at a distance of almost 300 metres.
- The shell casing and gunshot wound prove that a .315 calibre rifle was used.
- Definitely a professional hit.
- We got these keys from his pocket, of a room at the golden Eyes hotel.
We recovered these things from his room... he had checked in as Krishna Nair.
He didn't have anything apart from his clothes... nothing to identify him.
Why is this so heavy?
When your time comes... there's nothing you can do about it.
What's with the long faces, guys?
Shashi bhai is dead.
What?
!
What rubbish?
It's true, he is dead.
Someone shot him last evening at the Mahim carnival.
But what was Shashi doing at the carnival anyway?
Shashi, you better listen to me... stop calling me over and over again.
I told you that you'll get the money tomorrow.
Come to the Mahim carnival at 8 pm tomorrow.
You ask too many questions... are you a lawyer?
!
So, you really met him last night?
I thought you were bluffing.
Shashi is into something big... he took 2 million from Armaan Kapoor.
Did Shashi have a green bag?
Did he?
I don't want to go back to that life...
Sorry, Mallika.
Madam is calling you.
Shashi paid her for me...
Move it.
- Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- tell them Shashi paid her for my freedom...
- Tehmur!
Armaan Kapoor?
Shashi bhai...
Come in, doctor... the bleeding hasn't stopped.
- Shashi, she needs to be taken to a hospital...
- No, no hospital...
fix her up here... lfyou ever say a word about this... I will break your face.
Get it?
Shashi bhai, thanks for the payback.
We had to report to the income-tax department because the 2 million was in cash.
You'll have to apply for a refund.
How did Armaan know...
that guy Shashi?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
Why was he bIackmailing Armaan?
Sonya, he said he doesn't know.
You think it's possible that...
Armaan was using prostitutes?
Sonya, please... I want to know the truth.
I'm not really sure... but, yes it's possible.
Hello?
I'm Shashi's friend.
Excuse me.
Who is this?
- l just told you!
Remember Shashi?
You called him to the carnival... and you killed him.
I'm in a meeting right now... let me call you back in some time.
Please, don't bother... I'll call you back in an hour... you better answer or you will regret it.
Okay.
He's taken the bait!
Jackpot!
Who would have thought you were so smart, Tehmur?
Tell me... I want five million.
What?
What for?
To keep your secret safe.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, don't waste my time.
Okay then, you'll hear from the cops... once they get Shashi's phone sim and the DVD.
- lfthat's not good enough... I know about the girl too.
I'm in trouble, dad.
It's a real mess.
What is it?
Armaan and I... some people have been blackmailing us.
What?
Who are these people?
Do you remember Nikhil's accident?
Of course.
He didn't fall from the balcony of our Juhu bungalow... I lied to you.
Actually, he fell off a moving car... it was an accident, dad.
How come you're home so early!
Are you complaining?
Suri!
Do you have to go back?
No.
Then let's go out.
Where?
Let's go for a movie... and then we'll eat out...
Please, Suri... come on...
Please!
I couldn't stop laughing!
How did you like the film?
I was watching you, actually... it's good to see you happy.
Thank you, Roshni...
For seeing the therapist... I know it can't be easy for you... but I think it's really helping you.
- Hi Roshni aunty...
- Samar!
What brings you to Mumbai?
My cousin is getting married next week... I was going to call you...
Samar's been looking forward to seeing you.
Ifyou're free one evening, come over... have dinner with us.
Sure, why not!
How about Friday?
I'm working late on Friday.
What about Saturday?
actually, I'm busy all week...
I'm working on a new case, sorry, I'm really pressed for time.
No problem... you cops do work long hours.
I can't believe you did that!
They must have felt so bad... they are our friends, Suri.
That doesn't mean I have to meet them... I'm not stopping you from meeting them.
Every time I look at Samar...
He is only a child, Suri... what happened wasn't his fault.
I know... the fault was mine.
It was an accident, Suri.
No, it was negligence... on my part.
Instead of keeping an eye on them, I fell asleep.
So did I... we didn't know the kids would do something like that.
Please, Suri.
Don't blame yourself.
You can say what you want now, Roshni... but I know how you look at me sometimes...
But... I've never blamed you... I've never thought like this...
But I do... every single day.
Don't... you mustn't blame yourself... come on... let's go in and talk.
No, I've got some work.
Please, Suri.
Suri...
This illness you have ofthe heart
I don't seem to understand at all
You abandon everything that's near and dear
And what remains distant you seem to call
My heart is listless!
Without you.
I don't know why
And I don't know how
There exists an invisible tension
One that tugs
One that leads
One that tugs One that leads
Me in your direction I am the mystery I am that story
That doesn't have an end
Come closer and you shall see
The distance remains and is meant to be
My heart is listless!
Without you.
What I haven't been able to unravel ls the riddle that you are
No one knows the secret
The secret who's friend you are I smile, and hide from the world
How restless I am day and night
It's been a while since I shut my eyes
Been a while since I felt peace inside
My heart is listless!
Without you.
Don't you ever go home?
And when do you sleep?
Hmm?
I need to ask you something... I'II come back later ifyou are busy.
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
How does it matter?
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here... lsn't it peaceful here?
Why are you so sad?
What makes you say that?
Fine, you don't have to talk about it.
Let's talk about something else... how's the investigation going?
I heard Shashi was killed.
I don't know what I am looking for.
Every clue seems to lead to a blank... I feel like the answers are staring me in the face... but I can't see them.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Did Shashi ever make you meet... anyone famous?
Meet anyone famous?
You want to know if I slept with Armaan Kapoor?
Then ask me straight... I won't be offended... it's myjob.
The answer is no... but his friend was a regular client.
And I met Armaan once with him.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
You never asked me.
When was this?
Three years ago...
Armaan wasn't as famous back then...
He came with NikhiI, his friend.
There was another guy with them.
We went for a drive...
That's all.
This other guy... was his name Sanjay Kejriwal?
I don't know his name... but I'd recognise him if I saw him.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
Ifyou want to get out... I can help you.
I know.
But not yet... there are some things I need to take care of... let me get done with that.
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
I have to say... you're really different.
Trust me, you don't belong here either.
How's that?
Well, you actually care about people... without wanting anything in return.
Not too many people like that around here.
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
No one's heard of her since... no one knows if she is dead or alive... and no one cares.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
Did you report it to the cops?
Are you crazy?
I think I should remind you about the laws in our country.
Prostitution is still illegal.
We don't even exist... and if we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Hello, I'm Inspector Shekhawat... and I'm here to see Nikhil Deshpande.
He wants to meet Nikhil.
NikhiI... look, someone's come to see you.
Doctors are not sure how much he can understand...
He understands everything, I know it.
- He hasn't spoken since the accident.
The profits recorded went up by 8 percent... and, this trend indicates that... there is a substantial growth in this sector.
And, according to--
Hello?
hold on for a second...
Guys...
I have to take this call so... please continue...
Okay, as I was saying... according to this trend... I want to meet with you.
You got the money?
Are you listening to me?
I want to meet--
You think I'm an idiot?
I know what happened to Shashi.
I didn't kill Shashi.
I was at the carnival with the money... waiting for Shashi.
I've been paying him off for years, why would I have him killed?
I can ruin you in a matter of hours...
What will you get out of it?
Think about it...
- lf you're ready to meet, I will bring the money... at a place and time of your choice.
Why are the lights switched off...
Come...
Devrath, come in...
This way, Devrath...
Nice house, sir.
Roshni...
Looks like my wife is out...
Would you like a drink?
I don't mind...
Whisky, right?
Yes, sir.
Soda or water?
Water, sir...
And ice?
Okay.
Sorry, Devrath... I think Roshni forgot that you were coming over for dinner... she's out for a film with a friend.
It's okay, sir.
Hello Suri, how're you doing?
Sorry to disturb your film, but I need to speak with Roshni...
- l can't get through her phone.
What film?
- Roshni's not with me, Suri.
- ls everything okay?
Yeah...
I'm sorry...
I got it wrong... it slipped my mind, sorry...
Devrath, do you know where Billimoria lives?
Sir... block-2, ground floor...
What's wrong, sir?
Sir...
Where is Roshni?
She's inside...
you have to wait here.
You can't go in there...
Sir... you can't...
Suri... I warned you to stay away... didn't I?
Suri... stop it...
Have you lost it, Roshni?
What are you doing here?
Karan is dead, he can't talk to you.
I don't blame you for your anger, it comes from the pain within--
That's enough!
Ifyou can really talk to Karan, tell him to appear now... I want to see him...
where is he?
I can't do that.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form... but Karan didn't have a problem moving to the afterlife... he had a smooth passage.
Unbelievable!
A smooth passage?
He was only 8 and he drowned to death!
How smooth is that?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
I didn't choose this life... it chose me.
- Let's go...
- No, Surjan... listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
When my husband died, I was very depressed... and that's when the spirits started communicating with me.
Let's go!
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
- Stop it, Suri, Iet go of me!
Stop it!
Suri!
How could you lie to me?
You hid all this from me?
How can I tell you the truth?
You are never home.
Don't change the subject.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
You're highly educated...
you taught science to kids... think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
I don't know what I believe... but I know she has told me things... that only Karan knew about.
It makes me happy... why don't you understand?
Suri...
Karan wants to talk to you!
You've lost it completely, Roshni.
You need help.
I don't need help... I need to talk to you...
Can you talk to me?
Can you stay home one night with me?
Can we live like a couple and not like strangers?
I'II see you later, sir.
Hold on!
You work with him, right?
Are you also out every night?
is your wife okay that you never come home?
Where do you go, Suri?
Have I ever asked you?
Who are you with every night?
I know you are not working... I know you are with someone.
I don't know where you go or what you do... but it keeps you going... it makes you happy.
So why can't I do something that gives me peace and happiness?
See you later, sir.
All couples go through phases...
Suri and you have been through hell... give it time...
this too shall pass.
I don't think so.
Have you thought about having another child?
Suri would not hear of it.
I tried bringing it up but... he didn't want to talk about it.
I think he is having an affair.
What?
No way... that's impossible...
Roshni, we're talking about Suri.
I asked him straight out... he didn't even deny it.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Are you falling for me, officer?
I'm kidding!
What do you want to ask me?
Are you... are you okay?
I am very tired...
Come with me... come on...
Please don't misunderstand... I just want to talk.
If someone says that to me... I suppose, I should be offended.
Come here... I won't bite.
This is my wife, Roshni... and this is Karan... my son.
Your wife is very beautiful.
Roshni and I were very happy...
What happened then?
Karan... ls anyone really happy?
Are you happy?
I have my moments.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Try me...
Some other time perhaps...
Can you do me a favour, please?
What?
Remember Mallika?
Shashi's girlfriend?
Yeah...
She is in a mess... can you help her?
What happened to her?
Close your eyes...
Hey you... get MaIIika.
Okay, sir.
Where's Mallika?
For today I'm MaIIika... what do you want?
Police business, get her.
She's out.
call her out or I'II come back with a warrant... and that will be the end of you.
Who did this to you?
Shashi paid her off for me... now she denies it... and is forcing me back to work.
Ifyou want to get out of here, sit in the car.
They won't let me leave...
Don't worry about them...
get in the car.
Trust me... don't be scared.
Where do you think you're going?
Go stop her!
Come back here...
Let me file these papers.
She is a good woman.
She will help you.
Sir... thank you.
Don't thank me, thank Rosie... she told me about you.
Rosie?
Who's she?
She is one of Madam's girls.
I don't know who you're talking about...
That's how it is with us girls...
today Rosie, tomorrow Jasmine.
That's how we play it.
Sir... I...
lied to you earlier.
Shashi knewArmaan Kapoor.
Shashi metArmaan Kapoor... on the night of his accident.
Do you know why?
I never meddled in his work.
But, you know what... you should get hold of that slime Tehmur... I'm sure he knows something.
After everything Shashi did for him...
Tehmur... help me...
- The creep didn't raise a finger to help me.
Tehmur, don't do this...
Shashi was like a brother to you.
- He was trying to steal Shashi's stuff.
What stuff?
It was a green bag... which Shashi had got home that night.
Tomorrow morning at 11:15 at Churchgate station, come alone.
- Bring the money with you... I'II call you with more instructions...
One more thing...
- if I meet with Shashi's fate... whether you're responsible for it or not, the cops will get the stuff.
Fine.
I've to work...
what is it?
I need your help...
My help?
I can't trust anyone but you.
Hold it!
I don't want to get into any mess.
Nirmala... lf this plan works out... you and I can get out of here.
Free as birds... think about it.
I don't know who is the bigger fool... you or I...
Tehmur!
Hello?
Listen carefully... there is a restroom to your right... you'll see a blue bag under the basin, dump the money into it.
- Get it?
Yeah...
- Then head to platform number 4... the train for Virar leaves in 5 minutes...
- get into the compartment next to the first class.
Hurry up, you don't want to miss the train.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Hi darling!
That's a... nice bag...
Who you are working for?
Tell me... I'II make it worth your while.
I can give you a lot more.
Listen!
You're making a mistake.
I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
Where there is happiness ln its shadow I reside
And those who smile
Also have a tear in their eye
Wherever you go
Beneath you the same ground will lie
And above you the same sky I don't know
And neither do you
At which point
What time will choose ln this gamble called life
What will we win
And what will we lose
I need your help... I can't trust anyone but you.
I don't know who's the bigger fool...
you or I...
Listen...
You have to pretend... not to know me.
Don't talk to me... in fact, don't even look at me.
Corner him!
Catch him!
Where's the money, you jerk!
This guy is operating on his own...
- he confessed everything...
- he worked For Shashi... and happened to stumble upon this...
- he doesn't even know your name...
- he got your number from Shashi's sim card.
Finish him off...
- You will get the rest of your money... and don't call me ever again.
Did you ever think of me?
Did you... even once?
I haven't done anything...
You claimed to be my friend... I did nothing...
Over there...
they pushed him... I will join you on the train.
But if I don't get there... don't wait for me.
Get on the train, come what may.
You've got to be on that train, okay?
!
Simran...
- He said Simran...
- Simran?
Yes, sir, he said Simran... and died.
Sir, the hospital called... that goon is conscious... we can take his statement, should I go?
No, I'II go.
Now listen... you and Rane go to the brothel.
Apparently Tehmur mentioned a 'Simran' before he died...
Find out who this girl is that Tehmur knew... probably one of Madam's girls, bring her in.
It's in your best interest to cooperate with me... or else, the lockup is where you'll be.
Sir is talking to you...
Sir!
the patient is still critical.
- Leave the room...
- But, sir...
Let me do my job.
Get out!
Out!
No one can help you now!
Ifyou are lucky enough to survive... here's what will happen.
I'II take you into my custody and question you... and I have a way of getting the truth.
Then I'll file a case against you... for Tehmur's murder... and I'll make sure you get the death penalty for killing him.
I guarantee you that.
Tehmur was a key police witness... and you were caught red-handed.
Think about it... if you cooperate... I'll save you from the death penalty.
Tell me, who hired you to clear their mess?
Ghorpade, take him into our custody.
I think he prefers to be there.
Sir... the doctor said he can't be discharged...
Tell the doctor he didn't say anything like that.
I want this man in my custody today.
Do whatever it takes.
Yes, sir.
Gokhale... get started... remove these pipes and tubes...
Sanjay KejriwaI!
What?
Sanjay KejriwaI.
Sir, there's no Simran here.
No, sir... a few girls said there was someone called Simran... but she ran away some years ago.
Where could she have gone?
Someone has to know... it's possible that she is still there... and the other girls are trying to protect her.
Tell Rane to stay there and keep looking.
Okay, sir.
- You go to the police station... and meet me at Sanjay Kejriwal's bungalow with a team.
Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
This way, sir.
Inspector Shekhawat!
What brings you here?
Mr. Kejriwal, I have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
On what basis?
For getting Tehmur and Shashi murdered.
Babu Tipnis... you know him already...
He has signed an affidavit implicating you... you have to come with us.
Hand over your mobile phone, please.
Now!
Let's go.
Come on, stand up.
- l said stand up!
- please... just a minute.
Can we talk?
Go ahead.
In private?
I'm afraid not.
He was blackmailing us... lt all started three years ago.
Armaan, me and our friend, Nikhil...
- were out one night.
I know what we can take to the bachelor party...
NikhiI knew Shashi...
- go to Hotel Lido...
Hello Shashi...
- We went with him to Hotel Lido...
- and there we picked up a girl.
I wasn't happy about it.
What was the girl's name?
Simran.
Nikhil started messing with the girl in the car...
How about a trial...
- What happened next?
I don't know...
- probably the back door wasn't locked properly... lt was an accident!
NikhiI!
Shit!
NikhiI!
Be careful...
- Easy...
- Okay...
Armaan, get into the car now!
Sanjay, we can't leave her in this state...
Dude, you're asking for trouble... we'll get screwed because of this hooker.
Get in the car...
- Please!
- Sanjay?
- Sanjay, we can't leave her here...
what if she dies...
Call that guy, Shashi...
Call Shashi, he will handle it...
Oh God!
Shashi called Armaan a week later... and sent him a DVD... it had footage from the security camera at Hotel Lido... of the three of us leaving the lobby with the girl.
Shashi told us the girl was dead... and he had buried her body somewhere.
Where's the DVD?
I know her, she's the one who has been helping me.
You mean, she is... alive?
Yes, Mr. Kejriwal, I've met her several times... I think Shashi and the girl conned you.
But sir, if that's the case, why would she help you?
Only she can answer that.
Devrath, head to Hotel Lido right now... she might be there... she goes by the name of Rosie nowadays, not Simran... and inform Rane as well.
Get her to the police station immediately.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
If you had informed the police right at the beginning... it would've saved many lives... probably your friend, Armaan's too.
So much happened...
and all for what?
Look out!
- Sir...
- l think only I can see her...
Have you lost your mind, Shekhawat?
Next thing you'll tell me...
is that you saw a ghost!
Don't misunderstand me... I and the police department value you tremendously... but there's talk going on about you that could ruin your career.
Your subordinates have been saying that you don't sleep at night... keep driving all night... you talk to yourself...
Look at them staring at us...
They probably think... I'm picking you up.
Why would I lie?
People here don't really help the cops.
Think about your future, Shekhawat... if you mention this in your official report... you know what's going to happen... you'll be the laughing stock of the department.
I think... you should take a break for two months... you really need it.
But what about the truth?
The truth is that...
Sanjay KejriwaI decided to end his life instead of going to jail.
Armaan Kapoor died in an accident that can only be an act of providence.
And the two men blackmaiIing them... they're dead.
Case closed!
This is the truth and this will go as your official statement.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
What are you doing here, Rosie?
You don't belong here.
I've been waiting for you... to come along and rescue me.
No, Surjan, listen to me... deal with your pain, or you will attract more of it.
Disturbed spirits are attracted to people in pain... they feel a kindredness.
I can take your pain away.
Some people can talk to spirits...
I have read such things happen...
Think about it, Roshni, use your head... how can you believe this nonsense?
There are many things in this world that can't be explained.
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.
It's not that simple...
Why not?
You wouldn't believe me, if I told you.
Let me take you to a place... where no one will bother us.
Ifyou want, I can figure something out for you...
Really?
What can you do for me?
I knew you would be back.
Only trapped spirits can manifest themselves in human form.
If we don't exist... how can we go missing?
Three years ago a friend of mine... went out with some guys...
She never came back.
I mean, think about it.
A girl just vanishes... and it makes no difference to anyone.
What is this place?
It's my secret spot... hardly anyone ever comes here.
If you can't find me anywhere else... you'll probably find me here...
Why don't you understand, Suri?
Karan wants to talk to you!
And who knows... someday I might end up doing something for you.
Hello dad, I miss you... I know you miss me a lot too...
What happened that day was not your fault... it was my fault, dad... I am sorry.
There was nothing you could have done to change it... this is what I had to tell you...
Please don't blame yourself... because that makes me very sad.
Please don't fight with mom because of me.
I can never be happy if both of you are so unhappy.
Dad, do you remember telling me... that you always wanted to see me happy?
I know I can count on you to make everything okay... because you are the best dad in the world.
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here ln my every thought
Every word spoken ln my every feeling
My every emotion
There is only you
You are everywhere
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say
You are gone
But you are here
You are right here
You never really left my side
You hold my hand even today
No matter what the destination is
You will be my fellow traveller
All the way
The world may say you are gone
But you are here
You are right here
The world may say you are gone
But you are here
You are right here
Thank you \( -o _ o- )/ for the great raw!

Episode Four - "Death Dance Glass"
6 months after Ito Shizuka's disappearance
Do you wanna touch it?
Unexpectedly heavy.
Slide it here, then pull.
How does it feel to really shoot?
First you have to point it in a direction try it.
Pulling the trigger will be the end of him.
Will it shake?
Boss, don't joke about that.
Welcome back.
How are you feeling?
Let me see it.
I told you to go to the hospital!
Don't just stand there serve us drinks!
It's my daughter.
Can I meet her?
If you like.
You can play it.
Still not?
Not time yet.
Shall I make it?
Thanks.
You fancy Kateyama?
What?
It hurts!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
You must not leave this room.
Alright, let's go!
I'll take care of it.
This is too small!
Nanbara!
It's alright.
Bastard!
Get me the stuff and a gun!
Are you an idiot?
Anything on the car from the parking place?
As usual you like to interfere with the traffic division.
Don't say that, still no contact with the owner?
Yeah, it's a detective called Aoki.
Detective?
A former police officer, looks like he was dismissed eaight years ago.
After retiring he's gone shady and dumped it!
[ Metropolitan Police Department Reports that a gun firing occured at 21:42... ]
I'm off!
What about Nanbara?
Nanbara from Tenshu what happened?
A raid?
They really have done it!
We are in the middle of forensic examination!
You reckon it's okay to just enter the crime scene first?
Jurisdicion and prosecution too, wait for orders outside!
It's the fourth division!
It's the same!
Standby!
Yes.
Standby.
Next!
I'm announcing the collaborations.
First division, Igura and Joji.
Next!
Officer Yabe and...
Yes.
...Ayukawa from fourth division.
Yes.
Next!
Takada and Ninomiya from the same department.
I'm Yabu from Nishizabu Station.
Ayukawa from fourth division.
Do you know who owns this house?
No.
So you don't know about their posts either.
Nanbara Yoshio is Tenshu-Azabu groups's head.
From parent organisation Yamato's Okuyama group.
So it's indeed internal dispute?
Yeah, probably.
Considering the conflicts with Tenshu-Chu I thought Nanbara would be taken care of one day.
[ Nishiazabu Police Station ]
Stand up!
Ready,
..bow!
Sit down!
As a matter of security, this incident where fellow gangsters had been firing guns blindly is treated as atrocious and unforgivable.
The background will need to be carefully investigated...
This is going to be a united investigation, so put this case above all other tasks.
Now, summary of the crime from chief Higuchi.
Detailed information is distributed to each individual.
Both parties ended up with gunshot wounds.
Nanbara's wife Esuko died in the living room, along with Motomura Ryuji, and Kobayashi Kazuta.
On the corridor were Kaneda Teppei and Yokomine Junta.
In the kitchen, Katayama Kenji, ...and in the entrance hall was Nanbara Yoshio.
Motomura, Kaneda and Kateyama were members of Tenshu-Azabura group which was represented by Nanbara, ...the remaining ones under Kobayashi are believed to have been the hostile group.
Only one survivor, Tenshu-Chu member Kakimoto Tatsuya.
He is currently being treated at the police hospital.
Rascal with a bad style.
Now first division reports on the motive.
Yes.
To start the internal dispute within the Tenshu, Kobayashi from Tenshu-Chu attacked Tenshu-Azubu's Nanbara-residence.
From the crime scene we seized a large amount of guns and methamphetamine, which are likely to be the main cause of the dispute.
Ayukawa from fourth division, please explain the relation of the two organisations.
I'm Ayukawa.
Around three years ago Tenshu's young leading subordinate, Nanbara Yoshio broke the friendship with group elder Tashiro Eichi and...
Up against former Tashiro's Tenshu-Chu organisation, Nanbara created a new Tenshu-Azabu group that he was leading until now.
But, below the surface the dispute was continuous,..
...therefore I would think it is necessary to look into Tashiro.
We just received a confirmed information.
On the day of the incident a child went missing.
Her name is Nanbara Mio, turning 9 years old.
Her whereabouts are currently unknown, if this turns out to be a kidnapping, then this will disagree to the shooting incident.
Until the truth is confirmed this case is under strict confidentiality.
Anyone leaking out information to the media will be severely punished.
Ayukawa, you are familiar with both organizations then right?
Can you go to the hospital and report on Kakimoto?
What is his condition?
He needs more time for rest to recover.
Ayukawa from fourth division, we are here for special investigation.
Wake up!
Kakimoto, ...not very lucky for your to be the only survivor!
What was your aim originally?
This is not something that has started yesterday!
Ayukawa, that's bad!
What happened to Nanbara's daughter?
Stop that!
I know nothing of a daughter!
Don't play dumb you rascal!
-Wait...
-This is a hospital!
Ayukawa, that's bad!
Excuse me.
There is still time before the meeting...
Is there anywhere to go?
There is a place facing the traffic lights...
Go together?
No, my stomach hurts...
I see.
Take care!
By comparing the bullets left at the crime scene to the guns, it came to light that the whereabouts of the gun that killed Nanbara is unknown.
We are still investigating the crime scene, but it still has not been found.
I wonder where did it disappear?
Someone took it of course, a gun can't walk out on it's own.
The crime lab has reported something
Chief Higuchi please outline.
First, about the attacker Kobayashi group's trespassing...
Looking at the premises, the way of the invasion is believed to have been from the garage to inside.
...the locks were opened by someone and the camera's power was cut so it's highly likely that someone stood as a guide from inside.
Yokomine's car, in which the three attacker arrived, was nowhere to be found.
It's a silver Sedan.
Currently the nameplate is being searched for in the N-system.
Based on the mystery of the gun and the car, it's highly likely that someone took Nanbara Mio.
[ We currently can not deliver this call...]
Aoki Detective Office, currently we are out...
Just where on earth exactly?
We are in charge of the fourth block in the east so I think we should drive.
I'm going to see the crime scene.
That would be bad!
Looking at the crime scene will be more useful than gathering useless information.
Yabu, ...we have just been contacted...
Kakimoto, who has kept silent until now, has said he would help Ayukawa in the search.
What?
But, make sure it doesn't end like last time.
Let's hear it.
10 days ago, brother Kobayashi has obtained a large amount of methamphetamine and guns.
Because of the large amount he panicked and took them to a hideout for safekeeping.
But last week it disappeared.
Was it the guns and drug that were seized from the crime scene?
Yes.
How did you know it was Nanbara?
Via a phone call.
Who from?
A young woman called Aki.
A woman?
Who is she?
A woman who was accompanying Nanbara.
She was a hostess at Club Code that Nanbara was running.
If you don't like it then just finish it off.
Even if I wanted it it's not so simple.
But Nanbara, you are a gangster right?
Aki, you are truly something!
If you were a boy I would make you my underling.
Uncle Nanbara, thanks for the entertainment.
Kakimoto, you must be doing well to come to a high class place like this.
Hey, you teach him about trade.
Well, can't be helped if the old style of maffia business is forgotten.
That woman called me.
That Nanbara hid the goods in a safehouse.
What the hell?
What?
Kakimoto, this is not what you told me!
What's this?
Hey, there is nothing here!
I'm sorry, things changed and Nanbara brough it back to his house.
What?
You kow where he lives right?
That was the same day as the incident.
So you went to raid Nabara's house?
Yes.
That was reckless.
Having the tables turned on you.
But Kobayashi was all out for it, and we didn't retreat.
I think we should think this through once more.
Kakimoto, you have come on a mission and have no faith in it?
That's not it...
Listen, this decision is our chance to take the lead!
Make a contact quick!
Yes.
All according to plan?
OK here.
Alright.
Get the guns.
Who opened the locks?
Aki did, I phoned and asked her to.
So this Aki was at the crime scene.
Sould have been, but I did not see her.
Did you see Nanbara's daughter?
No, but I heard the piano being played, so probably in a different room...
Whos the hell is this woman?
If what he said is true than this woman was observing it all from the same place.
Then she fled with Mio using Tenshu-Chu's car?
But what for?
Yabe, from now on go and report to special investigation.
What?
I'm going to the places Kakimoto mentioned.
Later.
It's not fair to get the proof alone.
Ayukawa,
What?
It's bloodstain.
This is Aki's application form.
So you are Yamamoto Akiko.
If there is a hostess she got on well with, we would like to speak to her.
Yes.
She asked me to do something strange for money.
What kind?
In order to scare Nanbara, I was told to go to Aoki Detective Office and request an infidelity investigation on him.
Infidelity check on Nanbara?
Which Detective Office?
Aoki Detective Office.
Aki assigned this one.
Detective Aoki?
Even though I told her I would not want to be dragged into something strange...
Aoki Detective Office...
A detective called Aoki is it?
Yeah.
So an acquaintance of yours.
He helped out as a police officer some time ago, I owe him...
If that's the case it might not be returnable anymore.
Before the day of the incident, Aoki's card was abandoned in that neighbourhood.
...that and the blood stain earlier...
You think it's Aoki's?
This Aki assigned him to investigate on Nabara's infidelity.
So that woman set him up?
Not just Aoki, but a lot of people from the Tenshu too.
So she was pulling the strings from the background?
Just what on earth for?
Can't be a common relation...
Don't move just yet.
Aki, ...it hurts.
Hey!
Don't come!
Shall we go together?
Get in from the other side.
What's your name?
Nanbara Mio.
Mio!
Are you OK?
Come here!
Can you walk?
This woman, Yamamoto Akiko, is confirmed to be on the run with Nanbara Mio.
We found bloodstains in the vehicle one belongs to Nanbara Mio the other one is highly likely to be this woman's.
If that's the case, these two are sisters.
Sisters?
What's this now?
Whilst DNA analysing the bloodstains we discovered that they both carry the same man's genes.
Yamamoto Akiko being Nanbara's child means that they are sisters coming from different mothers?
If the gun that disappeared was fired by this woman then she killed her own father?
Subtitles by DramaFever
Have you ever felt despair to the point where you want to die?
I have.
What are you doing here?
Ah, that's right.
Forever love, An Na.
I got hit on the same spot again!
How dare you walk in here?
Hey...do you think I came here to see you?
Get out.
Why you!
An Na is sleeping.
Be quiet.
Hurry up and get out.
Even if you ask me not to leave, I'm going to leave.
If I escorted her home like this, don't you think you should at least serve me a glass of water as courtesy?
This is my home.
Get out!
Is that right?
Okay...
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!
Because you're being so petty, I'm leaving without my water.
These shoes are pretty.
Pointy looking stilettos.
Without a doubt...
Hey, Kang Young Gul.
Tell Lee Ga Young to come to my office by 10 a.m. tomorrow.
Why?
You don't need to know.
Just get lost.
When An Na wakes up in the morning...
tell her I'll call her.
By 10 a.m.
When did you get here?
We started again with a lot of difficulty.
Don't you think it would be better, not to do anything that would cause a misunderstanding?
What misunderstanding?
Several misunderstandings.
What does that mean?
I'm saying there are a lot of eyes watching.
So I'm telling you to be careful.
Why?
Did your father say something again?
Did you and my father talk about something?
Why are you asking me that?
What did you two talk about?
He asked me if we're going to get married...
So I told him that we were.
You think you can go to work?
Why?
Did I tell him something wrong?
No.
You did the right thing.
I was hoping we could go to work together, but I don't think that's going to work.
Take your time and come in when you're ready.
Ugh, I can't seem to get rid of my hangover.
The woman last night...it was An Na, right?
You saw?
Yes.
Hey...isn't she still cool as ever?
You know that she's the same age as me?
What was she doing in Dongdaemun?
Hey...don't you think that's all fate and destiny?
What are you going to do about the factory?
What do you mean, what am I going to do?
Aren't you going to pay back your debt?
Why are you talking about the factory, and making me lose my appetite?
If not, how long are you going to stay at someone's store idly like this?
What do you mean, idly?
I do have plans.
What is it?
Hey...
I'm the President, so do I have to answer to you?
Huh?
I'm not eating.
You eat.
How far did your talk with Jung Jae Hyuk go?
What talk?
You said you were getting an order from him.
There's nothing specific that he said to me.
How were you planning on getting an order without any plans?
Here.
No.
Try this one on.
Hello.
Excuse me.
I came to see Director Jung Jae Hyuk.
Where did you come from?
My name is Lee Ga Young.
-Did you make an appointment?
-Yes.
Come in.
Thank you.
Sit down.
What's with your clothes?
Did you design that too?
No, this is Mr. Chil Bok's clothes.
Mr. Chil Bok?
I guess Kang Young Gul was in a rush.
Seeing that he sent his female employee on time.
Since I'm busy, I'll get straight to the point.
It's your designs that I'm interested in, not in Kang Young Gul's factory.
Because of your education, I can't formally hire you.
I'm just hoping that you'll help me out personally.
Since I'm sure you have a design in your head, try making a sample.
All of the materials you'll need are available, so you can use whatever you'd like.
If you need anything else above that, you can request for it.
If by any chance, you need manpower, there are people for sample, patterns, and seamstress too, so you can have any one of them help you.
Whether we like the sample or not, you'll be paid for it, so don't worry.
Now...how much time do you think it'll take?
What you're saying right now...
Means that you're just going to pay me the sample fee and take my whole design?
I'm saying I'm about to give you a chance right now.
I'm thankful that you called... but that's not how I want to hand over my clothes.
Without even showing me the designs, and without even a factory...
Asking me to pay off your debt first, what kind of gall do you have?
Is that the only thing you learned from Kang Young Gul?
Okay.
That self-confidence...
let's see it.
Tell Kang Young Gul to fax over his bank account number and his Business ID.
I understand.
Thank you.
-He says he's going to give it to us?
-Yes.
Hey...does that bastard like you?
-Excuse me?
-Unless he's crazy, how can he agree to give you the money first without seeing the designs?
It's not like that.
For now, he's agreed to paying for the design fee and the sample fees, and once the sample is okayed, then that's when he'll take the full order.
-He wants the business ID?
-Yes.
I can make one then.
What should we name it?
What do you think about Young-Young apparel?
Young-Young Apparel?
Ah... is it a combination of your name and mine?
No.
Na Hon Ah's forever...
I'm Na Hon Ah's fan.
(Young-Young sounds like forever in Korean).
Not bad, right?
Yes.
Did you by any chance, see An Na?
Did you see her or not?
I didn't see her.
Really?
When did he say he's going to give us the money?
I'm sorry about what happened.
I didn't think to go that far, but with everyone showing up here, it turned out that way.
You know, right?
When the flame is hot enough, even a perfectly fine person becomes a dog.
Yes, of course, I know.
And she's not my girlfriend.
Anyways, forget about the past, and start fresh.
I'll see you again soon.
Tell your hot flame girlfriend that I'm really sorry.
Good luck.
-I told you, she's not my flame!
-Thanks.
-Sorry about how things turned out.
-Thanks, see you later.
Hey, Chil Bok.
Tell Ga Young to pack her bags and come to the Chinese Restaurant we used to go to.
Tell her I'll buy her dinner.
Okay.
Why do you keep powdering your face like that for?
You guys are acting like you're about to meet your lover.
Look who's talking.
You're painting your lips red.
When a young man is offering to buy dinner, you should at least make yourself pretty.
Are you saying no matter how young our boss is, he's still a man?
He's not just any man.
He's known as a flower boy around the neighborhood.
That's right.
He really is cute.
It's just because his relationships with women are a little messy, but his face is a work of art.
And look at his body too.
What are we supposed to say to Ga Young when we see her later?
Are we supposed to call her Madame, or something?
-Madame...
-Madame!
How shallow...
Shallow!
Manager!
Look who it is!
-It's President Kang!
-President Kang!
What the heck?
You only see the Manager?
Don't you see us too?
What do you mean, I can't see you?
I've missed all of you so much!
We missed you so much too!
You've suffered a lot, haven't you?
What kind of luck is that?
You must have some bad luck intertwined in your life.
Wait...but what happened to your face?
Who did this to your handsome face?
Who do you think?
I'm sure it was that bastard, Hwang Tae San.
So, is the whole mess with Hwang Tae San's girlfriend all taken care of?
Why don't we all sit down first?
And I'll treat you all big in the meaning of a fresh new start, so order whatever you'd like.
On my...our President Kang is the best!
You've become a big spender since coming back from overseas!
Bong Sook!
You awful bastard!
Take responsibility for my life!
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do about my life?
!
Who's this woman now?
I was deported from America because of you!
Is this woman crazy?
Of all places, did you come to my house...
Were you my enemy in my previous life?
!
Did I hold your hand?
Or even flirt with you or something?
!
Let go of your hand!
Let go!
Why is this lady so strong?
Get away from me!
You shallow little beings!
What?
!
Shallow?
!
Stop it!
Seriously!
Even though I was there illegally...
after awhile, I've learned how to live.
And then...just when I thought I only had to suffer just a little while longer,
I met Ga Young...
and soon after, you showed up.
Because of that...all the money I've saved up until then was all taken away in fines.
And after being deported with nothing to my name...
I couldn't find any jobs here because of my age...
And because it was just so hard to eat and live...
I even thought to kill myself.
But it was so difficult to do it!
I'm sorry.
I overreacted too much earlier.
No, I'm the one who's sorry.
Is your factory around here?
Yes.
By any chance...
are you thinking about hiring anyone?
Even though I have no plans to hire anyone right now... if you'll work together with us, we would be grateful.
Since you put it that way...
I can't turn you down.
Then should I put my skills that I took to New York... to use in your factory?
By any chance... have you heard anything about Ga Young?
-Bong Sook!
-Ga Young!
Oh my!
Ga Young!
Ga Young...
Madame...?
How am I supposed to work on my skills at a place like this?
Seriously...
Look here...why don't you clean over there instead of standing around like that?
Why you Ahjumma!
(Middle aged woman)
Bong Sook.
Where do you live right now?
Why?
By any chance, if it's okay...
can you let Ga Young stay with you?
I'm actually staying with my friend right now...
-By any chance, can I stay here?
-No, you can't.
I don't know.
Gets in the way!
Director, you've got a package.
Hey, Chil Bok.
You know what I told you earlier?
Let's start that.
Therefore, the consensus is that we should go with the modern theme.
This is the end of my presentation.
Is it because you've spent too much energy in New York?
It leaves a little to be desired.
It's not bad.
It's not bad, but...
But it feels a little...boring?
And also the feeling of stubbornness.
Even though an artist needs some stubbornness...
But people who develop pret-a-Porte like us, you also need some ability to get in touch with the general mass too.
Don't you think so, Director Jung?
-Yes.
-Right?
As if...the possibility is being oppressed by the burden of it?
Yes.
After listening to you, I see.
What do you think about changing it a little before the final meeting?
Don't you think so, Director Jung?
I'm sure it'll change.
Why don't we end it here today?
Miss Choi An Na.
I'd like to see you for a moment.
-Who is it?
-Who it is, isn't what's important.
This collection...
Didn't you leave it to me?
That's why I'm asking you for your opinion.
Then...
I can't even know who it is?
That...
I'm sure you'll find out once you start working.
I see you've decided already.
Then why are you asking me?
Is it a matter of formality?
Isn't it a good thing to help fill in where someone is lacking?
You're saying mine isn't going to work.
Is that what you're saying right now?
Why are you taking this so personally?
It's all for our benefit.
We have to succeed this time no matter what.
I didn't know you thought of me to that extent.
I don't even know how to thank you.
What should we do?
If you don't like it that much, forget it.
But you liked it.
You do what you want.
It's me.
Check on Lee Ga Young's progress, and report back to me.
Have you ever seen me run with money?
I'm someone who paid the debt even after coming back from jail.
Have you ever seen anyone like that?
I'm very clear about money.
If this order comes through, you and I are both set!
I told you the items are great!
So if you can lend me some money for what I need...
Come on, President Hwang...
that's not that much!
It's not like you're new to business...
Forget it, forget it.
Just make sure you don't regret it later.
How long do we have to sit around like this?
What do you mean, sit around?
It's because we feel bad about getting paid.
Who in the world pays back all the debt with the fabric and material money?
Hey...do you just use average fabric?
It's because you always use the top of the fabric!
Nice taste you've got there.
It's because if I don't use fabric like that, you don't get the right feel!
Even if that was the case...
Why are you using such a fancy fabric just to make a sample?
You can use just some $2-$3 fabric for a sample, and just showing them this is sort of what it's like...that's a sample.
If it's not the right fabric, no matter what you do, you can't get that feel.
But you're taking it too far.
$150...$2,000 fabric?
Who told you to bring that?
If you keep that up and we don't get an order, what are you going to do about our factory?
You think the employee's salary is going to come out of my butt?
Your expressions are so vulgar.
-What are you imagining?
-Why are you reacting like that?
Since we do have to start...
Go to Jung Jae Hyuk's factory and get us some fabric.
How can I do that after accepting all the money?
That's why I'm telling you to explain our situation and get some fabric from him.
He listens to you.
I can't go because it's too humiliating.
You go.
That bastard doesn't like me.
And I don't like him either.
But you can endure it.
Okay.
Don't go.
We don't have to do the order.
Don't go.
How can we not do it?
After accepting all the money upfront, we have to keep our promise.
There's not a single employee that helps me out...
Do you all have the skills to pull this off without having your President around?
Everyone write in their resignation, and each go our separate ways.
Can't we just use the fabric the other people threw away and use that to make it?
Forget it, forget it.
Forget all about it.
You're so disgusting!
Excuse me.
What brings a Director like you to a lowly place like this himself?
Since you said everything would be okay once you got the factory back, I believed you.
If I hadn't come, it would've been big trouble.
How can you get a sample out of an atmosphere like this?
Is atmosphere what makes clothes?
It's people that makes clothes.
What people?
Those people out there who have nothing to do and are slacking off?
I think there's something wrong here.
But those ladies out there are the type of people who never once left their seat in front of the sewing machine, except to give birth to their children.
Words like artists, and professionals...
they're not wasted on those people!
Do you understand?
But why did you come here?
Did you come to check and see if we're working or not?
Have some.
Thank you.
Drink it.
Lee Ga Young.
Yes?
You think you can pull it off?
Yes.
The way I see it...
I don't think you can pull it off.
I'm so very thankful for the money you gave us in advance...
But I don't think it's right for you to drop in whenever you want to check on us like this.
Lee Ga Young.
Go wait outside for a moment.
Let's do it this way.
Send Lee Ga Young to my company only until the sample's are completed.
Are you saying you're going to pull out our most valued employee from our factory?
I'm just saying I'm going to borrow her for just a moment.
Don't you think that's better for you too?
It looks like you don't even have the money to buy the fabric after paying your debt back.
Or we can say this never happened and give me all the money back.
If you're going to take one of my employees... you know that there will be additional salary, health care and other benefits needed, right?
What are you doing here?
Have you had dinner?
I'm not hungry.
Should we just move in together?
It's nice not having to waste time coming and going like this.
I think father liked you.
He's not someone to say something like this... but he said that you're working hard.
He said he'll wait and see with anticipation.
Why are you laughing?
When you're not even expecting anything...
What's so important about the chairman expecting anything?
Are you really going to be like this?
!
Why do you think I showed you those designs, huh?
Is that something to be upset about?
It's all so that we can do better!
Did I say anything?
I know.
That you intended to help.
If you know, don't get your pride up in shackles.
I'm going to do it all in your name, and I'm going to have it look as though you did everything from beginning to end.
So don't worry about it.
-Did it work?
-Yeah.
Let me see it.
President.
President!
-What?
-I'm going to go to work.
Come back soon.
What do I do about lunch when I go there?
Hey...why are you asking me that?
Ask that to him when you get there!
-Why would you ask me that...
-Give me some lunch money.
Take a few dollars from my pocket and use it.
I'll be back then.
Hey, Ga Young.
At a large company like that...
there is usually a large material warehouse.
Go in there and get some fabric for us.
Excuse me?
Yes, sir.
Yes, I know.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'll see you soon.
I'm in big trouble.
What do I do?
Ga Young.
Ga Young!
Ga Young!
Don't you think we can use the fabric those people threw away to make it?
Hello.
I couldn't say anything the other day because the Director was next to you.
But didn't I tell you enough to understand when we were back in America?
I told you not to come near the Director.
If you keep getting involved like this, I'm the one getting exhausted.
Do you think it's one or two things I have to go cleaning up after?
-I came here to work.
-That's how it all starts in the beginning!
You don't think that's how Miss Choi started?
!
That's how...!
Oh my...
Oh well...since...
it's already happened like this...
I'm asking you...
Please don't make things difficult for me.
Just end it with this, and don't date him.
You got that?
And...since all this is being done by Director Jung, be careful that you don't say anything useless to other people.
Yes.
The Director wants to see you for a moment...
so follow me.
Wait here for a moment.
Miss Lee Ga Young is here.
-Did you get the work station ready?
-Yes.
I've got everything ready.
Everything she needs from now on...
acquire them yourself and take care of it.
Ah yes.
I understand.
-And pay special attention to security.
-Yes, I understand.
Okay.
Tell her to come in.
Yes.
Hello.
Okay.
Work hard.
You can go.
I'll be going then.
Enjoy your breakfast.
Oh my...the work is under way.
Everyone needs to get it done quickly.
-What should I do with this part?
-Do whatever you feel is right.
-You want double or triple stitching here?
-Double.
You should know that.
You have to hurry it up, okay?
-We're late.
Hurry it up.
-Everyone hurry!
Will this do?
Oh...it's sexy.
-Bong Sook...
-But... are we going to a party or something?
So?
I'm not the best at writing things out, so I didn't get to express it all in the plan.
But to tell you simply...
I'm saying we should make a fashion brand which includes your name in it.
-Brand?
-Yes.
We start a fashion brand with your name, and start a world famous fashion kingdom.
Fashion kingdom?
But..you know there needs to be a king in a kingdom?
Kingdom?
Yes, that's right.
You're going to become the King in that fashion kingdom.
In a fashion show that's opened all over the world, you get your picture taken rubbing shoulders with leaders all over the world.
You can enjoy your parties in the best hotels around the world with all the leaders.
And at the best resorts around the world, you can party with all the hotties.
Chairman.
Do you like my plans?
You seem to understand the romance of it.
Thank you, Chairman.
So?
First...
I've prepared something as a gift to you.
Mademoiselle Bong!
In New York, where fashion reigns, she specialized in fashion for 10 years, and now she's joined hands with our Young-Young fashion, our fashion producer, Mademoiselle Bong.
Hello.
You can just call me Bong.
Bong?
Why don't you try it on?
This is our first product from our YGM company.
YGM?
Yes.
Yellow Great Mountain.
Hwang.
Tae.
San.
they're your initials.
Oh...yellow great?
Hwang Tae...
We can't just get rid of the brand.
No, no, no, no.
Do you know how much we spent on it?
I think the items will be great this time.
The launching is going to be much better and bigger than you've seen in New York.
So, just fax me the guest list soon, okay?
Yeah.
Let's give it a shot.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, what?
Team leader Choi An Na is here.
Tell her to come in.
Are you busy?
No, it's okay.
Sit down.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I'm sorry.
For saying thing like that.
No.
I'm the one who's sorry.
I thought about it carefully.
I think what you've said is right.
As I'm sure you already know...
I'm not that skilled.
You don't need to think that badly.
You said those things for our benefit...
I think I responded to it all too sensitively.
You can do that.
Where did you find a treasure like that?
They were nice.
It's a relief that you think that.
How they're perceived is all the same.
Then... you want to try working together with her?
Did you hire her as a designer?
-Not that.
-What then?
Just think of her as your personal assistant and use her.
You're sure I'm not the assistant?
We can't have that.
This is your collection.
I'm curious to see who it is.
Do you want to meet her?
What you said last night...
were you sincere?
What did I say?
About us moving in together.
Ah...that.
If I was sincere about it?
Should we move in together?
If you want it.
I thought the princess line I originally thought was too bold,
So make it pass through inside the breast line.
-And make this...
-Lee Ga Young.
Say hello.
This is Miss Lee Ga Young, and this is team leader, Choi An Na.
We've met before, right?
Yes.
Have you been well?
You've met before?
Yeah.
I saw her once in New York.
Really?
That's good then.
You don't need anything else?
Yes.
Report all your progress from now on to our team leader Choi An Na.
Since she's lacking in experience, you're going to have to teach her a lot.
Then...the two of you try to make a really awesome project together.
Of course, we should.
Okay, then...good luck.
Shall I take a look first?
Did you say your name is Lee Ga Young?
Yes.
-How old are you?
-I'm 21 years old.
You're bold for such a young thing.
Excuse me?
-Who's idea was it?
-What is?
Working in this method.
It was Director Jung's idea.
Are you still working for Kang Young Gul?
Yes.
Really?
Do a good job so Director Jung likes it.
I don't have to be here, right?
Lee Ga Young?
Ah...that girl that used to live with you?
I thought I heard that she went to New York to study?
Isn't she going to the same school as your daughter right now?
I guess you don't know at all.
Then I guess you don't know she went to see your son to beg about school problems either?
There was something like that?
That's why she barely got to get in school because of all the efforts from your son.
But ultimately, she didn't even get to attend the school for long, and she got kicked out of school because of the guy she was living with, and got deported back to Korea.
Why are you telling me that all of a sudden?
I didn't say anything to you until now because I was so humiliated...
But I thought it was so strange...
so I thought you should know.
What is it that I should know about?
Until recently...
she was living out of our shop.
So?
And your son came to see her.
To my shop directly himself.
I'm sure he had a reason to come see her.
I'm sure that's it.
But...he even brought her home himself at night?
Stop with that useless talk.
You need to listen to one of my requests.
What...?
In the past, he at least pretended to listen to what I told him... but now that he's older, he doesn't even listen to any threats.
My Jae Hyuk...what can I do to get him away from that wench?
-Look for some ways.
-Madame.
I've been telling you all this time.
What?
The way I see it, it's not Choi An Na that's the problem, but Lee Ga Young.
For some request like that, you called a busy person to come?
What's the point of giving her any information?
When she doesn't understand anything.
Because she's so dense like that...
she has no control of her husband.
-Hello.
-You...?
What are you doing here?
-I've come here to work.
-What?
Here to work?
Goodbye.
There's no problems with the building security.
Oh...how's your sample coming along?
The patterns are a little difficult, right?
But you have to make it work well.
Don't you think it's awesome even when you look at it?
Of course, she was a design student.
Anyways, make sure the people at the embroidery place keep their mouth shut.
I'll call you again later.
Is it you, Ga Young?
What brings you here, An Na?
Is this the Dongdaemun headquarters...
that you talked about the other time?
Yes...
I mean, yeah.
Sit down.
I'll get you a beverage.
Subtitles by DramaFever
I'm the crazy one expecting some humanity from a piece of trash like you.
You came because you missed me, right?
-Is it because of the love you've had?
-Excuse me?
-You're working under Kang Young Gul.
-Lee.
Ga.
Young!
This person is someone who has no one to lean on like me.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
!
I came here from fashion school.
Between the chairman and I...
who do you think is going to live longer?
Can you ignore the person who presented you the most precious time in your life?
If you want to know how I feel about the pain that you're feeling, you can call me at any time.
-=Episode 6=-
Have you ever been so devoid of hope that you wanted to die?
I have.
You!
What are you doing here?
-=Everlasting love, Anna.=-
Ah, right.
Everlasting love.
I got punched again?
Do you know what place this is?
How dare you just come in like that?
Hey, do you think I'm here to see you?
Get out!
You...
Anna is sleeping.
Lower you voice.
Get out now!
You don't have to tell me that.
I was leaving anyway.
I brought her home in one piece.
As a human being, you should at least offer me a drink.
This is my home.
Get lost!
I see.
Fine, I'll leave.
My pride is hurt, so forget about the drink.
Pretty leather stilettos.
As expected.
Hey, Gang Yeong Geol!
Tell Lee Ga Yeong to stop by my office tomorrow morning at 10.
Why?
None of your business.
Just get the hell out of here.
When Anna wakes up, let her know I'll give her a call before 10 tomorrow morning.
When did you get here?
We just started over recently.
Please don't do anything that could cause a misunderstanding.
What misunderstanding?
From any perspectives.
What do you mean?
Many eyes are watching us right now.
So, please be careful.
Why?
Did your father say something?
Did you have a chat with my father?
Why ask me?
What did he say?
He asked me if I was going to get married, and I said yes.
Can you go to work?
Why?
Have I said something wrong?
No, you were right.
I thought we could go to work together.
That's why I came.
Take your time and leave whenever you're ready.
I'm still hammered.
The girl yesterday was Anna?
You saw her?
Yes.
She's still very cool, isn't she?
We're the same age.
Why did she come to Dongdaemun?
Oh, that's because she was charmed by me.
What are you going to do about the factory?
What do you mean?
Aren't you going to pay off the debts?
Do you have to talk about factory now and kill my appetite?
Don't you have any plans?
How long do you plan to keep on going like this?
Of course I have a plan.
I have a plan.
What kind of plan?
Hey, I'm your boss.
I don't have to report everything to you.
I'm not eating.
You go ahead.
Jeong Jae Hyeok!
How was your talk with Jeong Jae Hyeok?
What talk?
Didn't you say you were trying to get an order from him?
But we haven't gotten into the details yet.
How do you expect to get an order without having a good plan?
This.
No.
Try this one on.
Hello.
Excuse me...
I'm here to see Jeong Jae Hyeok.
You are...?
My name is Lee Ga Yeong.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Come in.
Thank you.
Have a seat.
That outfit you're wearing right now, is it one of your own designs?
No, it's Chil Bok ajussi's.
Chil Bok ajussi?
Looks like Gang Yeong Geol is in a rush.
He sent his employee on time.
I'm very busy, so I won't beat around the bush.
I am only interested in your designs.
I don't give a damn about Gang Yeong Geol's factory.
Due to your lack of educational background, I am unable to employ you officially.
Our cooperation will take place behind the scenes.
I'm sure you already have some designs in your head.
Make a few samples here.
All the materials and equipment are free for you to use.
If you need anything else, feel free to make a request.
If you need manpower, we have highly skilled colorists, pattern makers, and seamstresses at your disposal.
Whether or not your designs are used, you will still get paid, so don't worry.
So, how much time do you need?
So, are you saying that you want to pay me off and then steal my designs?
Right now, I am giving you a chance.
I'm very grateful for this chance.
But I don't wish to handle my designs this way.
You have neither designs nor a factory right now, and yet you want us to treat you as a professional designer?
I think that's a bit shameless.
Did you learn all of that from Gang Yeong Geol?
Very well, I would really love to see how confident you people are.
Tell Gang Yeong Geol to fax me his bank account number and company ID.
I will.
Thank you!
He agreed?
Yes.
Hey, don't tell me that punk has a crush on you.
If he's not crazy, why would he give us money without seeing the designs first?
It's not like that.
He's paying us the design fee and sample fee in advance.
If they're approved, they will be sent to a garment factory and begin wholesale production.
You need a business license, right?
Yes.
Then, go and get one.
What name should we use?
How does Young Young Apparel sound?
Young Young Apparel?
Taking one character from both our names?
No, it's from Na Hon A's Young Young.
I am a fan of hers.
Sounds good, right?
Yes.
Did you see Anna?
Did you?
No, I didn't.
Yeah?
When is he going to give us the money?
I'm sorry for treating your female companion like that the other day.
I didn't expect it would go that far.
I was forced by others too.
You know right, in military training, even a good man can turn into a dog.
Yes, of course I know that.
Also, she is not my female companion.
Anyway, let's let bygones be bygones.
Let's start anew.
I'll see you again.
And please tell your female companion that we're sorry.
I said, she's not my female companion, boss.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
See you later.
See you!
Chil Bok?
Tell Ga Yeong to pack up and go to that Chinese Restaurant.
I'll buy her something to eat.
Okay.
Why are you people putting on so much makeup?
Like you were going to see your lover.
Look who's talking.
Why don't you look at your lips?
If a young man offers to buy us lunch, it's mandatory to doll up.
No matter how young the boss is, a man is still a man.
He is no ordinary man.
He is a good-looking man.
That's true.
Really good looking.
Although his relationships with women are quite complicated, if we judge only by his appearance, he is perfect.
Aigoo, he is well-built too.
But, how should we greet Ga Yeong when we see her?
Should we address her as Madam?
Madam.
Aigoo...
Madam!
So shallow!
Too shallow.
Aigoo...
My belly.
Aigoo, seriously...
Captain!
Look who's here.
Isn't that Boss Gang?
Boss Gang!
Boss Gang!
How come you only greeted the captain and left out the rest of us?
Aigoo... how could I?
I missed you all so much.
Aigoo.
We also missed you so much.
It must be hard on you.
What kind of life is this?
Your birth zodiac doesn't seem to do you any good.
But, what happened to your face?
Aigoo, such a handsome face.
Who did this to you?
Who else?
Must have been that bastard Hwang Tae San.
So, have you settled the problem with Boss Hwang?
Hey, why don't we sit down first?
To celebrate our new beginning, everything is on me.
Just order whatever you want to eat.
What happened to our stingy Boss Gang?
You've become so generous since that incident.
Bong Su!
Hey, you asshole!
Give me back my life!
What are you going to do about it?
What are you going to do about my life?
Who is this ajumma?
Because of you, I was deported from the US.
Is she crazy?
Of all places, why did you have to come to mine?
You turned us into their enemies.
It's all your fault!
Because I helped you!
Let go of you hands first!
Let go!
Aigoo, this ajumma...
She's quite strong.
Get away from me!
You bunch of shallow women.
What?
Shallow?
This bitch!
Aigoo, stop!
Seriously...
Although I stayed there illegally,
I got used to it after awhile.
I thought, I only needed to work harder for a short time, and everything would eventually be better.
Then, I met Ga Yeong, so I extended my stay.
All my hard-earned money was confiscated.
I became penniless.
Because of my age, I couldn't find any job here.
It became so tiring to live.
I thought of killing myself, but I chickened out.
I'm sorry.
I overreacted just now.
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
Boss Gang, is your factory somewhere near here?
Yes.
By any chance, are you hiring?
Although I didn't plan on hiring anybody for the time being, if you're willing to come and work with us, of course I'll be more than happy to accept.
If you put it like that, it would be rude of me to say no.
Let me put the skills I learned in New York to good use then.
Do you have any news about Ga Yeong?
Eonni!
Ga Yeong?
Omo...
Ga Yeong!
How am I supposed to demonstrate my skills in a place like this?
Look, instead of wandering around, why don't you go clean up over there?
This ajumma, really...
Bong Su,
where are you living right now?
Why?
If it's possible, can you take Ga Yeong to live with you?
I'm living at my friend's place.
If it's okay, can I move in here too?
No!
What?
What a nuisance.
Director, an express delivery for you.
Chil Bok?
That thing I talked to you about last time...
Yes.
Go ahead and do it.
In conclusion, we should go ahead with the modern style.
This is what I've prepared.
I'm not sure if you used up too much of your inspiration in New York.
It's such a pity.
It's not good enough.
Although it's not all bad, it gives people the feeling of monotony.
It's a bit too stubborn.
Of course, as artists we need to have some principles.
But ready-to-wear designers like us need to get in touch with the people.
Isn't that right, Director Jeong?
Yes.
Right?
How should I say it?
It feels like the potential is being suffocated under the burden and pressure.
It does sound like it when you put it like that.
Make some changes before the final evaluation.
Do you agree, Director Jeong?
Change it.
Meeting adjourned.
Miss Choe Anna, please come to my office.
Whose is it?
That's not important.
Aren't I the person in charge of this collection?
That's why I'm asking for your opinion.
But I can't know whose this is?
You'll find out when it's time to start working together.
It looks like you've made up your mind.
Why do you even bother to ask me then?
For the sake of protocol?
Isn't it a good thing to be able to compensate for our inadequacies?
Are you saying I'm inadequate?
Why are you being so sensitive?
It's for us.
No matter what, we have to succeed this time.
I didn't know you were so thoughtful about me.
I am so grateful to you.
What's your plan?
If you're not happy with it, then forget about it.
Don't you like it?
Do whatever you want.
Hello, it's me.
Go and check on Lee Ga Yeong's progress and then report back to me.
When was I ever troubled because of money?
Have you ever seen anyone who has been in jail and still manages to pay off his debts?
When it comes to paying off debts, I am quite good at it.
As long as we manage to finish the samples, it will not only be good for you, boss, but for both of us.
Our order is going to be huge.
So, if you could lend us some materials...
Boss, it's not that much.
It's not like we've only done business for one or two days.
Forget it, forget it!
Don't regret it in the future!
How long are we going to stay like this?
What do you mean, stay like this?
I feel bad getting paid.
Who on earth would use the money for fabric to settle debts?
You think the fabrics you picked out are regular ones?
It's all because you insist on using the best fabrics.
You really know how to pick.
If it's not that kind of fabric, it won't feel the same.
Whatever the reason may be, it's only for samples, so why do you need that kind of fabric?
Just use some cheap, regular fabric for samples.
It's just a sample so that people get an idea of it.
If it's not that kind of fabric, no matter how hard I work on it, the feeling will be different.
It's you who overdid it.
$150 to $200 for fabric?
Who is going to buy that?
If we can't come up with the samples, what's going to happen to our factory?
The expenses will be come out of your butt?
Boss, you're so vulgar.
What are you thinking about?
Why are you being like this?
Jeez...
We must first come up with the samples.
Why don't you go to that asshole Jeong Jae Hyeok and borrow some fabric?
We already got our advance.
We can't go there and ask for fabric too.
That's why you have to go and explain our situation and bring back some fabric.
That asshole will listen to you.
No, it's too embarrassing.
Why don't you go, boss?
I hate him and he hates me.
Miss Choi Anna is there, isn't she?
Fine!
Don't go, then.
Forget it!
Don't do the order.
Don't go!
We can't cancel the order.
We already accepted his money.
We have to fulfill the agreement.
What's the use of being the boss?
None of my employees are willing to help.
You think I have the ability to pull this off just because I'm the boss?
Turn in your resignation letter and let's each go our own way.
Can't we use the fabric that they threw away?
Use that fabric.
Can't we?
Forget it!
Forget it!
Don't do anything.
So disgusting!
Excuse me.
Director, what brings you to our humble place?
I thought that even though your factory is small, you would be able to finish the job.
If I hadn't come, it would have been a big problem.
Can a sample be produced in such an atmosphere?
Is it the atmosphere that makes the clothes?
People make the clothes.
What kind of people?
Those people outside who seem to have nothing better to do?
I think you are mistaken, Director.
Those people outside started in this industry as far back as 10 years old.
Artists, professionals...
To call them that is not an exaggeration.
Do you understand?
But why are you here?
Are you here to monitor us?
Have a drink.
Thank you.
Miss Lee Ga Yeong, can you finish the whole thing?
Yes.
I happen to think otherwise.
We're very grateful that you paid us in advance, but to stop by unannounced like this is quite inappropriate.
Miss Lee Ga Yeong, can you give us some privacy?
How about this?
Until the samples are finished, Lee Ga Yeong will be working at our office.
Are you trying to steal my most competent employee?
Only for a short while.
It's good for you too.
I think after settling your debts, you don't have any money left to buy fabric.
Or, we can forget the whole thing, and you can refund my money.
If I rent out my employee, you have to pay her 4 times her current salary plus all the benefits and bonus.
Sound good to you?
What are you doing here?
Have you had dinner?
I don't have any appetite.
Why don't we move in together?
It's such a waste of time coming and going like this.
I think my father has a good impression of you.
He's not a person who would normally say such a thing.
He said that you take your work really seriously.
He's looking forward to your performance.
Why are you smiling?
Even you don't expect anything of me.
Why would I care about what the Chairman expects of me?
Are you really going to be like this?
Do you know why I showed the designs to you?
To piss you off?
It's for us, so we can do better.
Did I say anything?
I know.
So that we can do better.
If you know it, then let go of your pride.
Since it's your project, you'll be responsible for it from start to finish.
So don't worry.
All right?
Yes.
Let me take a look.
Chairman.
Chairman!
What?
I'm going to work now.
Don't come back too late.
If I go there, what am I going to do about my lunch?
Hey, how should I know?
Why don't you ask them?
You are really strange.
Give me some money for lunch.
I have a few thousand in my pocket.
Just take it.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Ga Yeong!
At a large company like that, they normally have a large material warehouse also.
Do you think you can go in there and bring back some fabric for us?
Yes, Chairman?
Yes, I understand.
Yes, of course.
Yes, I will pay you a visit for sure.
Something big happened.
What am I supposed to do?
Ga Yeong, Ga Yeong!
Can't we use the fabric that they threw away?
Use that fabric.
Hello.
Last time I didn't say anything because the director was there.
I believe I made it really clear to you when we were in the US.
Don't ever show up in front of our director.
However, you two keep getting involved in one way or another.
I'll be the one in deep trouble.
There will be more than just one or two things for me to clean up after this!
I came because of work.
That's how it all starts!
It was like that with Miss Choi too!
Even then I told her...
Anyway, things have already gotten to this point.
Please don't create any more headaches for me.
Just end it right here, right now.
Do not get involved with him.
Do you understand?
Director Jeong is the person in charge here.
Be careful not to draw any unwanted attention.
Okay.
The Director wants to see you.
Follow me, please.
Wait here.
Lee Ga Yeong is here.
All the preparations are complete?
Yes, sir.
I've got everything ready.
From now on, everything she needs for her work, you see to it and take care of it personally.
Yes.
Understood.
Pay special attention to trade information security.
Yes.
Understood.
Okay, send her over.
Hello.
Okay.
Work hard.
Go ahead.
I'll start on my work then.
Please enjoy your meal.
Too slow.
Let's move faster people, otherwise we'll fall behind schedule.
What do we do with the double stitches?
Just separate them.
Is this one double or triple stitched?
Do as you see fit.
I will.
Captain, you suck lately.
- We're running out of time.
Hurry up!
- Work faster!
How is it?
Wow!
Very sexy, Bong Su!
But, are we going to a party?
So?
I am not really good at putting a proposal into writing.
So, I may not have expressed my ideas clearly.
To put it simply,
I want to create a fashion brand using your name.
Brand?
Yes.
Using your name as our brand to establish a global fashion kingdom.
Fashion kingdom?
In this kingdom there will be a king.
A king?
Yes, that's right.
You will be the king of that fashion kingdom.
You can have your pictures taken with those international models in fashion shows held around the world.
You will hang out with famous people from around the world at the fanciest hotels.
At the best resorts around the world, you can have a good time with tons of beautiful women.
Chairman, what do you think of my proposal?
President Gang, you really do understand what romance is all about.
Thank you, President.
So?
First of all, in order to express my remorse I have something for you.
Mademoiselle Bong!
In New York, the place where fashion was born, she has been focusing on individual design for a decade and has now joined forces with our Young Young Apparel.
She is our company's vice chief designer, Mademoiselle Bong.
Hello.
Please call me Bong.
Bong?
Try this on.
It's the first product of YGM.
YGM?
Yes.
It's the initials of Hwang Tae San.
Oh, Yellow Great...
Hwang Tae...
We can't just get rid of the brand.
No, no, no, no...
Do you know how much we spent on it?
I think the items will be great this time.
The launching is going to be much better and bigger than it was in New York.
So, just fax me the guest list soon, okay?
Yeah.
Let's give it a shot.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Yes?
What?
Team Leader Choi is here.
Ask her to come in.
Busy?
No, it's okay.
Have a seat.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I am sorry for saying those things to you.
No, it's me who should apologize.
I gave it some thought, and I think you're right.
You know that I don't have that kind of skill.
Don't think like that.
It's all for us to do well.
Maybe my reaction was a bit too sensitive.
Maybe.
Where did you find a treasure like that?
It's pretty good.
It's great if you can look at it that way.
Great minds think alike.
Do you want her to work under you?
Have you hired her as a designer?
Not exactly.
- Then...
- Just treat her as your personal assistant.
I'm not the assistant?
Of course not.
It's your collection.
Who is it?
I'm really curious.
Shall we go see?
Were you serious yesterday?
About what?
About moving in together.
Oh, that...
What if I was serious?
Should we?
As long as you don't mind.
It has to feel like a princess skirt.
Make some wrinkles around the chest area.
Like this.
Lee Ga Yeong.
Say hello.
This is Lee Ga Yeong.
This is design team leader Choi Anna.
We have met before, haven't we?
Yes.
Hello.
Former acquaintances?
Yes.
We met in New York.
I see.
That's great.
You don't need anything else?
No.
In the future, report directly to Team Leader Choi Anna on all matters.
In the meantime, due to her inexperience, please take care of her.
Then, the two of you create a masterpiece together.
Of course.
Good!
Let's work hard.
Let's start by looking at the template.
Your name is Lee Ga Yeong, isn't it?
Yes.
How old are you?
21 years old.
- So young, yet so bold.
- Huh?
Whose idea was this?
What?
Whose idea was it to make this?
It was Director Jeong's idea.
Are you still working for Gang Yeong Geol?
Yes.
Okay.
Do it until Director Jeong is satisfied.
I don't need to be here, do I?
Lee Ga Yeong?
Oh, that kid who used to live at your place?
I heard she went to school in America.
Isn't she going to the same school as your daughter?
You didn't know?
She wasn't accepted and went to beg your son for help.
You had no idea?
Such a thing happened?
So, you son helped her and pulled some strings.
She got readmitted into the school.
But after attending for only a few days, the school expelled her because she was living with a criminal.
She was deported back to South Korea.
This matter regarding the child, why tell me now?
During that period of time, I felt so ashamed, so I couldn't bring myself to talk about it.
But I kept feeling that something just doesn't add up, so I thought it would be best if you knew.
What should I know?
She stayed at our boutique until recently.
So?
You son came over and looked for her.
He came in person to our boutique.
He probably had some business to take care of.
I thought so too.
But he even dropped her off himself, one evening, so...
Enough of this useless talk.
I need a favor from you.
What is it?
Before, he at least pretended to listen to what I said.
But now that he's more mature, regular threats just don't work on him anymore.
Our Jae Hyeok...
What should I do to make him break up with that woman?
Help me find a way.
Madam, didn't you listen to what I just said?
What?
According to my intuition, it's definitely not Choi Anna, but Lee Ga Yeong.
Just for a small favor like this, she has to summon me?
What's the point of giving her information?
She doesn't understand it anyway.
So stupid!
No wonder her husband likes to go out looking for other women.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I was transferred to work here.
What?
Work here?
Goodbye.
Nothing to report.
How is it going with the samples?
That pattern is a bit complicated, right?
Still, it has to be done nicely.
Don't you think it looks great?
Of course, it was 4 years of hard work.
Tell those people in embroidery to keep this confidential...
I'll call you back later.
Ga Yeong, is that you?
What brought you here, Miss Anna?
This is the Dongdaemun headquarters that you mentioned before?
Yes, that...
Please sit.
I'll get you something to drink.
-=Next Episode Preview=-
A piece of trash like you...
To expect something human out of you, I must have been crazy.
You came because you missed me?
Someone you like has appeared?
Still working for Gang Yeong Geol?
Lee Ga Yeong!
Apart for me, that person has no one else to turn to.
Why are you here?
Why?
Young Young Apparel.
Between the chairman and I, who will live longer?
How can I ignore a person who has given me the most in my life?
Anything will do.
You want to see the good side of me?
Comeanytime.
THE BOMBING A HATECRIME AGAINST HUBOTS
- Aren't you going to work?
- Well, yes...
Don't you sleep?
When I woke up in the night, you were up.
I was watching TV.
All night?
No, I turned in later, on the couch.
I didn't sleep either, and the telly was on all night.
- Yes, you slept.
- I did?
- I tucked you in.
- You did?
- You slept very well.
- Okay.
When I woke up, the bathroom was busy.
Until now.
I had to use the garden.
- I was using it.
- For hours?
- I just left my "husband".
- Yes, I know...
But...
- What has that got to do with this?
- Maybe you worry about the bombing.
I think about it alot.
And Kevin.
I'm not really myself.
And it's just the same for me.
REAL HUMANS
Shit!
Mange.
(Nick for Magnus)
Are you horny?
She looks fucking horny.
You want to cuddle?
Hold her.
Give us some kiss lips.
- Come on, go for it.
Do it yourself.
- Feel her breast.
What the fuck was that?
Fag!
Hold it!
Rick?
We've been getting by on my savings for awhile.
But now I have to start working.
And I've got a job!
Pilar got me a position at her gym.
- Honey, aren't you happy?
- Yes...
For what?
- I've got a job.
- Yes...
Really.
Maybe you can come with me to work.
I can be by myself.
At home.
- What would you do?
- Go to the mall and look.
- You go there for a purpose.
- Charge in the slot charger?
I think you should come to the gym with me.
Bo often does it with Pilar.
How nice.
We're out of milk.
I'll go and buy some.
Fuck, he's doing it!
- Stop it.
- Come on!
- Take it easy!
Guys, let's split.
Come on, let's go!
Anita...
Hello, Tobias.
Hello.
My name is Inger Engman, I will be your defense attorney.
- Everything we say is confidential.
- We're being monitored.
Yes, I suppose we are.
You specifically requested me.
It's never happened to me before, so I'm a bit curious.
Well, that's your business.
You are accused of two murders.
They have your fingerprints on the scene and in the escape vehicle.
That's pretty damaging technical evidence in a trial.
You risk a conviction.
What we're dealing with is very serious, so it would be nice if you spoke up.
I can't speak as long as we're being monitored.
They can tape the inquiry, but first, I need to talk to you.
Just you and me.
Okay.
I'll see...
I'll see what I can do.
Give me your old clothes.
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Kevin.
Just so you know, if you tell anyone about today, you're dead.
Hello?
Hello?
- Is Anita here?
- Yes.
She was supposed to pick Sofia up at the day-care.
Something has happened.
Sofia, why don't you go and unpack your bag?
Well, what?
I came back from school and someone must have been on her, so I helped...
- "Been on her"?
- I don't know.
She's in one piece.
- Why didn't you call me?
- Didn't think...
No harm done, just...
- Just?
- Nothing...
- Anita, how are you?
- I'm fine.
What happened today?
Four boys prevented me from picking Sofia up.
And I'm sorry about that.
What did they do?
They prevented me from getting Sofia.
I think it was a prank.
- Can I talk to Tobbe in private?
- Of course.
"A prank"?
Did you see what happened?
I saw some guys running, then I found Anita, but there are those that deride hubots.
- This is a police matter.
- But nothing happened.
- You saw who it was?
- Some young punks.
- And she's not broken?
- No.
- I will report this.
- Daddy!
Coming!
- She's okay, what will the police do?
- We'll see.
Take the groceries, please.
I guess I'm here to build a confidence, to make him cooperate.
This falls under exemption provisions.
Even so, he has the right to know if he's being monitored.
The situation is both special and very serious.
He's charged with two murders and the bombing.
- And I'd say the evidence are poor.
- Oh?
You have his dentals, fingerprints, DNA, every scar has been photographed.
But he has a mark, a tattoo on his arm.
And that's not even registered in his description.
You've been given what's essential to the criminal investigation.
I'm not stupid.
I know there's something you're not telling me.
If you don't want to cooperate, just say so.
He chose me as his counsel, so now I expect you to let me know when I can talk to him without being monitored.
He specifically requested her.
He must have some reason.
Oh, can I have the scraps?
I don't have any money.
- Where's your owner?
- I don't have an owner.
Do you want to come to the bathroom with me?
I don't date hubots...
Did he say that, Pilar?
Wait...
So it's here?
- I was about to ask you to buy some.
- Oh...
- Have you been outside?
- No...
- Oh.
I thought...
Oh, well...
- It's okay.
You were saying?
Exactly...
- Right...
- If I had any say in it...
- Because of my attitude towards hubots?
- No, I fought for you, but there's new management.
We're not profitable.
The times are rough, so we do as everyone else, or we all go.
- And Jorge?
- Jorge.
This is the first measure, and there may be more.
Answer the question, will you keep Jorge?
You have both been let go.
But Jorge will be rehired.
- I've been here 7 years longer than him.
- You get 12 months severance pay.
- What the fuck...
- And that's generous, Roger.
But it's dependent on the condition that you work a few weeks more, and let -
- Iago, here, work beside you, so he'll learn your tasks.
Hello, Roger.
Is there a purpose to walk this slow?
- Walk as you please, this is my pace.
- So it's an individual choice?
Maybe, for me...
Tell me the purpose of what you're doing.
I collect the order sheets and check that everything's ticked off by the packers.
May I try?
No, I want to take them from the holder, like you did.
Go ahead.
There's a tick missing here, didn't you see that?
Of course I did.
- What do you do if an item isn't ticked?
- Guess...
I check the stock balance, the packer may have made a mistake.
Then I notify the packer so it won't happen again.
- That's right.
- Where are we going now?
- I'm going for a coffee, you stay here.
Stand right there, when I get back.
- What's the purpose of...
- The purpose is that I said so.
After breakfast we'll go for a 30 minute walk, then you rest an hour.
A light lunch, then another short walk.
Let it ring, Lennart.
Lennart, no!
- Hello?
- Guess who it is.
Solveig.
Lennart, deux points.
What would you say about having dinner with me tonight?
Yes...
Your place or mine, handsome?
Eh, maybe...
- At your place, gorgeous.
- No...
My place is a mess, can we be at your place?
- Yes, but...
- You know what?
Why don't we shop and make dinner, it was ages ago I did that.
- I have to run.
Kiss.
- Kiss?
Kiss!
- Roger.
- Mm.
Played any golf?
- No...
- It's so obsessive.
Dammit...
We were supposed to work 20 minutes ago.
- Didn't I tell you to wait?
- The coffee break is five minutes.
So?
If you won't come and continue to teach me your job, I will let Maria know.
I'm a little late...
- ...and you will tell Maria?
- That's the procedure.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Your kind end up disliked, does that bother you?
Maria likes me.
Can I try?
- Enough talking, it's time to work.
- You see the spot up there?
- I see many spots.
- Look at the big one up there.
How does Maria like you now, huh?
How does she like you now?
Fucking puppet!
Hell, Roger!
What are you doing?
How does she like you now?
Well...
I should report this to the police.
I take a personal risk if I don't.
But if you leave, and never show up here again, I won't.
Right...
I hope you work on your issues, the world isn't against you, Roger.
It's you, who's against the world.
I'm sure you'll understand, there will be no severance pay.
No...
- Are you done?
- We're done now.
I'm looking for ketchup.
Mathilda, honey!
?
- ...round the corner.
- Why are you here?
- We have to talk.
- The mark on Anita's arm.
- The one I made up and lied about?
You didn't tell dad or anyone else?
No.
Good.
Don't.
You were right.
Anita isn't just any hubot.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. yet.
But before I know more, don't talk to anyone about this.
Okay.
Two at a time.
He may get suspicious if fuses pop.
- Where is he?
- At work.
- When will he be back?
- Varies from day to day.
- How do you connect?
- He's attracted to me, he thinks I'm different.
- If I force it, I may push him away.
- Do you want me to take over?
- You're joking?
- No.
To change object now could be confusing.
Okay.
If there were two of us?
Wouldn't that speed up the process?
No.
Where is Leo?
Arrested.
- We won't get to him without risk.
- Isn't it a risk by not acting now?
They know that a dead Leo Eischer is of no use to them.
How are you?
I think it's because of Flash.
- Bea?
Bea?
Bea?
Bea!
?
- Don't go down there, it's a mess.
- Yes... ugh...
I'll clean it up, until I do, I keep out of there.
How was work today?
- I quit.
- What?
I quit.
I finally did something about it, and quit that fucking hubot farm.
I'll take that.
Now I'll stay at home.
Feels great.
Spend time with you.
I'll fix the cellar too.
Pull her pants down, wimp.
Come on, you won't do anything
Shit, he's doing it!
But honey, she's in one piece.
I don't know if we should call the police.
Absolutely not.
From now on, she doesn't leave the house.
If we can't let her outside, there's a problem big enough to call the police.
No...
Oh?
And why not?
I don't want that.
Maybe this isn't just about what you want...
I can't explain it, please just trust me, the police will not be involved in this.
- You have to accept that, I'm sorry.
- Right...
- Is Tobbe home?
- Yes, in his room.
It's mom.
Yes...
I'll take care of it, okay?
You're such a pain...
It's Tobbe, say your piece after the beep.
- Inger, if this is to work...
- Wait, wait...
Hey, Tobias, It's mom.
Can you call me when you get this, we have to talk.
Inger, come and watch this.
I'm on my way home now.
I have eaten.
Yes, whatever, bye.
From Anita!
Can I have that coin?
Can I have your coin?
I need food.
Here you go.
- Hey, what's up?
What's the money for?
The slot charger.
Let's see how much more you need.
Where's your owner?
In the store.
Hell, you can have power for free in my car.
And maybe some new clothes?
Good, come on.
It's cool.
Here, the red one.
This one?
That's junk.
No, this one.
That's good stuff.
There, Lennart.
Head for the vegetables!
What's this?
Why are you coming?
You, wait here!
- You must be allowed to sample.
- Are you sure?
Try it!
Hey, wait up!
Let me go!
Tobbe?
Come here.
- What?
I have homework.
- Mom and I saw a video on your computer.
What the hell!
Cameras rolling, do it again with a bit more feel.
Stop it, Hans.
It's not funny.
- The computer was on and the page up.
Tobias, this is some of the worst things I've seen.
How can you say it was a prank by some young guys?
It was before I saw the clip.
How did you even know there was a clip?
- This is just getting more weird.
You're coming down on me for this?
Open and I'll tell you something fun, Kev.
I've got a job, honey!
Can I come in?
Kev?
- What has happened?
- Nothing.
You're all banged up.
Let's see if I got this...
You heard Anita's voice, you thought it was young guys, but you didn't see them.
And you hid Anita's clothes because you thought we'd get mad about that.
Yes.
What have you been up to now?
Before you got home.
I took a walk.
Who did it?
You have to tell me.
You've been assaulted.
We have to call the police.
Shit, if you go on like this, I'll never tell.
I don't want you to call the police, okay?
But what has...
It was just someone, I don't know who.
A fucking madman.
- Wait, wait...
- We're not calling the police?
They won't do anything anyway.
Why don't you want me to call the police, Kevin?
What can they do now?
I don't want a fucking hearing.
What do you say?
I don't know...
I'm calling the police.
It was Kevin.
Therese's Kevin?
Say what you want, I'm calling the police now.
Okay, okay!
It was Tobbe, our old neighbor.
Inger's Tobbe?
Get out!
Get out, and inside!
Hurry up, you bastard!
This shit made her slow and useless.
No more of that!
And you, do you have to look as stupid as you are?
Huh?
Why do I do this?
Why do I take care of you?
I'm so fucking nice.
So fucking nice, I deserve prison.
I'm sorry, Silas.
You're sloppy and don't give a shit about what I've tought you.
- What have I tought you?
You.
- Do not leave the store together.
That's right!
Can you get that into your fucking Windows brains?
Never be seen in a group.
Never!
You can see a idiot here, another idiot there, but three of them together...
Fuck!
Hello?
Kindly open.
My God, it's been 8 years since she passed. 8 years.
It's something like that for me too.
Time rushes by, when you're alone.
Every day is like the next.
It rushes by when you're having fun too.
No, it moves even slower...
Have you had that machine as company since you were widowed.
No, she...
It's new.
I had another one before that.
But, he...
- Tell me.
- He broke.
I'm sorry.
It's probably the vine.
Now let's see!
What Solveig has in her bag.
Tonight, I think we deserve to get a little drunk, you and I.
I don't know...
Hey...
Now we'll see what she's made of, that, whatshername.
- Vera.
- Vera?
Vera, come!
- I can do that.
- No, we'll put her to work.
Yes?
Open.
There.
- Thank you, you can go.
- No, no, no.
Pour.
Enjoy.
Only me?
Pour for us both.
You shouldn't drink more vine, Lennart.
It's not good for you.
Shut up and pour.
Do as I say.
Pour it, Vera.
There...
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Go.
- Why don't you get rid of that bitch?
- She means well.
Sometimes you forget that they're machines.
Cheers!
Cheers.
For the humans.
Let's try again.
What's your name?
Okay.
Your name!
Hey, buddy.
Come.
Soon finished.
Oh.
- What are you doing?
- I liberate her, so she can be one of you.
You think it's scary?
It'll be over soon.
- You feel better now?
- It feels good.
The recycling station.
Haven't I told about it?
Not for the new ones.
Do you know what it is to die?
You get buried.
You disappear.
You no longer exist.
Humans get buried.
But you end up at the recycling station.
That's where Kyra is now.
They have cut out her eyes, cut her body up and taken the battery out.
Opened her skull and removed the brain.
Skinned her, melted it to a pulp.
Drained her of plasma.
She'll be new hubots now.
Without any memory of who they came from.
Wait, wait.
Know this.
One day you won't be around anymore.
You will disappear.
And become new hobots.
- Only if we get caught.
- There will be new models.
You get...
You get old, broken, worthless and no one will want you.
But me.
I'm not like that.
As long as you behave and do as you're told, you get to stay here.
Come on.
He's in love?
In love, not just some...
He's in love.
- So this has been your little secret.
- What was I to do?
He was ashamed.
- He didn't want anyone to find out.
- And he ends up assaulting Kevin.
Not that Kevin is any choir boy...
Should we get rid of her?
Anita?
I think this hubot is more trouble than help right now.
It's a she.
I suggest we sell her.
Anita.
Okay, because she was exploited, she's the problem.
My God, hubots are machines and we've exploited machines for centuries.
Sorry, I heard how that came out, but she's not human.
We're a kind of machine, too.
We marry them, we have sex with them.
We fall in love with them.
- What's the difference?
- We have a soul, a heart and emotions.
Anita was almost raped by a gang of kids today.
God, I'm tired of this.
We copy ourselves and dehumanize them, so that we can exploit them.
Regardless, hubots won't go away, we must learn to live with them.
That's what I'm saying.
I don't want to get rid of them, or Anita.
Just that they should be treated the same.
I can't listen to this anymore.
Welcome back.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Sorry.
- Hey, you...
- Yes.
Did we do it?
I don't know...
What's the time?
10.
What?
God...
Where did I put my clothes?
Get out!
Out!
You have a time to keep?
Yes...
The dog.
My little Nisse is all alone.
Goodbye.
Lover boy.
You have my number.
Call me.
Where's my bag....
I threw it away.
Your number!
Solveig!
Wait!
Egg and bacon, strong coffee?
Could you two help me with a bench press over here?
Well, guys...
Take the cap off, Kev.
- We think you both behaved badly.
- Yes.
Really badly...
Shake hands and say you're sorry.
Stand up, Kev!
Sorry that I hit you... so much.
Kevin!
Well, sorry if I... borrowed your... thing.
Do you know her name?
- No...
- Anita.
Okay.
- A little worse than "borrow", I think.
- We're going to court now?
You don't have to be best buddies, but try to be decent to one another.
Yes.
Kev!
I said I was sorry.
I don't think we get much further here.
I'm glad we got to see each other.
Kevin's 3 here.
At the fair.
He won that.
He was always lucky that way.
- You're bored?
- No.
Let me see.
- Is that you?
- Yes.
Cute.
This is Kevin's soccer team.
He was good at it.
I was supporting coach.
Always there for them.
This is...
I'm sorry.
- Never done this with anyone before.
- Done what?
Can't you see that I'm crying?
I've never done it with someone before.
What's the worst that happened to you?
- I don't know.
- That's okay.
You don't have to know stuff all the time.
I wish you'd met my mother, but she died five years ago.
- Dad died when I was 15.
- That's sad.
- Are yours alive?
- I don't have any.
- No parents?
- No.
- You're an orphan?
- Yes.
- Orphanage?
- No.
Some day when I really trust you, I will tell you.
- You can trust me.
- Some other day.
Okay.
I don't have a job, and the next paycheck will be my last.
But I'm not sad.
Not even worried.
- Do you know why that is?
- No.
- You don't?
- No.
- Not even a hunch?
- No.
Because you're here.
You're here.
That's the way it is.
Please hold for a second.
Excuse me, I have a meeting with a client and I'm running a bit late.
The case is closed.
- Excuse me?
- The case was closed today.
It's not closed, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry, you will not be admitted, there's no appointment and the case is closed.
- Crap game...
- I agree.
Nothing to write home about.
Ove!
- See you.
- Yeah, bye.
- What's happening?
- With?
My client.
Should have told you.
He's in observation.
- The case is closed?
- I'm afraid so.
- It can't be closed.
- Get in the car.
Well?
He may be put to death, in order to do an autopsy.
They can't do this.
You're sworn to secrecy.
This is what will happen.
And the murder investigation?
The victim's next of kin?
- People have the right to know!
- Not this time.
The investigation is ongoing, just without a suspect anymore.
- When will they murder him?
- In that case, tomorrow morning.
I will not let this go.
If they kill him, I will cause a racket!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry if I went ballistic the other day.
It's cool.
Is Bea here?
Yes.
Great.
Great that you two...
Really.
Well, I won't bother you...
Just wanted... to return your keys.
I left a few things in the basement.
It was left when I made the bomb.
Is it okay, if I... get it?
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.
REAL HUMANS
THE BOMBING A HATECRIME AGAINST HUBOTS
- Aren't you going to work?
- Well, yes...
Don't you sleep?
When I woke up in the night, you were up.
I was watching TV.
All night?
No, I turned in later, on the couch.
I didn't sleep either, and the telly was on all night.
- Yes, you slept.
- I did?
- I tucked you in.
- You did?
- You slept very well.
- Okay.
When I woke up, the bathroom was busy.
Until now.
I had to use the garden.
- I was using it.
- For hours?
- I just left my "husband".
- Yes, I know...
But...
- What has that got to do with this?
- Maybe you worry about the bombing.
I think about it alot.
And Kevin.
I'm not really myself.
And it's just the same for me.
REAL HUMANS
Shit!
Mange.
(Nick for Magnus)
Are you horny?
She looks fucking horny.
You want to cuddle?
Hold her.
Give us some kiss lips.
- Come on, go for it.
Do it yourself.
- Feel her breast.
What the fuck was that?
Fag!
Hold it!
Rick?
We've been getting by on my savings for awhile.
But now I have to start working.
And I've got a job!
Pilar got me a position at her gym.
- Honey, aren't you happy?
- Yes...
For what?
- I've got a job.
- Yes...
Really.
Maybe you can come with me to work.
I can be by myself.
At home.
- What would you do?
- Go to the mall and look.
- You go there for a purpose.
- Charge in the slot charger?
I think you should come to the gym with me.
Bo often does it with Pilar.
How nice.
We're out of milk.
I'll go and buy some.
Well, do something.
You too.
Do something, then!
Fucking wimp!
Fuck, he's doing it!
- Stop it.
- Come on!
- Take it easy!
Guys, let's split.
Come on, let's go!
Anita...
Hello, Tobias.
Hello.
My name is Inger Engman, I will be your defense attorney.
- Everything we say is confidential.
- We're being monitored.
Yes, I suppose we are.
You specifically requested me.
It's never happened to me before, so I'm a bit curious.
Well, that's your business.
You are accused of two murders.
They have your fingerprints on the scene and in the escape vehicle.
That's pretty damaging technical evidence in a trial.
You risk a conviction.
What we're dealing with is very serious, so it would be nice if you spoke up.
I can't speak as long as we're being monitored.
They can tape the inquiry, but first, I need to talk to you.
Just you and me.
Okay.
I'll see...
I'll see what I can do.
Give me your old clothes.
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Kevin.
Just so you know, if you tell anyone about today, you're dead.
Hello?
Hello?
- Is Anita here?
- Yes.
She was supposed to pick Sofia up at the day-care.
Something has happened.
Sofia, why don't you go and unpack your bag?
Well, what?
I came back from school and someone must have been on her, so I helped...
- "Been on her"?
- I don't know.
She's in one piece.
- Why didn't you call me?
- Didn't think...
No harm done, just...
- Just?
- Nothing...
- Anita, how are you?
- I'm fine.
What happened today?
Four boys prevented me from picking Sofia up.
And I'm sorry about that.
What did they do?
They prevented me from getting Sofia.
I think it was a prank.
- Can I talk to Tobbe in private?
- Of course.
"A prank"?
Did you see what happened?
I saw some guys running, then I found Anita, but there are those that deride hubots.
- This is a police matter.
- But nothing happened.
- You saw who it was?
- Some young punks.
- And she's not broken?
- No.
- I will report this.
- Daddy!
Coming!
- She's okay, what will the police do?
- We'll see.
Take the groceries, please.
I guess I'm here to build a confidence, to make him cooperate.
This falls under exemption provisions.
Even so, he has the right to know if he's being monitored.
The situation is both special and very serious.
He's charged with two murders and the bombing.
- And I'd say the evidence are poor.
- Oh?
You have his dentals, fingerprints, DNA, every scar has been photographed.
But he has a mark, a tattoo on his arm.
And that's not even registered in his description.
You've been given what's essential to the criminal investigation.
I'm not stupid.
I know there's something you're not telling me.
If you don't want to cooperate, just say so.
He chose me as his counsel, so now I expect you to let me know when I can talk to him without being monitored.
He specifically requested her.
He must have some reason.
Oh, can I have the scraps?
I don't have any money.
- Where's your owner?
- I don't have an owner.
Do you want to come to the bathroom with me?
I don't date hubots...
Did he say that, Pilar?
Wait...
So it's here?
- I was about to ask you to buy some.
- Oh...
- Have you been outside?
- No...
- Oh.
I thought...
Oh, well...
- It's okay.
You were saying?
Exactly...
- Right...
- If I had any say in it...
- Because of my attitude towards hubots?
- No, I fought for you, but there's new management.
We're not profitable.
The times are rough, so we do as everyone else, or we all go.
- And Jorge?
- Jorge.
This is the first measure, and there may be more.
Answer the question, will you keep Jorge?
You have both been let go.
But Jorge will be rehired.
- I've been here 7 years longer than him.
- You get 12 months severance pay.
- What the fuck...
- And that's generous, Roger.
But it's dependent on the condition that you work a few weeks more, and let -
- Iago, here, work beside you, so he'll learn your tasks.
Hello, Roger.
Is there a purpose to walk this slow?
- Walk as you please, this is my pace.
- So it's an individual choice?
Maybe, for me...
Tell me the purpose of what you're doing.
I collect the order sheets and check that everything's ticked off by the packers.
May I try?
No, I want to take them from the holder, like you did.
Go ahead.
There's a tick missing here, didn't you see that?
Of course I did.
- What do you do if an item isn't ticked?
- Guess...
I check the stock balance, the packer may have made a mistake.
Then I notify the packer so it won't happen again.
- That's right.
- Where are we going now?
- I'm going for a coffee, you stay here.
Stand right there, when I get back.
- What's the purpose of...
- The purpose is that I said so.
After breakfast we'll go for a 30 minute walk, then you rest an hour.
A light lunch, then another short walk.
Let it ring, Lennart.
Lennart, no!
- Hello?
- Guess who it is.
Solveig.
Lennart, deux points.
What would you say about having dinner with me tonight?
Yes...
Your place or mine, handsome?
Eh, maybe...
- At your place, gorgeous.
- No...
My place is a mess, can we be at your place?
- Yes, but...
- You know what?
Why don't we shop and make dinner, it was ages ago I did that.
- I have to run.
Kiss.
- Kiss?
Kiss!
- Roger.
- Mm.
Played any golf?
- No...
- It's so obsessive.
Dammit...
We were supposed to work 20 minutes ago.
- Didn't I tell you to wait?
- The coffee break is five minutes.
So?
If you won't come and continue to teach me your job, I will let Maria know.
I'm a little late...
- ...and you will tell Maria?
- That's the procedure.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Your kind end up disliked, does that bother you?
Maria likes me.
Can I try?
- Enough talking, it's time to work.
- You see the spot up there?
- I see many spots.
- Look at the big one up there.
How does Maria like you now, huh?
How does she like you now?
Fucking puppet!
Hell, Roger!
What are you doing?
How does she like you now?
Well...
I should report this to the police.
I take a personal risk if I don't.
But if you leave, and never show up here again, I won't.
Right...
I hope you work on your issues, the world isn't against you, Roger.
It's you, who's against the world.
I'm sure you'll understand, there will be no severance pay.
No...
- Are you done?
- We're done now.
I'm looking for ketchup.
Mathilda, honey!
?
- ...round the corner.
- Why are you here?
- We have to talk.
- The mark on Anita's arm.
- The one I made up and lied about?
You didn't tell dad or anyone else?
No.
Good.
Don't.
You were right.
Anita isn't just any hubot.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. yet.
But before I know more, don't talk to anyone about this.
Okay.
Two at a time.
He may get suspicious if fuses pop.
- Where is he?
- At work.
- When will he be back?
- Varies from day to day.
- How do you connect?
- He's attracted to me, he thinks I'm different.
- If I force it, I may push him away.
- Do you want me to take over?
- You're joking?
- No.
To change object now could be confusing.
Okay.
If there were two of us?
Wouldn't that speed up the process?
No.
Where is Leo?
Arrested.
- We won't get to him without risk.
- Isn't it a risk by not acting now?
They know that a dead Leo Eischer is of no use to them.
How are you?
I think it's because of Flash.
- Bea?
Bea?
Bea?
Bea!
?
- Don't go down there, it's a mess.
- Yes... ugh...
I'll clean it up, until I do, I keep out of there.
How was work today?
- I quit.
- What?
I quit.
I finally did something about it, and quit that fucking hubot farm.
I'll take that.
Now I'll stay at home.
Feels great.
Spend time with you.
I'll fix the cellar too.
Pull her pants down, wimp.
Come on, you won't do anything
Shit, he's doing it!
But honey, she's in one piece.
I don't know if we should call the police.
Absolutely not.
From now on, she doesn't leave the house.
If we can't let her outside, there's a problem big enough to call the police.
No...
Oh?
And why not?
I don't want that.
Maybe this isn't just about what you want...
I can't explain it, please just trust me, the police will not be involved in this.
- You have to accept that, I'm sorry.
- Right...
- Is Tobbe home?
- Yes, in his room.
It's mom.
Yes...
I'll take care of it, okay?
You're such a pain...
It's Tobbe, say your piece after the beep.
- Inger, if this is to work...
- Wait, wait...
Hey, Tobias, It's mom.
Can you call me when you get this, we have to talk.
Inger, come and watch this.
I'm on my way home now.
I have eaten.
Yes, whatever, bye.
From Anita!
Can I have that coin?
Can I have your coin?
I need food.
Here you go.
- Hey, what's up?
What's the money for?
The slot charger.
Let's see how much more you need.
Where's your owner?
In the store.
Hell, you can have power for free in my car.
And maybe some new clothes?
Good, come on.
It's cool.
Here, the red one.
This one?
That's junk.
No, this one.
That's good stuff.
There, Lennart.
Head for the vegetables!
What's this?
Why are you coming?
You, wait here!
- You must be allowed to sample.
- Are you sure?
Try it!
Hey, wait up!
Let me go!
Tobbe?
Come here.
- What?
I have homework.
- Mom and I saw a video on your computer.
What the hell!
Cameras rolling, do it again with a bit more feel.
Stop it, Hans.
It's not funny.
- The computer was on and the page up.
Tobias, this is some of the worst things I've seen.
How can you say it was a prank by some young guys?
It was before I saw the clip.
How did you even know there was a clip?
- This is just getting more weird.
You're coming down on me for this?
Open and I'll tell you something fun, Kev.
I've got a job, honey!
Can I come in?
Kev?
- What has happened?
- Nothing.
You're all banged up.
Let's see if I got this...
You heard Anita's voice, you thought it was young guys, but you didn't see them.
And you hid Anita's clothes because you thought we'd get mad about that.
Yes.
What have you been up to now?
Before you got home.
I took a walk.
Who did it?
You have to tell me.
You've been assaulted.
We have to call the police.
Shit, if you go on like this, I'll never tell.
I don't want you to call the police, okay?
But what has...
It was just someone, I don't know who.
A fucking madman.
- Wait, wait...
- We're not calling the police?
They won't do anything anyway.
Why don't you want me to call the police, Kevin?
What can they do now?
I don't want a fucking hearing.
What do you say?
I don't know...
I'm calling the police.
It was Kevin.
Therese's Kevin?
Say what you want, I'm calling the police now.
Okay, okay!
It was Tobbe, our old neighbor.
Inger's Tobbe?
Get out!
Get out, and inside!
Hurry up, you bastard!
This shit made her slow and useless.
No more of that!
And you, do you have to look as stupid as you are?
Huh?
Why do I do this?
Why do I take care of you?
I'm so fucking nice.
So fucking nice, I deserve prison.
I'm sorry, Silas.
You're sloppy and don't give a shit about what I've tought you.
- What have I tought you?
You.
- Do not leave the store together.
That's right!
Can you get that into your fucking Windows brains?
Never be seen in a group.
Never!
You can see a idiot here, another idiot there, but three of them together...
Fuck!
Hello?
Kindly open.
My God, it's been 8 years since she passed. 8 years.
It's something like that for me too.
Time rushes by, when you're alone.
Every day is like the next.
It rushes by when you're having fun too.
No, it moves even slower...
Have you had that machine as company since you were widowed.
No, she...
It's new.
I had another one before that.
But, he...
- Tell me.
- He broke.
I'm sorry.
It's probably the vine.
Now let's see!
What Solveig has in her bag.
Tonight, I think we deserve to get a little drunk, you and I.
I don't know...
Hey...
Now we'll see what she's made of, that, whatshername.
- Vera.
- Vera?
Vera, come!
- I can do that.
- No, we'll put her to work.
Yes?
Open.
There.
- Thank you, you can go.
- No, no, no.
Pour.
Enjoy.
Only me?
Pour for us both.
You shouldn't drink more vine, Lennart.
It's not good for you.
Shut up and pour.
Do as I say.
Pour it, Vera.
There...
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Go.
- Why don't you get rid of that bitch?
- She means well.
Sometimes you forget that they're machines.
Cheers!
Cheers.
For the humans.
Let's try again.
What's your name?
Okay.
Your name!
Hey, buddy.
Come.
Soon finished.
Oh.
- What are you doing?
- I liberate her, so she can be one of you.
You think it's scary?
It'll be over soon.
- You feel better now?
- It feels good.
The recycling station.
Haven't I told about it?
Not for the new ones.
Do you know what it is to die?
You get buried.
You disappear.
You no longer exist.
Humans get buried.
But you end up at the recycling station.
That's where Kyra is now.
They have cut out her eyes, cut her body up and taken the battery out.
Opened her skull and removed the brain.
Skinned her, melted it to a pulp.
Drained her of plasma.
She'll be new hubots now.
Without any memory of who they came from.
Wait, wait.
Know this.
One day you won't be around anymore.
You will disappear.
And become new hobots.
- Only if we get caught.
- There will be new models.
You get...
You get old, broken, worthless and no one will want you.
But me.
I'm not like that.
As long as you behave and do as you're told, you get to stay here.
Come on.
He's in love?
In love, not just some...
He's in love.
- So this has been your little secret.
- What was I to do?
He was ashamed.
- He didn't want anyone to find out.
- And he ends up assaulting Kevin.
Not that Kevin is any choir boy...
Should we get rid of her?
Anita?
I think this hubot is more trouble than help right now.
It's a she.
I suggest we sell her.
Anita.
Okay, because she was exploited, she's the problem.
My God, hubots are machines and we've exploited machines for centuries.
Sorry, I heard how that came out, but she's not human.
We're a kind of machine, too.
We marry them, we have sex with them.
We fall in love with them.
- What's the difference?
- We have a soul, a heart and emotions.
Anita was almost raped by a gang of kids today.
God, I'm tired of this.
We copy ourselves and dehumanize them, so that we can exploit them.
Regardless, hubots won't go away, we must learn to live with them.
That's what I'm saying.
I don't want to get rid of them, or Anita.
Just that they should be treated the same.
I can't listen to this anymore.
Welcome back.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Sorry.
- Hey, you...
- Yes.
Did we do it?
I don't know...
What's the time?
10.
What?
God...
Where did I put my clothes?
Get out!
Out!
You have a time to keep?
Yes...
The dog.
My little Nisse is all alone.
Goodbye.
Lover boy.
You have my number.
Call me.
Where's my bag....
I threw it away.
Your number!
Solveig!
Wait!
Egg and bacon, strong coffee?
Could you two help me with a bench press over here?
Well, guys...
Take the cap off, Kev.
- We think you both behaved badly.
- Yes.
Really badly...
Shake hands and say you're sorry.
Stand up, Kev!
Sorry that I hit you... so much.
Kevin!
Well, sorry if I... borrowed your... thing.
Do you know her name?
- No...
- Anita.
Okay.
- A little worse than "borrow", I think.
- We're going to court now?
You don't have to be best buddies, but try to be decent to one another.
Yes.
Kev!
I said I was sorry.
I don't think we get much further here.
I'm glad we got to see each other.
Kevin's 3 here.
At the fair.
He won that.
He was always lucky that way.
- You're bored?
- No.
Let me see.
- Is that you?
- Yes.
Cute.
This is Kevin's soccer team.
He was good at it.
I was supporting coach.
Always there for them.
This is...
I'm sorry.
- Never done this with anyone before.
- Done what?
Can't you see that I'm crying?
I've never done it with someone before.
What's the worst that happened to you?
- I don't know.
- That's okay.
You don't have to know stuff all the time.
I wish you'd met my mother, but she died five years ago.
- Dad died when I was 15.
- That's sad.
- Are yours alive?
- I don't have any.
- No parents?
- No.
- You're an orphan?
- Yes.
- Orphanage?
- No.
Some day when I really trust you, I will tell you.
- You can trust me.
- Some other day.
Okay.
I don't have a job, and the next paycheck will be my last.
But I'm not sad.
Not even worried.
- Do you know why that is?
- No.
- You don't?
- No.
- Not even a hunch?
- No.
Because you're here.
You're here.
That's the way it is.
Please hold for a second.
Excuse me, I have a meeting with a client and I'm running a bit late.
The case is closed.
- Excuse me?
- The case was closed today.
It's not closed, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry, you will not be admitted, there's no appointment and the case is closed.
- Crap game...
- I agree.
Nothing to write home about.
Ove!
- See you.
- Yeah, bye.
- What's happening?
- With?
My client.
Should have told you.
He's in observation.
- The case is closed?
- I'm afraid so.
- It can't be closed.
- Get in the car.
Well?
He may be put to death, in order to do an autopsy.
They can't do this.
You're sworn to secrecy.
This is what will happen.
And the murder investigation?
The victim's next of kin?
- People have the right to know!
- Not this time.
The investigation is ongoing, just without a suspect anymore.
- When will they murder him?
- In that case, tomorrow morning.
I will not let this go.
If they kill him, I will cause a racket!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry if I went ballistic the other day.
It's cool.
Is Bea here?
Yes.
Great.
Great that you two...
Really.
Well, I won't bother you...
Just wanted... to return your keys.
I left a few things in the basement.
It was left when I made the bomb.
Is it okay, if I... get it?
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.
REAL HUMANS
Ugh.
Hey, Aud.
Hey...
You.
Jeff, you know Ana.
She's been cleaning for us for six months.
She sure is dusting off those cookies.
Hola,Mr. Jeff.
I have to apologize for my socks.
My feet sweat a lot, but...
I, uh...
I guess you knew that.
Anyways, uh...
Cerveza.
We should get you and that cleaning lady a maid.
Ana is more than just a cleaning lady.
She's become a friend.
Oh, here we go.
- What?
- She's here to work.
If anybody should get paid to sit and listen to you yammer, it's me.
First of all, if anyone should be compensated for this marriage, it's me.
I should get hazard pay just for having to share a bathroom with you.
And honestly, why do you even care if I sit and chat with Ana?
I'm just saying that you don't have to be best friends with everybody who works for us.
I don't do that.
Then why am I going to the doorman's wedding?
I can't help it.
I'm a people person.
Plus, Ana and I have a very good time together.
You don't even speak the same language.
Oh, my Spanish is a lot better than you think it is, Jeff.
Si, si.
Ana.
Hilario.
Ohhh.
Classic Ana.
She... she kills me.
What, uh...
what did she say?
It's kind of a private joke.
It doesn't translate.
Ah, sir.
I thought you had a lunch.
Well, luckily, I didn't, or it would be all over the floor.
Talk about a wood killer.
Implying that you walked in here with wood.
Always ready to party, Tim.
Ahh.
Whoa, who's the... hey, what's that stuff that restores wood to its natural luster?
- Teak oil?
- Yeah.
Whoa, who's the teak oil?
Stephanie, this syphilitic hobgoblin is my boss.
Enchante.
Russell dunbar...
Wealthy.
Uh, Stephanie is my running buddy.
We motivate each other.
I'd run pretty fast too, if I was being chased by Mahatma Gumby over here.
Okay.
And on that note, we really should get going.
I used to run a little bit.
Ahh.
Really?
Yeah.
Got a bum knee from an old iron man injury.
You did an Ironman triathlon?
Well, I, uh...
I hit a theater seat really hard when I went to see iron man.
It was pretty bad.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.
Ah, Mr. rhodes.
This is Stephanie.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
Yeah.
Hey, guess what.
I guess she's his "running buddy."
No air quotes.
That's literally what she is.
Timmy and I are training for the marathon.
Yes, completing a marathon has long since been a personal goal of mine, which I have so far been unable to achieve.
Hm.
Good luck tottering around Manhattan on those slim Jims you call legs.
Sir, your legs look like two rolls of uncooked pillsbury dough.
Hey, the top-selling pastry in America.
You can't hurt me, Tim.
Hey.
You know, in high school, I was co-captain of my cross-country team, till I pulled a groin.
- Hmm.
- Oh, wow.
Whose was it?
Yours or the other captain's?
Ha, ha.
Nice try embarrassing me, but it was mine.
I pulled my own groin, so...
Well, if you want, you should join us.
You know, I might.
I've been meaning to get back into it.
Well, it might be a bit late in the game.
The marathon's less than a month away.
It doesn't matter.
Running is 90% mental.
Anything you believe you can do, you can do.
- Well.
- Come on, let's go.
- Hm.
- Cheers.
Byebye.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- She really inspired me.
- Yeah, me too.
I'm gonna run a marathon.
I'm gonna nail Stephanie.
- Mm.
- Oh.
Oh, look at that.
You two are hugging now.
We were just saying good-bye, Jeff.
Muchas gracias,miss Aubrey.
Muchas gracias, Mr. Jeff.
Oh.
I'm, uh...
I'm not much of a, uh...
here you go.
All right.
All right, off you go.
- Adios.
- Adios.
What's, uh... what's with all the "muchas gracias"?
Uh, it means "thank you very much."
Yes, I knew that, rosetta stone.
What I meant was, why is she thanking us?
Well, we just did something very generous.
The second I saw you two sharing cookies,
I knew it would lead straight to my wallet.
Look, Ana needs an operation, okay?
I mean, you saw the way she limped out of here.
I just thought her leg had fallen asleep from sitting around listening to you habla.
That, uh...
that means "talk".
Look, we are not gonna pay for the whole operation.
I had a wonderful idea.
She works for other people in the building, so I'm gonna ask them to chip in.
I am bringing the whole community together.
Oh, I get it.
Now you just want to show off to everyone, make 'em think you're a hero.
Oh, well, forgive me.
Unlike you, I actually like doing good things for other people.
Well.
This isn't gonna end well.
How is being the leader of a charitable endeavor not going to end well?
I don't know, but I look forward to you showing me.
Hey, if charity's your game, why not throw a little this way, huh?
Hey, I am happy to contribute.
I think it is so nice what you're doing for Ana.
Oh, I've heard all the adjectives... nice, noble, generous, selfless.
But honestly, I'm just being Audrey.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Did you go for a run or a swim?
Oh, my God, you guys are not gonna believe this.
Okay?
According to my pedometer,
I just ran 30 Miles in a half an hour.
Adam, you have it on clock mode.
You didn't run 30 Miles.
You ran for 30 minutes.
Yeah, but in a half an hour.
You know?
I mean, that's, like, my personal best.
Whew.
Whoa.
Wha... what's happening with the band-aids?
He says it's a runner thing.
Yeah, it prevents nip chafing.
You know how sensitive they can get.
It's pretty smart, huh?
Agh!
Oh.
Oh!
Ouch-less, my ass!
So why did you finally agree to have dinner with me?
Was it the two weeks of gentle stalking?
Actually, it was you emailing me as my friend Caitlin, saying, "meet me at this restaurant."
That was a good one, huh?
Look, you're funny and cute in sort of an ironic way.
That's what I'm going for.
- Well, it's working.
- Hmm.
But you and I are very different people.
Listen, we both put our pants on one leg at a time.
Hopefully, you'll see for yourself in the morning.
None for me, thanks.
I got the marathon coming up.
Then you need to be hydrated.
Or, as I like to call it,
"wine-drated".
Look, I-if this was two years ago, it'd be a very different story.
Really?
I'd like to hear that story.
Well, I used to be a real party girl.
Drinking, staying out late...
One-night stands.
Oh, where did it all go wrong?
I just don't do anything halfway.
And these days, I'm all about running and training.
Hmm.
Well, I understand and respect that.
In fact, let's drink to that.
Oh, you going to the gym?
Move over, mentalist.
There's a new genius in town.
You can't go yet.
Ana's on her way over.
Oh, good.
Well, it's been two weeks.
This place is a dump.
She's not coming to clean.
She wants to thank us for her surgery.
She said she's still a little swollen, but she sounded really happy.
Oh.
That's probably her now.
Hello, Audrey.
I have my check for Ana's surgery.
I'm sorry I'm so late with it.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's fine.
I just went out back and plucked a few more bills off the money tree.
Yeah, well, I-I just wanted to say,
I think that it is so great how you... spearheaded the whole thing?
Well, thank you, but seriously, if I hadn't done it, some other big-hearted person would have.
Oh, Ana!
Hola.
Como estas?
Muy bien,miss Audrey.
Ohhh.
That... that means she's doing very well.
I speak Spanish, so...
Ana, por favor.
Ay, si.
What's with the hitch in her get-along?
Thought we paid to iron that out.
Maybe it's still healing.
Oh, my God.
I definitely see some swelling.
Muchas gracias, miss AudreyyMr.
Jeff.
Muchas gracias.
De nada.
Well, you know, I had my doubts.
But you did good.
Hey.
Bring it in.
Bring it in.
Mr. Jeff.
Oh, my God.
I am so full.
Here's an idea.
Why don't you stop eating?
I'm carbo-loading.
Got the marathon in an hour.
Wait, aren't you supposed to do that the night before?
Aud, who ran cross-country in high school?
I did.
That makes this a little less dramatic, but so did I.
Hey, Timmy.
Ready for your race?
Actually, I've run into a bit of a problem.
I haven't heard from Stephanie in days.
You try looking in me bed?
That's the last place I saw her.
If she's not there, try me shower.
If she's not there... ugh, okay.
We get it, we get it.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
We don'tallget it.
I can't believe you slept with Stephanie.
Oh, now we all get it.
I should've known meeting you would tempt her back to the dark side.
You really should've.
Why would you do this to me, sir?
I don't know, Tim.
Why does anyone do anything?
Why does Audrey want her maid to have huge boobs?
I don't know.
I didn't want her to have huge boobs, okay?
I thought I was doing a good thing.
I thought I was fixing her limp.
Well, ironically, with all that extra weight up top, uh, that, uh...
that limp is worse than ever.
Mm.
Six months of training down the drain.
Well, why can't you do it by yourself?
I've tried, miss Morgan, many a time.
But without someone setting the pace, pushing me forward,
I fear I may never reach this lifelong goal.
I'll be your running buddy.
Well, there's always next year.
Hey, come on.
Come on, Tim.
You've come this far.
Well, I suppose I've got nothing to lose.
That's the spirit.
Now let's get some pancakes in you.
Mr. rhodes, you do know that you're supposed to carbo-load the night before the race.
Um, Tim, who ran cross-country in high school?
I did.
God, I gotta stop asking that question.
- You ready?
- You tell me.
Whoa.
All right, then.
Feel free to leave, imagination.
Won't be needing you.
Going to go and text Stephanie one more time.
Hey, Timmy, look, I don't think she's coming, buddy.
Okay?
And if we're gonna win this thing, you gotta focus.
I'm sorry... win this?
I'm merely hoping to finish in under five hours.
We have no chance of winning.
Not with that negative attitude, you don't.
You know what, Timmy?
I'm sorry, man.
But I'm in it to win it, okay?
And I don't think I can deal with your bring-down 'tude.
So...
Run hard.
Hey, whoa, Tim.
Hey.
Sir.
What on earth are you doing here?
- I found Stephanie.
- Really?
Where is she?
- Okay, she's in Vegas.
- Oh, bullocks.
But don't worry.
We're definitely hooking up when she comes back.
- Terrific.
- Where you going?
I can't do this on my own, sir.
I'm giving up.
No, no.
Giving up?
Tim, come on.
You've set a goal.
And if you can dream it, you can achieve it.
I mean, look at me, buddy.
My goal was to bang your running buddy.
Was that easy?
No.
Were there times I thought of giving up?
Sure.
But I didn't.
And I reached my goal.
Twice.
And you can too.
Reprehensible...
Yet oddly inspiring.
Okay.
Whoa, you're running on those tootsie rolls?
Good luck.
What's up, dudes?
Yeah, you guys look like you're ready to get your 'thon on.
Hey, mind if I tag along?
You know, I ran cross-country in high school.
I'm sure you guys did, too.
Whoa!
You know it's 26 Miles, right?
Please calm down, Mrs. Morris.
I'm going to refund everyone's money.
Wow.
Well, that's some pretty colorful language for a gal your age.
Well, you definitely brought the building together.
Everybody agrees.
They hate you.
I just wanted to feel appreciated.
Well, maybe this will help.
"Dear miss Audrey, I am very sorry
"about the misunderstanding,
"but please know that your generosity
"has changed my life.
"I have never been happier and can't wait to wake up each morning."
Ohh.
That's so nice of Ana.
It's from her husband Carlos.
You know what?
I'll take it.
Now.
If you're still feeling generous...
Where the hell did those Kenyans go?
Oh, God.
Cramps!
Stupid pancakes.
Mr. dunbar was right.
I can do this.
I've worked hard.
I've prepared.
I am the only thing standing in my way.
Oh!
Oh, my knee!
My knee...
Hey, Timmy.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I got a band-aid.
Agh.
Hey, don't feel bad.
You haven't run a marathon in over ten years, so you know,
1,100 yards isn't that bad.
Yeah, I guess.
And the Kenyans finished top three, so our team had a good showing.
Hmm.
I would've been happy just to have finished.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, when I was with Stephanie,
I finished.
I'm sure she didn't.
That's not really my business.
You guys got your food to go?
Uh, yeah, we're gonna eat upstairs while we watch something.
- Yeah.
- See you, girls.
Mmhmm.
This table,por favor.
Maybe under there.
Yo, yo, yo.
Sir, I just put your soup in your office, it's very hot, so...
Ah!
Don't eat it yet.
[Groans]
Ah, it's too hot again.
Sir, I've told you, if you were a bit more patient you wouldn't always burn your tongue.
I know, but it looks so good I want it right now.
- Sir, stop, stop.
- I can't!
It's too good...
What are you doing?
Here, I think this new spoon will solve your problem.
[Gasps]
What, was it up your butt or something?
No, just try it.
Mm, perfect.
Now try your spoon again.
Okay.
[Yells]
Now mine.
[Slurps] Mm, yummy.
And yours again.
Ow!
What's going on here?
Well, sir, I grew tired of you always burning your mouth and spitting hot soup into my face, so I had a friend who works in manufacturing make that spoon.
How do it work?
It's actually two small spoons welded together with a liquid cooling agent in between.
Now, the spoon cools the soup as you bring it to your mouth.
[Slurps] It works.
It really works.
Yes, indeed.
And now, you're able to enjoy your soup and my face will remain unscathed.
See you later and good riddance, stupid old spoon.
- [Thud]
- Ow!
so, it's getting close to baby time.
Do you have her room all set up yet?
No.
As usual, Jeff's dragging his feet.
Getting him to help is like trying to make a pile of water.
I need him to move the old furniture down to the storage area, and he keeps getting distracted.
Mm, Adam starts out distracted and just stays that way.
I think I'm going to have to resort to my secret weapon, which, unfortunately, involves great personal sacrifice.
Maybe you should just give him sex instead.
Sex is the sacrifice.
Ah, so you tell him if he does what you want,
- you'll give him some.
- Oh, God no.
If I set that precedent, he'd be demanding sex every time I asked him to pass the salt.
The key is, I give him some, then I ask him the favor.
He's so relaxed and agreeable, he always says "yes."
Hm,
I wonder if that would work with Adam.
I really want to get a dog, but he doesn't.
Try my system.
I don't know, it sounds kind of manipulative.
Mm.
Spoken like a woman without a dog.
All right, I'll try it.
Oh, here comes Jeff, time to bait the trap.
- Hey.
- [Sighs] Hey.
I just saw a guy I thought was Matthew Modine.
Wasn't.
So, uh, we going to a movie tonight?
Uh, actually, I thought maybe we'd stay in.
I could cook dinner, maybe share a bottle of wine?
Oh, well, that sounds like a roadmap whose destination is the boudoir.
Seems that way, huh?
I hope you're watching.
Learn a little something about how to treat your man.
Oh, I am.
I'm going to go pick out a leash.
Hey.
Good, you're here.
What was so urgent, sir?
I can't stop thinking about our soup spoon invention.
"Our" invention?
Yes, I'm giving you full half-credit.
I've decided that we can market it and sell it.
Sir, I just had the one made for you.
Yes, as usual you were thinking too small.
Check this out.
"Cool hand soup"?
It's so catchy, man.
Bam!
Sir, why do you suddenly want to be in the spoon business?
Ah, I'm sick of riding my father's coattails.
It's time for me to shine.
Good for you, sir.
I'm very pleased to hear you so excited about such a legitimate business venture.
Yeah, thank you, Tim.
It's good to finally have something that's completely mine for once, you know?
Actually, ours.
Easy, Tim, remember there's no "you" in "team."
Nice work, sir.
I know.
Yeah, I, uh, I did that.
[Laughing] You certainly did.
Speaking of doing things, do you think maybe you could get to cleaning the storage area, and moving the second bedroom furniture down there?
Absolutely.
Consider it done.
Too easy.
[Both sigh]
Whoo!
That's what I'm talkin' about.
You did talk a lot.
So, um, you know how I mentioned getting a pet?
Yeah?
Don't you think it's a great idea?
Sure, let's do it.
Really?
Well that's great.
- So I was think...
- But not a dog.
A bird.
What?
Why do you want to get a bird?
I don't know.
Just 'cause.
Yeah.
Yeah, the website's going to sell spoons.
How much storage capability?
I don't know, "up the wazoo"
is what I'll need, I guess.
Okay, Jim, see ya.
Hoo-hoo, making spoon deals, Timmy, it's very exciting.
Idea... contact Ricky Schroeder about endorsement deal.
So, sir, I see you've gone ahead and formed a business plan.
I have, we're gonna launch a website, then post a sales video on it.
I'm gonna get more tail than the guy that invented the spork.
And where exactly are we getting this sales video?
Oh, we're gonna do it.
We'll make it.
I'll be the director and executive producer.
And what will I be?
You're a good kid, Timmy, we'll find something for you.
And, sir, you're confident you possess the necessary skills to shoot a professional video?
Of course.
I learned quite a bit that week
I spent at soft-core fantasy camp.
And we'll shoot it on the video equipment we'll take from my bedroom.
Your bedroom?
But won't the camera be ruined after I boil it?
Ha, ha.
Idea... try to bang new receptionist in lobby.
I can't turn it off, Tim.
You know, these storage lockers would make great aviaries.
Let's try to focus.
I've got to get this all cleaned out for Audrey.
Gotcha.
So, I've narrowed it down to a macaw or an african gray parrot.
Why don't you narrow it down even further...
To a dog.
Dude, birds are great pets.
They're loyal, they lick your face, they show up at the front door with their little tail feathers wagging.
You do know what a bird is, right?
Yes.
And Jen tried to get me to agree to a dog right after we had sex.
Like I owe her some big favor after rocking her world.
I don't know where she got that idea.
Wait a minute.
Speaking of doing things, do you think maybe you could get to cleaning the storage area and moving the second bedroom furniture down there?
Absolutely.
Consider it done.
Really?
Audrey uses that with you?
Yeah, and, uh, you know,
I think she's been doing it for a hell of a long time.
Is it all right if my parents stay with us for a couple of weeks?
Good by me.
Mm.
What do you say we shave this goatee?
It's gone.
[Sighs]
Boy, we've been dating a while, huh?
- Shouldn't we get married?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
Wow, that scam has been pretty good to her.
Are you going to go bust her right now?
No.
Revenge is a dish best served...
After I get some.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
Did you, uh, get the storage area all cleaned up?
As promised.
So, did all the stuff from the baby's room fit down there?
I don't know.
I, uh, didn't move it.
Are you gonna do it soon?
Nah, I kind of ran out of steam.
But I'll get to it.
Maybe.
Maybe?
But last night, you know, after we, uh...
Yeah, I know, but listen...
Cleaning out the locker just got me a little tense.
Well, um, you want me to get you a couple of aspirin?
I don't think that will do it.
Well, why don't we go to the bedroom, and I'll give you a nice massage.
What a delightful and unexpected idea.
Hey, Timmy.
Oh, hello Mr. Rhodes.
What brings you here?
Oh, Russell told me to come by.
I'm starring in a movie or something.
Well, it's not actually a movie, it's a web video to try and sell spoons.
Eh, still getting my foot in the door.
And this is the set.
That's Hollywood talk for the place we'll be filming.
It's pretty "maj."
- Wow.
- Yeah.
In fact, Meryl Streep got her start in a video very much like this one.
Who's Meryl Streep?
I don't know, I'm too busy watching the twilight films, they're good.
These guys are my lackeys.
Lackeys, this is Amber.
Hi.
It's Adam, actually.
Hi.
I gotta go potty.
Oh, aren't you adorable?
Well, it's right out there.
Sir, who exactly is she?
She was my counselor at soft-core fantasy camp.
I promised her a role in a movie.
Is she my co-star?
'Cause I thought we had great chemistry.
Mr. Dunbar, I thought you were taking this business venture seriously.
Timmy, are you doubting Amber's ability to add value to our sales video?
Russell?
I couldn't find the potty, and I think I lost one of my shoes.
Well, are you?
- Whew.
- Wow.
That massage got away from you pretty quickly.
Yeah.
I just couldn't control myself.
Two days in a row.
Haven't done that in a while.
Yup.
It's going to be tough to say good-bye to that streak.
Well, I owe you, hon.
Oh, you don't have to...
Mm, you know, actually, it would be nice if you could move that furniture into the storage area.
I could definitely do that.
- Mm.
- But I don't feel like it.
Great.
Wait, what?
Well, I don't...
[Sighs]
I don't feel like it.
But, it would make me so happy, my big, strong man.
Drop the act, sister.
I'm on to you.
Whatever are you talking about?
You give me sex, and then you ask me to do things.
[Laughs] Jeff, I have no idea what you...
Don't embarrass yourself.
You've had a good run, but it's over.
Nicely played.
You got the sex first.
Well, I wasn't married yesterday.
I win.
Mm, except, that most of the sex you get is based on my system of needing you to do things, which is now over.
I win a little less.
What are you doing?
Just reading this latest issue of birds usa.
Hey, check out the crest on this northern lapland, huh?
Whoa.
Yeah, you like what you see?
I do.
That plumage would definitely attract a mate.
Well, too bad.
What do you mean?
I mean that until you agree to get a dog,
I'm withholding sex.
[Scoffs] Good luck.
What do you mean, "good luck"?
You want it as much as I do.
Plus, I mean, come on.
Look at this, huh?
There's no way you can resist this.
Huh?
Flat-ish stomach.
Perfect amount of chest hair.
Oopsie.
Did I drop something?
Oh yeah?
Well I can drop stuff too.
Huh?
Check out these tight buns.
Oh, what?
Did somebody say, "silken, creamy thighs"?
We're getting a bird.
We're getting a dog.
- A bird.
- Dog.
- Bird!
- Dog!
Aw, look at this little guy, hey, hey there.
Just so you know, neither of these are allowed in the building.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Listen, I've been thinking about my whole system of, you know, me doing stuff, so you'll do stuff,
I don't know, maybe it's good that it's over.
How so?
Well, from now on, if I ask you to do something, you'll do it because you love and support me.
And if we have sex, it will be solely as an expression of our love for each other.
[Both laughing]
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I got through that with a straight face.
Yeah, listen...
I think I've come up with, um, something a little bit more realistic.
Hm.
I have put together a pretty comprehensive
"sex for chores" list.
"Sex for chores"?
Isn't that a little crass?
A little, yes.
But I think it'll really streamline our marriage all the way up until we're dead.
Hmm, all right, whatever gets us there.
Right?
Okay.
So, look, all right,
I know that you want me to move all the second bedroom stuff down to the storage locker.
I do.
Okay, well, let's look at the chart.
Under "household chores/ heavy lifting" and this is the act that you'd have to perform.
That seems a little excessive.
Well, let's just check out the conversion chart...
And you'll see that one of those equals two of these.
Lady's choice.
I've never felt more like a lady.
How about instead
I give you this.
Oh, please, I can do that myself.
In fact, let's just cross this one out.
I'm better at it anyways.
You know, sometimes you are so annoying,
I wish you'd just shut up.
I will...
If you do this.
All right, you guys have the honor of seeing the world premiere of the video that's going to launch my new business.
Our new business.
My new business.
Feast your eyes.
You love steaming hot soup...
But hate the nightmare of eating it.
And waiting for it to cool, who has that kind of time?
[Clock ticking]
You try cooling it with ice cubes.
[Harp strings chime]
But that just makes it cold and watery.
We can use the other shot again...
The problem is your old, outdated spoon.
But wait, there's a better way.
[Musical chime]
That's right, it's "cool hand soup".
New "cool hand soup" spoon.
Don't let regular spoons destroy your life anymore.
Okay, got the camera set up.
All right.
Let's get a little weird this time.
[Giggles] Ooh!
We can edit that out.
All right, that really didn't work for me
I think we need a chunkier soup, do we have a chowder?
That's better, but, uh, let's try a minestrone.
All right, all right, just, wait, wait...
You know, I liked that.
But you know what, let's do one more tomato again.
All right, I'm done...
Okay, all right, we're ready to shoot this.
2x07 - "Breakout"
You think Betty's okay?
She doesn't have a fever.
Maybe it's food poisoning.
We believe our latest targeting metrics will work with precision, and that we will finally be able to aim
- the HEARPE device with accuracy.
- That's good to hear, Dr. Kleinberg, we wouldn't want another Haiti situation on our hands.
Haitians would have been fine if they had proper building code.
I mean honestly, you'd think they never heard of rebar.
- Just make sure it works.
- Oh, it will.
How?
I was under the impression that we needed the algorithm hidden in the Tesla letters to make it work?
Nikola Tesla wasn't the only genius who ever lived.
Synequanon's best minds have been working on the physics of this problem.
I'm not gonna hurt you, but if you utter so much as a peep I'll close your carotid artery long enough for you to pass out... and trust me, it feels like dying and you don't want me to do it.
Nod if you understand.
Okay, then.
We're gonna walk toward my car.
Who are you?
I'm just a hired hand, honey.
Don't matter who I am.
Moz!
Betty!
One more step and I cap you both.
Now down with the piece.
Kick it away.
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you, white boy?
- Who are you working for?
- I'm an independent contractor.
For who?
Someone who wants this little girl away from you.
It all has to do with the strength and intensity of the microwave beam;
how many megawatts per second we project;
where it's focused on the parabola of the troposphere.
Lastly, we've taken...
Let's send a message to Mr. Pong.
Show him who's boss.
Inputting.
You like to do the honors?
- Yeah.
- For my country.
- What is that?
- Earthquake.
That's not natural.
Get her out of here!
You are definitely my kind of guy.
- See you on the rebound, white boy.
- Not if I see you first.
Who was that fantastic woman?
I was a secret agent, betrayed by my own people.
Robbed of my face, my memories, my history.
Hidden in my past is a secret that threatens all humanity.
I search for answers with nothing to hold onto but the tattoo that has become my name.
I am Thirteen.
These were the scenes today in Cupertino, California... the heart of Silicon Valley.
At 4:20 PM, a series of freak earthquakes struck the United
States from North Carolina, across the Midwest to California, which was hit the hardest with a devastating 9.0 quake.
The long awaited "big one" registered off the coast of
Marin County, displacing the Heyward fault and causing a tsunami to enter into the San Francisco Bay.
Water levels rose fifteen feet in some areas, flooding Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, and San Jose.
At this hour, Cupertino is still in receding floodwaters and the death toll is mounting.
Smartphone lovers will be particularly distraught at the disaster, which hit the primary production facility for the upcoming Synequafone 5, which will now surely miss its launch date.
Look what you did!
You goddamned idiot!
You egg headed smug moron!
You sank Silicon Valley!
- Please.
- You said you knew!
Mr. Amos... understand, the calculations for the HEARPE technology to successfully strike the appropriate coordinates on the planet are are very tricky.
The coordinates are tricky!
You said you knew let's make it simple Kleinberg, here...
You hit what you shoot at!
You hit it!
Jesus Mary and Joseph!
What are you doing Samuel?
- We are gonna be fine, we will prevail.
- You don't understand.
- Don't I?
- No, you don't.
'Cause we've been working on this with this eggheads for over a year!
They said they had it right!
There's no more time.
Pong and the Chinese have all three Tesla letters.
If they decode them and discover Tesla's targeting algorithm...
We're screwed...
We're screwed aren't we?
My head or yours!
Sir, we need to discuss FEMA allocations... !
Just put what you need into a memo!
Sir, I have the President of France on line 3... !
You tell that ugly midget fart my cheese plate is full!
Sir, we need to deploy the National Guard to prevent looting... !
You need my approval for that?
Do it!
Mr. President, Congress has prepared an emergency act which requires immediate signing!
- You expect me to read all this tripe?
- No time, sir.
All right everybody...
Shut the hell up!
I said shut your goddamn pie holes!
- Kill that ringtone and clear this room!
- You heard him!
Everybody out!
Everybody!
The President requires a closed room meeting.
- You want me to leave as well, sir?
- No, Reynolds.
I want you to get me that snot faced, backstabbing snake...
Amos on the horn.
Pronto!
Yes, sir.
Please connect this line to Samuel, Amos, Synequanon.
Quickly!
They're tracking him down.
Amos?
What is it, Mr. President, I'm very busy.
We just lost our West Coast technology center.
Your technology center?
Well, we just lost the goddamned Silicon Valley.
The stock market is in the toilet!
So, what's the purpose of your call, Mr. President?
You know goddamned well why I'm calling, and you have nothing to thank but your own goddamned hubris.
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
Like hell you don't!
I forbade you to test that goddamned HEARPE device again!
- Forbade it!
- We did not test the HEARPE device.
You've been misinformed.
It was an earthquake... an act of God.
- Like hell it was!
It was HEARPE!
- Prove it.
All right, you listen to me, mister high and mighty CEO...
I don't give a rat's ass how much money I owe Synequanon for getting me into office...
I am still Commander in Chief, and I still got plenty of time to make your life a living hell.
- The older the dog, the louder the bark.
- I don't care anymore.
You hear me?
!
I don't care!
Now, I should never have allocated funds to that goddamned HEARPE device.
But, I am gonna make sure that that goddamned thing is disassembled before I am out on the street.
- If you live that long.
- Was that a threat?
No, Mr. president.
That was a genuine expression of deep concern.
You should calm down.
Maybe count to ten.
I wouldn't want you to die of a heart attack now.
This is war, Finnegan!
We've got to hunker down and watch our six.
We're getting hit by a friendly fire!
No, we cannot leave this office Finnegan... the fate of the world depends on it...
you gotta find a legal loophole.
Um, yes, Mr. President.
Well?
Don't you stand there?
You wanna serve your country...
do smething!
San Francisvo is in ruins.
And the California technology...
Why do you think someone's trying to kidnap you, Betty?
That woman was a professional.
Someone's gone through lots of effort to try and get
- you away from Moz and me.
- Of course, I wonder.
I also wonder who exactly killed my brother.
You seem pretty calm about it.
Calm?
The world is falling apart.
Thousands are dead today after the long awaited "big one"
at the California Bay Area.
Earthquake my ass!
All this damage is caused by HEARPE.
And somehow, you are the center of it all.
Someone made a double of you...
and he's after the letters.
You and the letters are connected.
And they all link to HEARPE.
If you help us find those letters, it will lead you to the people who stole your identity.
- And Max Vargas?
- He's connected to this too.
- The question is how deeply.
- Max?
I know you better than you know yourselves.
Max Verrier?
It's impossible.
There's more.
Your activist friend, share any of this with you?
Just to be sure I understood.
You have no idea whatsoever who's behind those generous donations?
This wine really does have a fine bouquet.
However, the tannins are a touch aggressive for my liking,
I much prefer a Los Vasquos Cabernet Sauvignon.
You wouldn't happen to have one of those in your cellar now, would you?
The donations.
Who made them?
I told you everything that I know.
In great detail.
They came to see me.
Each time with a new middle-man:
lawyers, private investigators, business executives.
They all wanted to help the movement.
And you never asked where the money came from?
Nor did they ask what I would do with it.
They were "Angel Investors."
Their only request was for the movement to remain pacifist and for us to bring media attention to a certain number of targets.
Like HEARPE.
Or just needed to breathe longer.
What about the Tesla letters?
They explained that Synequanon had been already testing HEARPE.
They said if the letter went to the Chinese, it would slow them down.
And the offer to permanently finance failed if I agree to be middleman myself. {*}
You expect me to believe that?
As long as we have common interest why do I give a shit about your bussiness?
I am an anti-global activist.
Not an imbecile.
I know there are hard choices, but I never wanted to be a terrorist to...
- to hurt anyone.
- Yeah, but you did.
No no no no.
They're crazy, I did thirty. {*} It's him you want.
When did you learn about the other letters?
I saw... we are fighting her, so I found a Professor of Climatology.
She had written about Tesla.
And I wanted to know more.
So you had her downed. {*}
I just wanted to make sure but she told me nothing.
It's only after Betty came out with the one her brother gave her that I knew something was wrong, that we were being played.
And I wanted to destroy the letter, but then XIII came, almost killed us both.
I am ready to take the fall for my ideals, not for some crazy lunatic that I barely know.
- Your ideals?
- I have a clear conscience.
I'm fighting for those who have no voice and I have paid my fair share of suffering.
I have bled for the rights of the Earth.
But that does not mean that I have to eat potatoes and drink goat's milk for the rest of my life.
- Is there espresso?
- Take him away.
Hold... hold on, mi amigo.
We haven't spoken about my relocation.
I was thinking Boulder, Colorado.
First of all, I'm not your "amigo."
Secondly, you're going to Guantanamo for pre-trial holding.
Guantanamo?
Look, I told you everything.
We had a deal!
I'm a man of my word.
So please, keep yours.
Drop all charges against Betty and the rest of The Veil members.
I'm afraid it's not so simple Mr. Vargas, or Verrier, whatever your name is.
You're a terrorist.
You need to be judged before a court of law.
The American people wouldn't understand otherwise.
The food is not as fancy as in Boulder, Colorado, but...
I'll make sure you get VIP treatment.
Mentiroso!
Culebra!
Culebra!
You haven't finished your steak.
Max is in Federal custody.
We don't even know where.
- I know where.
- How?
If he's undergoing rendition he'll be held at one of three rotating black ops facilities
- awaiting transport to Guantanamo.
- Guantanamo?
Yeah, we'll never get him there, so we need to get him at the jump point.
Unless CIA protocols changed, they'll be using the Davenport base in South Carolina this month.
Are you suggesting we break him out?
The base will have minimal security, the prisoners are kept in isolation in these time locked bunkers.
It's... it's almost impossible to crack without the right passcode.
For that, we're gonna need a Wizard.
A Wizard?
What are you doing here?
Who are they?
Were you followed?
Look.
Relax, Barnabis.
They're cool.
You know I don't like strangers.
All right?
Last time you visited me the DHS put the eye of Sauron on me...
I had to ditch my pad, and my awesome comic book collection.
So, thanks.
Now I'm living like a goddamned gypsy!
Look, we need you.
What is it this time?
We need you to crack a type 19 CIA lockdown passcode at a remote site.
- Why, may I ask?
- We need to break out a friend.
And get into the temp lockdown at Davenport.
Are, are you kidding me?
!
I don't do fieldwork...
you know that.
All right?
- But...
- No, no, no.
The answer is no, flat out, unequivocal, NO.
- Bye.
No.
- I thought he was a Wizard.
What?
!
Oh, oh...
Oh, I...
I am.
I am.
Okay.
But this goes above and beyond the normal spell.
All right?
This is a quest, and people get killed on quests.
But don't they also win the hearts of the fair ladies?
Um.
Uh.
Yes.
Y... yes.
I suppose if you uh...
if you logic it out.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah.
DAVENPORT INTERNMENT CAMP
This is a secure zone.
We've got two more in from UCMJ for the next flight to Gitmo.
Roger, that.
Check your papers with Classification.
What the hell is this?
Two last minute passengers for the Gitmo Express, sir.
I'm not expecting any new arrivals.
Who ordered this?
Command said it's critical that these two terrorist suspects make the flight.
I've got nothin' in the book about new arrivals.
We're on lockdown.
There must be some mistake.
Really?
This is Fazad al-Hamaq, the Butcher of Kandahar.
- What about that one?
- That's, um...
Umal Hazan al-Abad.
Shut up!
Sir, these men are very dangerous.
I don't know...
What am I supposed to do...
Holy shit!
Stow those men!
Oh my God, I'm freaking out!
It's too much open space.
I wanna go home!
Move it.
Move, move, move.
- I'm...
I'm having a hot flash!
- You do this one thing for me?
- I swear I will get you home.
Okay?
- Are you insane?
I'm in an orange freaking jump suit.
Talk about a target!
I'm Piggy in the goddamn Lord of The Flies!
I knew, I know what happens to guys like me!
I never should have agreed to come.
Stay calm.
All right?
I've got your back.
- It's a redundant fractal impedance lock.
- Okay, okay.
The, the, the mechanism has a chaotic rotation tumbler...
It's impossible to predict the combination of the day, unless you have a mind for numbers.
The key code fractal is nine times out of ten the sum of the squares of the reactance of the circuit, which is always expressed in ohms.
Oh... kay, oh, ah.
Okay.
Cover the entrance.
Moz, you're with me.
- Alright.
- No, no, no.
You see someone you shoot him.
What's the hell is going on here?
It's the CIA no-touch torture technique.
It's by the book.
Max Vargas!
You came for me, you came for me.
We gotta get you out of here.
My friend!
Take me, take me too!
- I'm sorry...
I can't.
- What about me?
- I'm from Canada!
- We must take them with us.
- No.
- Please!
They deserve due process.
What happens here is... is inhuman!
He's right, man.
Han shot first!
Han shot first!
Han shot first!
Han shot first!
Betty, now would be a good time for diversion.
Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
- Let's go!
- Freeze!
Han shot first!
We gotta go, we gotta go now!
Come on.
Wooo!
Nice shot, but we gotta go, let's go!
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go!
- My friends...
- Don't give us that, Max...
- What do you mean?
- We're not your friends.
You betrayed us.
We've seen the contents of your locker, Vargas.
Or should we call you Verrier?
We know you're not who you claimed to be.
And we know you're on the take.
- You sold us out, Max.
- It's not like that, Betty.
Just think of what this money can do for the impoverished.
I may have made an unethical deal, but I made it for ethical reasons!
The world is much more complicated than you think it is.
There is no black and white!
I am a revolutionary.
And I believe everything they've told you all.
So who obeyed you of?
{*} There was a lot of money.
A lot of money.
I think you're the only who understand that, Betty. {*}
I don't know what he's talking about.
But Betty...
I still love you.
Forget it.
We won't get anything out of him tonight.
I'll take the first shift watching him, you run second.
All right.
Sir, just received news of a breakout in our Davenport rendition facility.
- Vargas escaped.
- Well, that seals it.
My legacy has just become a dog's breakfast.
Except that we also ve XIII on video aiding in the escape.
That sneaky bastard.
First he kills eighty-two in the Synequanon bombing.
Now he teams up with terrorists.
The press is gonna burn me alive, Reynolds.
Not exactly, sir.
Alright, then say what the hell are you talking about?
This could be spammed {*} workin' your advantage.
- How so?
- You remember the 2000 election?
Mmm, hanging chads.
Those were the good old days.
We're in a national crisis and now with... with XIII at large we have every justification to move national security to Red Alert, declare Martial Law, and legally a postpone the transfer of power.
- Postpone the transfer of power?
- Indefinitely.
Indefin... indefinitely.
This evening, during President Carrington's adress to the nation, {*} the rule of law was transferred to military authority.
By this order, due to our continuing state of emergency and our current and ongoing threat to National Security,
I have made the difficult decision to declare Martial Law.
God bless America.
Moz, we've known each other for many years, you know I love you like a brother.
Sorry for all that has happened.
It's okay, Max, but brothers don't lie to brothers.
I know.
I am guilty.
I hope that one day you can forgive me.
Then you, you can go to sleep if you wish.
I am, I am tired too.
Maybe we can, we can both sleep.
Nah.
I'm not gonna fall for that.
I have to watch you.
- I won't run.
- How do I know that?
I want to prove myself, earn your trust again.
- Sorry, Max.
- Okay, Moz.
Fair enough.
Operator, I'd like to make an overseas collect call.
The number is 01144-5551925201.
Yes I'll hold.
Answer.
Please.
Please.
It's me...
Verrier.
Yes.
I managed to escape.
No it's... it's a long story.
I need to be brought in.
No, I can't.
Can you send an extraction team?
I know where the girl is.
Yes, she's with him, and the black man.
No.
She's safe.
No.
I didn't talk.
You have to believe me.
Bring me in and I'll tell you everything.
Yes, I am outside the Barrier city, {*} I am in the phone booth on the corner of Allain Cure {*} and 65th Street.
It's just by the railyard.
What took you so long?
You!
Damn!
He was my best friend for years, man!
I loved the guy.
He promised he wouldn't leave...
Oh, he, that's nice, he promised.
Everywhere was quiet, everybody else was sleeping...
That's what it means to take shifts.
Sleeping right?
Some people sleep and others stay awake.
I know, I'm sorry.
I was tired!
Okay?
Voilá!
Sometimes I even surprise myself.
What, you did it?
Should your doppelganger contact you again, press the button on the side of the earwig three times, and hold down the last press...
It'll create a ping echo, which will act much like a homing device.
- Thanks, Barnabis.
- That's "Mr." Wizard to you, all right?
And listen, be careful, my man.
There are bad forces afoot.
All right?
Things are not as they seem, and if you go chasing them, you might just end up running down a rabbit hole.
You take care of yourself too.
- You too.
- Thanks.
Mierda!
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Unless you want to be at the center of an implosive force that will vaporize you.
Listen very carefully and follow my instructions if you want to live.
If you attempt to deactivate the device, you will detonate.
If you don't do as I say, you will detonate.
You understand?
Why... are you doing this to me?
Uh uh, I do the talking.
Good.
You'll find a compass and a security card in your right hand pocket.
Do not lose either.
Hold the compass up and head North.
In twenty feet, turn left then walk up the stairs.
Where am I?
Never mind that.
You're doing well, my friend.
Now, there's a door at the end of the stairs.
Use the security card to open it.
Make a left, proceed to the end of the hall.
This is a great and historic moment.
By endorsing the Carrington Accord, Nigeria accepts its responsibility, the responsibility it shares with every nation to protect our planet.
That's right.
Now.
Cross the room and go through the door directly in front of you.
You're almost there.
Swipe the card key again.
Enter the room.
It's almost over.
I do this action of my own free will...
Boooomb!
This morning a suicide bomber has gained entrance to the White House, injuring President Carrington and several other White House staff and claiming the life of Wole Madaki, President of Nigeria.
He killed the President of Nigeria.
...no one has immediately come forward to claim responsibility for the attack, the Department of Homeland
Security released a statement linking the attack to the
Synequanon bombing and Veil leader, Max Vargas.
We now go to News One White House correspondent, Bill Bartlett.
I thought you were too quiet.
Poor, poor Vargas, so close to getting away scot-free.
You're sick.
What did he ever do to you?
- What indeed.
- I'm coming after you, you deranged...
And then what?
You have no purpose, no reason.
You don't even have any friends or family, or a special someone to go home to.
Now I'm your only family.
So you be careful and don't insult the woman who gave us this face.
Go to hell.
I'm not your brother.
Oh, yes you are.
More than you know.
She's sick, again.
Listen, I've found a trace on my double.
I'm going after him.
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no.
I have to do this alone.
And you better get moving, all right?
Get a new squat.
Whatever you do, just keep an eye on her, okay?
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- All right.
- All right?
- All right.
You okay in there?
I'm fine.
You sure?
Yes.
I just need a few minutes.
It's gonna to be okay.
I'm gonna protect you.
Even if I tell you something you won't like?
Because I might be in trouble.
Moz?
- Congratulations!
- What?
If you don't want me to put a hole in daddy's head,
I'm gonna ask that you follow me.
I think it's his, the doubles.
He never ever loved you!
Max did.
- I did.
- I didn't ask for this.
He didn't care about you!
Okay, I have urgent business with the young lady, so if you don't mind.
Too bad we didn't meet under different circumstances.
Betty!
You're a handsome guy, you know that?
I've been ugly before, let me tell you, it sucks.
Yeah, I've been so many people.
I can't even remember who I used to be.
It took some time, but now,
I think I like being you more than you like being you.
To the end this time?
You think this started with you?
You think it's gonna end with me?
Aghh.
Hey, hey.
What did Jones whisper to you that night I popped her?
She told me, that she knew who you are.
I told you...
it doesn't end with me.
What was that?
Going somewhere, brother?
Listen.
You're not real.
Oh, I'm as real as you are.
Like hell you are.
I just killed you.
Then how do you explain me talking to you right now?
Programming.
You're just a voice planted in my head.
You shouldn't do this.
You hid that last Tesla letter on that ship.
And that's gonna lead me to whoever started this.
I wanna know what happened to me and why you're still inside my head.
I'm gonna find out who's responsible for givin' you my face and I'm gonna kill them!
You might not like what you'll find.
I'm finishing this.
I'm gonna take this to the end.
Then, bon voyage, brother.
Bon voyage.
2x07 - "Breakout"
[music]
[throwing up]
You think Betty's okay?
She doesn't have a fever.
Maybe it's food poisoning.
[engine stalling]
[music]
We believe our latest targeting metrics will work with precision, and that we will finally be able to aim
- the HEARPE device with accuracy.
- That's good to hear, Dr. Kleinberg, we wouldn't want another Haiti situation on our hands.
Haitians would have been fine if they had proper building code.
I mean honestly, you'd think they never heard of rebar.
- Just make sure it works.
- Oh, it will.
How?
I was under the impression that we needed the algorithm hidden in the Tesla letters to make it work?
Nikola Tesla wasn't the only genius who ever lived.
Synequanon's best minds have been working on the physics of this problem.
[music]
I'm not gonna hurt you, but if you utter so much as a peep I'll close your carotid artery long enough for you to pass out... and trust me, it feels like dying and you don't want me to do it.
Nod if you understand.
Okay, then.
We're gonna walk toward my car.
Who are you?
I'm just a hired hand, honey.
Don't matter who I am.
Moz!
Betty!
[music]
One more step and I cap you both.
Now down with the piece.
Kick it away.
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you, white boy?
- Who are you working for?
- I'm an independent contractor.
For who?
Someone who wants this little girl away from you.
It all has to do with the strength and intensity of the microwave beam;
how many megawatts per second we project;
where it's focused on the parabola of the troposphere.
Lastly, we've taken...
Let's send a message to Mr. Pong.
Show him who's boss.
Inputting.
[music]
You like to do the honors?
- Yeah.
- For my country.
[music]
- What is that?
- Earthquake.
That's not natural.
[music] [gunshot]
Get her out of here!
[music]
You are definitely my kind of guy.
- See you on the rebound, white boy.
- Not if I see you first.

- You said you knew!
Mr. Amos... understand, the calculations for the HEARPE technology to successfully strike the appropriate coordinates on the planet are are very tricky.
The coordinates are tricky!
You said you knew let's make it simple Kleinberg, here...
You hit what you shoot at!
You hit it!
Jesus Mary and Joseph!
What are you doing Samuel?
- We are gonna be fine, we will prevail.
- You don't understand.
- Don't I?
- No, you don't.
'Cause we've been working on this with this eggheads for over a year!
They said they had it right!
There's no more time.
Pong and the Chinese have all three Tesla letters.
If they decode them and discover Tesla's targeting algorithm...
We're screwed...
We're screwed aren't we?
My head or yours!
Sir, we need to discuss FEMA allocations... !
Just put what you need into a memo!
Sir, I have the President of France on line 3... !
You tell that ugly midget fart my cheese plate is full!
Sir, we need to deploy the National Guard to prevent looting... !
You need my approval for that?
Do it!
Mr. President, Congress has prepared an emergency act which requires immediate signing!
- You expect me to read all this tripe?
- No time, sir.
All right everybody...
Shut the hell up!
I said shut your goddamn pie holes!
- Kill that ringtone and clear this room!
- You heard him!
Everybody out!
Everybody!
The President requires a closed room meeting.
- You want me to leave as well, sir?
- No, Reynolds.
I want you to get me that snot faced, backstabbing snake...
Amos on the horn.
Pronto!
Yes, sir.
Please connect this line to Samuel, Amos, Synequanon.
Quickly!
They're tracking him down.
Amos?
What is it, Mr. President, I'm very busy.
We just lost our West Coast technology center.
Your technology center?
Well, we just lost the goddamned Silicon Valley.
The stock market is in the toilet!
So, what's the purpose of your call, Mr. President?
You know goddamned well why I'm calling, and you have nothing to thank but your own goddamned hubris.
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
Like hell you don't!
I forbade you to test that goddamned HEARPE device again!
- Forbade it!
- We did not test the HEARPE device.
You've been misinformed.
It was an earthquake... an act of God.
- Like hell it was!
It was HEARPE!
- Prove it.
All right, you listen to me, mister high and mighty CEO...
I don't give a rat's ass how much money I owe Synequanon for getting me into office...
I am still Commander in Chief, and I still got plenty of time to make your life a living hell.
- The older the dog, the louder the bark.
- I don't care anymore.
You hear me?
!
I don't care!
Now, I should never have allocated funds to that goddamned HEARPE device.
But, I am gonna make sure that that goddamned thing is disassembled before I am out on the street.
- If you live that long.
- Was that a threat?
No, Mr. president.
That was a genuine expression of deep concern.
You should calm down.
Maybe count to ten.
I wouldn't want you to die of a heart attack now.
This is war, Finnegan!
We've got to hunker down and watch our six.
We're getting hit by a friendly fire!
No, we cannot leave this office Finnegan... the fate of the world depends on it...
you gotta find a legal loophole.
Um, yes, Mr. President.
Well?
Don't you stand there?
You wanna serve your country...
do smething!
[music]
San Francisvo is in ruins.
And the California technology...
Why do you think someone's trying to kidnap you, Betty?
That woman was a professional.
Someone's gone through lots of effort to try and get
- you away from Moz and me.
- Of course, I wonder.
I also wonder who exactly killed my brother.
You seem pretty calm about it.
Calm?
The world is falling apart.
Thousands are dead today after the long awaited "big one"
at the California Bay Area.
Earthquake my ass!
All this damage is caused by HEARPE.
And somehow, you are the center of it all.
Someone made a double of you...
and he's after the letters.
You and the letters are connected.
And they all link to HEARPE.
If you help us find those letters, it will lead you to the people who stole your identity.
- And Max Vargas?
- He's connected to this too.
- The question is how deeply.
- Max?
I know you better than you know yourselves.
Max Verrier?
It's impossible.
There's more.
Your activist friend, share any of this with you?
Just to be sure I understood.
You have no idea whatsoever who's behind those generous donations?
This wine really does have a fine bouquet.
However, the tannins are a touch aggressive for my liking,
I much prefer a Los Vasquos Cabernet Sauvignon.
You wouldn't happen to have one of those in your cellar now, would you?
[laughs]
The donations.
Who made them?
I told you everything that I know.
In great detail.
They came to see me.
Each time with a new middle-man:
lawyers, private investigators, business executives.
They all wanted to help the movement.
And you never asked where the money came from?
Nor did they ask what I would do with it.
They were "Angel Investors."
Their only request was for the movement to remain pacifist and for us to bring media attention to a certain number of targets.
Like HEARPE.
Or just needed to breathe longer.
What about the Tesla letters?
They explained that Synequanon had been already testing HEARPE.
They said if the letter went to the Chinese, it would slow them down.
And the offer to permanently finance failed if I agree to be middleman myself. {*}
You expect me to believe that?
As long as we have common interest why do I give a shit about your bussiness?
I am an anti-global activist.
Not an imbecile.
I know there are hard choices, but I never wanted to be a terrorist to...
- to hurt anyone.
- Yeah, but you did.
No no no no.
They're crazy, I did thirty. {*} It's him you want.
When did you learn about the other letters?
I saw... we are fighting her, so I found a Professor of Climatology.
She had written about Tesla.
And I wanted to know more.
So you had her downed. {*}
I just wanted to make sure but she told me nothing.
It's only after Betty came out with the one her brother gave her that I knew something was wrong, that we were being played.
And I wanted to destroy the letter, but then XIII came, almost killed us both.
I am ready to take the fall for my ideals, not for some crazy lunatic that I barely know.
- Your ideals?
- I have a clear conscience.
I'm fighting for those who have no voice and I have paid my fair share of suffering.
I have bled for the rights of the Earth.
But that does not mean that I have to eat potatoes and drink goat's milk for the rest of my life.
- Is there espresso?
- Take him away.
Hold... hold on, mi amigo.
We haven't spoken about my relocation.
I was thinking Boulder, Colorado.
First of all, I'm not your "amigo."
Secondly, you're going to Guantanamo for pre-trial holding.
Guantanamo?
Look, I told you everything.
We had a deal!
I'm a man of my word.
So please, keep yours.
Drop all charges against Betty and the rest of The Veil members.
I'm afraid it's not so simple Mr. Vargas, or Verrier, whatever your name is.
You're a terrorist.
You need to be judged before a court of law.
The American people wouldn't understand otherwise.
The food is not as fancy as in Boulder, Colorado, but...
I'll make sure you get VIP treatment.
Mentiroso!
Culebra!
Culebra!
You haven't finished your steak.
Max is in Federal custody.
We don't even know where.
- I know where.
- How?
If he's undergoing rendition he'll be held at one of three rotating black ops facilities
- awaiting transport to Guantanamo.
- Guantanamo?
Yeah, we'll never get him there, so we need to get him at the jump point.
Unless CIA protocols changed, they'll be using the Davenport base in South Carolina this month.
Are you suggesting we break him out?
The base will have minimal security, the prisoners are kept in isolation in these time locked bunkers.
It's... it's almost impossible to crack without the right passcode.
For that, we're gonna need a Wizard.
A Wizard?
What are you doing here?
Who are they?
Were you followed?
Look.
Relax, Barnabis.
They're cool.
You know I don't like strangers.
All right?
Last time you visited me the DHS put the eye of Sauron on me...
I had to ditch my pad, and my awesome comic book collection.
So, thanks.
Now I'm living like a goddamned gypsy!
Look, we need you.
What is it this time?
We need you to crack a type 19 CIA lockdown passcode at a remote site.
- Why, may I ask?
- We need to break out a friend.
And get into the temp lockdown at Davenport.
Are, are you kidding me?
!
I don't do fieldwork...
you know that.
All right?
- But...
- No, no, no.
The answer is no, flat out, unequivocal, NO.
- Bye.
No.
- I thought he was a Wizard.
What?
!
Oh, oh...
Oh, I...
I am.
I am.
Okay.
But this goes above and beyond the normal spell.
All right?
This is a quest, and people get killed on quests.
But don't they also win the hearts of the fair ladies?
Um.
Uh.
Yes.
Y... yes.
I suppose if you uh...
if you logic it out.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah.
DAVENPORT INTERNMENT CAMP [music]
This is a secure zone.
We've got two more in from UCMJ for the next flight to Gitmo.
Roger, that.
Check your papers with Classification.
What the hell is this?
Two last minute passengers for the Gitmo Express, sir.
I'm not expecting any new arrivals.
Who ordered this?
Command said it's critical that these two terrorist suspects make the flight.
I've got nothin' in the book about new arrivals.
We're on lockdown.
There must be some mistake.
Really?
This is Fazad al-Hamaq, the Butcher of Kandahar.
[speaking another language]
- What about that one?
- That's, um...
Umal Hazan al-Abad.
[speaking another language]
Shut up!
Sir, these men are very dangerous.
I don't know...
What am I supposed to do... [explosion]
Holy shit!
Stow those men!
[music]
Oh my God, I'm freaking out!
It's too much open space.
I wanna go home!
Move it.
Move, move, move.
- I'm...
I'm having a hot flash!
- You do this one thing for me?
- I swear I will get you home.
Okay?
- Are you insane?
I'm in an orange freaking jump suit.
Talk about a target!
I'm Piggy in the goddamn Lord of The Flies!
I knew, I know what happens to guys like me!
I never should have agreed to come.
Stay calm.
All right?
I've got your back.
[music]
- It's a redundant fractal impedance lock.
- Okay, okay.
The, the, the mechanism has a chaotic rotation tumbler...
It's impossible to predict the combination of the day, unless you have a mind for numbers.
[music]
The key code fractal is nine times out of ten the sum of the squares of the reactance of the circuit, which is always expressed in ohms.
[heavy breathing]
Oh... kay, oh, ah.
[music]
Okay.
Cover the entrance.
Moz, you're with me.
- Alright.
- No, no, no.
You see someone you shoot him.
[music]
[gun shooting]
[high pitched ringing]
What's the hell is going on here?
It's the CIA no-touch torture technique.
It's by the book.
Max Vargas!
[music] [heavy breathing]
[gunshots] [music]
You came for me, you came for me.
We gotta get you out of here.
My friend!
Take me, take me too!
- I'm sorry...
I can't.
- What about me?
- I'm from Canada!
- We must take them with us.
- No.
- Please!
They deserve due process.
What happens here is... is inhuman!
He's right, man.
Han shot first!
Han shot first!
Han shot first!
Han shot first!
Betty, now would be a good time for diversion.
[music] [explosion] [music]
Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
- Let's go!
- Freeze!
[gunshots]
[music]
Han shot first!
We gotta go, we gotta go now!
Come on.
[gunshots] Wooo!
[laughs] Nice shot, but we gotta go, let's go!
[music]
Let's go!
[music]
Go, go, go, go!
[music]
- My friends...
- Don't give us that, Max...
- What do you mean?
- We're not your friends.
You betrayed us.
We've seen the contents of your locker, Vargas.
Or should we call you Verrier?
We know you're not who you claimed to be.
And we know you're on the take.
- You sold us out, Max.
- It's not like that, Betty.
Just think of what this money can do for the impoverished.
I may have made an unethical deal, but I made it for ethical reasons!
The world is much more complicated than you think it is.
There is no black and white!
I am a revolutionary.
And I believe everything they've told you all.
So who obeyed you of?
{*} There was a lot of money.
A lot of money.
I think you're the only who understand that, Betty. {*}
I don't know what he's talking about.
But Betty...
I still love you.
Forget it.
We won't get anything out of him tonight.
I'll take the first shift watching him, you run second.
All right.
Sir, just received news of a breakout in our Davenport rendition facility.
- Vargas escaped.
- Well, that seals it.
My legacy has just become a dog's breakfast.
Except that we also ve XIII on video aiding in the escape.
That sneaky bastard.
First he kills eighty-two in the Synequanon bombing.
Now he teams up with terrorists.
The press is gonna burn me alive, Reynolds.
Not exactly, sir.
Alright, then say what the hell are you talking about?
This could be spammed {*} workin' your advantage.
- How so?
- You remember the 2000 election?
Mmm, hanging chads.
Those were the good old days.
We're in a national crisis and now with... with XIII at large we have every justification to move national security to Red Alert, declare Martial Law, and legally a postpone the transfer of power.
- Postpone the transfer of power?
- Indefinitely.
Indefin... indefinitely.
[laughs]
This evening, during President Carrington's adress to the nation, {*} the rule of law was transferred to military authority.
By this order, due to our continuing state of emergency and our current and ongoing threat to National Security,
I have made the difficult decision to declare Martial Law.
God bless America.
Moz, we've known each other for many years, you know I love you like a brother.
Sorry for all that has happened.
It's okay, Max, but brothers don't lie to brothers.
I know.
I am guilty.
I hope that one day you can forgive me.
Then you, you can go to sleep if you wish.
I am, I am tired too.
Maybe we can, we can both sleep.
Nah.
I'm not gonna fall for that.
I have to watch you.
- I won't run.
- How do I know that?
I want to prove myself, earn your trust again.
- Sorry, Max.
- Okay, Moz.
Fair enough.
Fair enough... [yawns]
[music]
Operator, I'd like to make an overseas collect call.
The number is 01144-5551925201.
Yes I'll hold.
Answer.
Please.
Please.
It's me...
Verrier.
Yes.
I managed to escape.
No it's... it's a long story.
I need to be brought in.
No, I can't.
Can you send an extraction team?
I know where the girl is.
Yes, she's with him, and the black man.
No.
She's safe.
No.
I didn't talk.
You have to believe me.
Bring me in and I'll tell you everything.
Yes, I am outside the Barrier city, {*} I am in the phone booth on the corner of Allain Cure {*} and 65th Street.
It's just by the railyard.
[music]
What took you so long?
You!
[music]
Damn!
He was my best friend for years, man!
I loved the guy.
He promised he wouldn't leave...
Oh, he, that's nice, he promised.
Everywhere was quiet, everybody else was sleeping...
That's what it means to take shifts.
Sleeping right?
Some people sleep and others stay awake.
I know, I'm sorry.
I was tired!
Okay?
Voilá!
Sometimes I even surprise myself.
What, you did it?
Should your doppelganger contact you again, press the button on the side of the earwig three times, and hold down the last press...
It'll create a ping echo, which will act much like a homing device.
- Thanks, Barnabis.
- That's "Mr." Wizard to you, all right?
And listen, be careful, my man.
There are bad forces afoot.
All right?
Things are not as they seem, and if you go chasing them, you might just end up running down a rabbit hole.
You take care of yourself too.
- You too.
- Thanks.
[music]
Mierda!
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Unless you want to be at the center of an implosive force that will vaporize you.
Listen very carefully and follow my instructions if you want to live.
If you attempt to deactivate the device, you will detonate.
If you don't do as I say, you will detonate.
You understand?
Why... are you doing this to me?
Uh uh, I do the talking.
Good.
You'll find a compass and a security card in your right hand pocket.
Do not lose either.
Hold the compass up and head North.
[music]
In twenty feet, turn left then walk up the stairs.
Where am I?
Never mind that.
You're doing well, my friend.
[music]
Now, there's a door at the end of the stairs.
Use the security card to open it.
Make a left, proceed to the end of the hall.
[music]
This is a great and historic moment.
By endorsing the Carrington Accord, Nigeria accepts its responsibility, the responsibility it shares with every nation to protect our planet.
[music]
That's right.
Now.
Cross the room and go through the door directly in front of you.
You're almost there.
Swipe the card key again.
[music]
Enter the room.
It's almost over.
[music]
I do this action of my own free will...
Boooomb!
[explosion]
This morning a suicide bomber has gained entrance to the White House, injuring President Carrington and several other White House staff and claiming the life of Wole Madaki, President of Nigeria.
He killed the President of Nigeria.
...no one has immediately come forward to claim responsibility for the attack, the Department of Homeland
Security released a statement linking the attack to the
Synequanon bombing and Veil leader, Max Vargas.
We now go to News One White House correspondent, Bill Bartlett.
[phone beeping]
I thought you were too quiet.
Poor, poor Vargas, so close to getting away scot-free.
You're sick.
What did he ever do to you?
- What indeed.
- I'm coming after you, you deranged...
And then what?
You have no purpose, no reason.
You don't even have any friends or family, or a special someone to go home to.
Now I'm your only family.
So you be careful and don't insult the woman who gave us this face.
Go to hell.
I'm not your brother.
Oh, yes you are.
More than you know.
[throwing up]
She's sick, again.
Listen, I've found a trace on my double.
I'm going after him.
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no.
I have to do this alone.
And you better get moving, all right?
Get a new squat.
Whatever you do, just keep an eye on her, okay?
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- All right.
- All right?
- All right.
[music]
[music] [knocking]
You okay in there?
I'm fine.
You sure?
Yes.
I just need a few minutes.
It's gonna to be okay.
I'm gonna protect you.
Even if I tell you something you won't like?
Because I might be in trouble.
Moz?
- Congratulations!
- What?
If you don't want me to put a hole in daddy's head,
I'm gonna ask that you follow me.
I think it's his, the doubles.
He never ever loved you!
Max did.
- I did.
- I didn't ask for this.
He didn't care about you!
Okay, I have urgent business with the young lady, so if you don't mind.
[music]
Too bad we didn't meet under different circumstances.
Betty!
[music]
[ping rising]
[whack!
]
You're a handsome guy, you know that?
I've been ugly before, let me tell you, it sucks.
Yeah, I've been so many people.
I can't even remember who I used to be.
It took some time, but now,
I think I like being you more than you like being you.
To the end this time?
[music]
You think this started with you?
You think it's gonna end with me?
Aghh.
Hey, hey.
What did Jones whisper to you that night I popped her?
She told me, that she knew who you are.
[music]
[choking]
[music]
[music]
I told you...
it doesn't end with me.
[ship horn]
[music]
What was that?
Going somewhere, brother?
Listen.
You're not real.
Oh, I'm as real as you are.
Like hell you are.
I just killed you.
Then how do you explain me talking to you right now?
Programming.
You're just a voice planted in my head.
You shouldn't do this.
You hid that last Tesla letter on that ship.
And that's gonna lead me to whoever started this.
I wanna know what happened to me and why you're still inside my head.
I'm gonna find out who's responsible for givin' you my face and I'm gonna kill them!
You might not like what you'll find.
I'm finishing this.
I'm gonna take this to the end.
[music]
Then, bon voyage, brother.
Bon voyage.
[music]
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Just hold him still.
Bear, afliggen!
Sit.
Well, that was a big help.
So, you said we had another number?
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes, maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan 18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
Any threats?
Not that I can see, but some anomalies.
She dumped her phone five days ago and moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him.
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
You'll manage.
- Detective.
- Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry.
Got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
Did you know him?
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.
What's your interest?
I got a tip, anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Whoa.
Well, maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st was offing dealers and selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars or dead, but not all of them.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
I'll catch up with you later.
So, with HR degraded to the point of irrelevance, my team is shifting priorities back to the man in the suit.
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?
- Yes, of course.
- Good.
We have some new information, including who he's working for.
Now, the bureau has been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks, like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources, and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you, may also have been recruited, possibly by the man in the suit.
- Really?
Snow?
- Makes sense.
I mean, Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.
He catches him, and then the man in the suit flips him.
Gets snow to be his asset.
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified, so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.
And I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
So, please, think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
Thanks.
[Phone dialing]
Carter.
Hello, Detective.
I need to find our friend.
We have a big problem.
You'll find him at the department of city planning.
So he just downloaded the file and walked out?
Yeah.
Didn't anyone try to stop her?
Apparently nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
Uh, what do we got?
You heard the 10-31 too, Detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
Uh, like we were telling Marshal Jennings here...
Marshal Jennings, huh?
The manager called it in 'cause one of his staff, a girl by the name of Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
And walked out with it two hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Well, does anyone know what's on the file?
Well, we keep plans here for some important buildings, but all she walked out with were some engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
So, does anyone know where this Abby Monroe lives?
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
The phone number is a pay phone.
Hey, solid background check there.
What can I say?
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she was a flake.
Kids.
You never know.
Right, Detective?
Right.
Anyway, good job, following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
Thank you, Marshal.
Uh, look, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
[Whispers] John.
John!
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star?
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great, Carter.
Just flash a badge, and people tell you everything.
You gotta stop, John.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the man in the suit.
He has a new theory.
Yeah, that I'm working for China or something.
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher would be good for you too.
Long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll be hearing from me.
Okay.
All right, look.
We're gonna have to set some boundaries here.
Well, sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
Um, what's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking to see she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Carter, can you get me footage from that camera from about two hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
[Sighs]
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle, Detective?
No, because it was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.
I got the camera tapes out of the robbery squad.
I see the perp is a single male.
You looking at the footage now?
Yes.
Why?
No reason.
Blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms, 'cause he knew he'd be less than 30 seconds.
He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
Whoa.
That's impressive.
What is... what...
what is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too.
What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic, use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess, ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
The question is, what are they doing?
I don't think you're gonna like the answer.
Comp stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
The same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.
What was stolen?
Explosives.
Semtex.
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.
Let's see, theft of explosives, theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.
This guy could be the next Timothy McVeigh, and your girl is working with him.
He may have manipulated her into getting involved.
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55.
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Oh, yeah, sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
Or maybe he was on the take.
Did you hear me say that?
Don't know.
What are you saying?
Look, he was undercover narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts, a lot of money hanging around.
Anyway, why you want to know?
Ah, I just been seeing him around.
Yeah.
He's been hanging around Detective Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
Yeah.
I'm just saying, but the way
Abby went off the grid, cut all ties, she's planning something, Finch.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Well, her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism, which would be a relevant crime, the machine would have given her number to... to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine, but what leads do we have left, Finch?
We have two.
First, the pay phone number that she gave the temp agency.
It's a street corner in Queens.
The agency must have been able to contact her there at one point.
It might give you a clue as to where she's living.
Okay.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life for the last year...
The charity, Homes For Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check that one out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
You're in a good mood, Mr. Reese.
I am.
I woke up this morning and felt... it took me a while to put my finger on it, but I felt happy.
Must be this job.
Well, I'm glad.
[Bear barks]
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.
[Bear whines]
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
I think I've found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe, Abby's little brother.
I'm an old friend of Abby's family, and as I was visiting New York, they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left her job here.
She never told them?
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
- Fire her?
What on earth for?
- Stealing.
At first, it was just petty cash, and I let it go, thinking it was simple carelessness, but then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts, trying to move money around...
significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple, that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Well, unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal, and our donations would just dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was eight, that time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then, I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated and it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right, and I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him, and I know that he would be proud of me, just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you, and I hope you never have to see this.
Any idea why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
Uh, they'd talk when he came by the offices.
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby, 'cause, just about that time, she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry.
We have a strict confidentiality agreement with all of our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman, explosives ordinance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.
He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than two months.
Did they know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on, and his fiancee dumped him.
Must be why he went to Chapple... to ask for another loan.
However it happened, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, Detective.
[Phone beeps]
Finch, are you still there?
Yes.
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest...
low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped into my pocket as I was leaving.
And where is the transponder now?
It's on a laundry van with Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously, Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in, see what I can find.
When I said you need to get out more,
I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese, and Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
So, I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside, but the alarm has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
[Loud boom] Ah!
What was that?
Finch, get out now.
Who the hell are you?
Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same thing as you, I expect, and since you woke the whole building, we better hurry.
I'm on my way to you.
Please, just walk away now, Finch.
[Gasps] Shh!
- Who are you?
- It's okay.
- Let go of me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
Finch, get out now.
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.
Just get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Please don't do that.
Then get off of me.
Let me go.
[Door opens, closes]
Please, no guns.
[Groans]
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.
There they go!
Stop right there!
Get on, or they'll kill you!
Get on!
[Grunts]
[Gunfire]
Finch, are you okay?
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!
I'll be in touch!
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
Okay, you should leave now, because my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but yes, and he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him, but first things first.
What does that message to your mom and dad mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out, or I'm...
What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
No, but I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief, and I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that, even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother Josh.
But I was lucky.
I made it out.
- Mr, Reese?
- Yes, Finch.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No, especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
You know, Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
Whatever you're planning, I know why, Abby.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.
- By lending him money?
- Yes.
Chapple made him a loan.
The interest rates tripled in a year.
No one could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancee.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple, one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
Look, I went through Chapple's files.
I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds, hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
[Motorcycle approaching]
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors by way of a wireless link, so I cloned the link and reprogrammed it to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle, which was exhilarating, by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
Working late?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
[Laughs]
It's always something, you know?
Yeah.
Is something wrong, Carter?
Donnelly made me an offer today.
What, I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He, um, invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond, but think of the prospects, Carter, and the money.
You should do it.
But what about my kid?
I mean, it... it'll probably mean
I have to move out of New York.
You mean I'd never see you again?
[Laughs]
[Phone rings]
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Uh, now what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
[Over recording] It's Cal.
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
No problem.
I'm hoping you can help me out, Cal.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The Mayor has seen this crime spike in Crown Heights... drug busts, uh, burglaries, even homicides.
He wants me to find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
So, do you?
Crown Heights, yeah.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach till Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from the inside, working to take over the Heights.
Boo.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I'm keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
What are you doing?
None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
You're checking him out for Carter?
No, I've been wondering who else you've been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when you made that call to Carter, pointing her towards me in the Davidson murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
You know how many times I've heard that?
And here I am, beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I said, go home.
There's our cell phone trail.
It looks like Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business name on the block, cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank, Merton Watts.
Maybe he has an account there.
[Keys clacking]
Not according to his computer records.
- Then a safe deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, Chapple's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
If he's getting kickbacks from the banks...
You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
That means they handle all foreclosure sales.
And split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
Yes.
And for her brother.
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
So, how are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point and blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
[Static]
System's back up.
They get anything from the safe?
The box code and the keys.
But there's no way they can get into the vault at the bank, is there?
What do you think?
Police band says they stole explosives and engineering plans.
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
It's a big area to cover.
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on, Donnelly?
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for has some sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops?
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The man in the suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know if you'll accept the temporary assignment to the bureau.
Okay, yes.
Good.
You won't regret it.
So, we've been tracking this man for ten months.
Every time we get close, he slips right out from under us, as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead, and then I realized, the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I thought of that.
Cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs.
- Came up with nothing.
- Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from that night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found short bursts of a cloned IMEI with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.
24 hours ago, the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned imeis at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
Abby, this is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough, Abby.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
Now, the truth... or I take you to the cops myself.
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We want to give it back to the people he stole it from.
How?
We haven't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought very far at all.
Now, why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
Abby did.
She went to the DA, but Chapple got there first, spread his poison.
The DA even threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he would come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there?
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.
John, this has gone far enough.
Has it, Finch?
Yes.
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them, Finch.
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
Besides, I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
John, it's far too risky.
What did you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
[Subway train roars through tunnel]
Now.
[Loud boom]
[Coughs]
This is where the safe deposit boxes are.
We realized we couldn't get to them from inside the bank, so we decided to bring them to us.
You're gonna blow the roof.
We got something here.
John, what's your situation?
Ten more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
No, it's a broad spectrum sweep, heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line and please get out now.
If Shayn and Abby won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people, and they're bringing down a very bad man.
Now, isn't that what your experiment's all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
Five minutes and we're out.
[Subway train roars through tunnel]
In three, two, one.
[Loud boom]
Let's go.
There, 158.
[Grunts]
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
- Is this what you need?
- Is it ever.
There's more than $30 million here.
His charity stole $30 million.
Then let's go, back the way we came.
[Gunshot] Get down!
- You okay?
- Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We've got to get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
We're tracking IMEI bursts in the same area.
It's him.
Now, we hook up a SWAT en route.
- Are you with us?
- Uh, yeah, of course.
I just need to make a phone call.
All right, make it quick.
[Phone dialing]
Hi, mom, can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
Mom?
You been drinking, Carter?
Tell Harold, Donnelly is headed to Wall Street.
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phones.
Okay, mom.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
[Engine starts]
[Siren walls]
Hey, it's Fusco.
Wherever wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street, because that's where Donnelly's heading.
That's exactly where John is.
Merton Watts Investment Bank, Hanover Street.
Yeah, plus Carter said something about him being up on your phones.
Just as I feared.
Anything you can do to run interference for us at the bank, Detective, I would be most grateful.
[Bear whimpers]
I take it you know this gentleman?
Peter Yogorov, enforcer for the Russian mob.
Least he used to be until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov's at MCC, awaiting trial with his little brother Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all spartan on our emissaries,
Elias has made it clear...
that relationship is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians?
Open negotiations?
They have all the right pieces, but with us behind them, cash flow would no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
Looks like that pain-in-the-ass Donnelly finally caught up with the man in the suit.
Not even 7:00 AM, and already a perfect day.
The bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
[Gunfire]
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
[Gunfire]
I hate to say this, Finch, but we're in a bit of a pickle here.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're gonna dress up like bankers.
We're gonna climb up there and walk right out the front door.
Come on.
[Siren walls]
Base just picked up another burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
So, you can track him, but you can't hear what he's saying?
Do you know who he's talking to?
Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
Now, when you get up to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
[Grunts]
[Siren walls]
Looks like nothing's going on inside.
No, the signal's still active, and the 911 call said the explosion was underground, remember?
He's in there.
All right, one team in front with me, second team, around the back.
We move in 30.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Hello.
Here.
Take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Everybody back against the wall!
- Stay where you are!
- Don't move!
- Hands up!
- See your hands!
Foyer's secure.
Check every ID.
No one leaves.
Half your men here, half with me.
Yes, sir.
Let's go!
Hands where we can see them!
You!
Don't move!
- See your ID, please?
- John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.
[Phone dialing]
We got company.
Lose the weapons and get the hell out.
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.
Blew out the damn floor.
Alpha, this is Delta.
Vault level is secure.
I'm not gonna make it, Harold.
Sorry I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So, thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
John?

You are being watched.
The government has a secret system.
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You'll never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
Behind the Government Team presents
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Just hold him still.
Bear, afliggen!
Sit.
That was a big help.
So, you said we had another number?
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes, maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan
18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
- Any threats?
- Not that I can see, but some anomalies.
She dumped her phone five days ago and moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him.
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
- Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
- You'll manage.
Detective.
Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry.
Got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
Did you know him?
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.
- What's your interest?
- I got a tip, anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st was offing dealers and selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars or dead, but not all of them.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
I'll catch up with you later.
So, with HR degraded to the point of irrelevance, my team is shifting priorities back to the man in the suit.
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?
- Yes, of course.
- Good.
We have some new information, including who he's working for.
Now, the bureau has been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks, like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources, and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you, may also have been recruited, possibly by the man in the suit.
- Really?
Snow?
- Makes sense.
Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.
He catches him, and then the man in the suit flips him.
Gets snow to be his asset.
Listen, I want to read you into this, but it's classified, so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.
And I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
So, please, think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
- Hello, Detective.
- I need to find our friend.
We have a big problem.
You'll find him at the department of city planning.
So he just downloaded the file and walked out?
Didn't anyone try to stop her?
Apparently nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
What do we got?
You heard the 10-31 too, Detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
Like we were telling Marshal Jennings here...
Marshal Jennings, huh?
The manager called it in 'cause one of his staff, a girl, Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
And walked out with it two hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Does anyone know what's on the file?
We keep plans here for some important buildings, but all she walked out with were some engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
So, does anyone know where this Abby Monroe lives?
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
The phone number is a pay phone.
Solid background check there.
What can I say?
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she was a flake.
Kids.
You never know.
Right?
Right.
Anyway, good job, following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
Thank you, Marshal.
Look, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star?
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great, Carter.
Just flash a badge, and people tell you everything.
You gotta stop.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the man in the suit.
He has a new theory.
Yeah, that I'm working for China or something.
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher would be good for you too.
Long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll be hearing from me.
All right, look.
We're gonna have to set some boundaries here.
Well, sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
What's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking to see she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Can you get me footage from that camera from about 2 hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle?
No, because it was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.
I got the camera tapes out of the robbery squad.
I see the perp is a single male.
You looking at the footage now?
- Yes.
Why?
- No reason.
Blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms, 'cause he knew he'd be less than 30 s.
He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
That's impressive.
What is...
What is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too.
What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic, use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess, ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
The question is, what are they doing?
I don't think you're gonna like the answer.
Comp stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
The same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.
- What was stolen?
- Explosives.
Semtex.
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.
Let's see, theft of explosives, theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.
This guy could be the next McVeigh, and your girl is working with him.
He may have manipulated her into getting involved.
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55.
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
Or maybe he was on the take.
- Did you hear me say that?
- Don't know.
What are you saying?
Look, he was undercover narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts, a lot of money hanging around.
- Anyway, why you want to know?
- I just been seeing him around.
He's been hanging around Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
I'm just saying, but the way Abby went off the grid, cut all ties, she's planning something.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism, which would be a relevant crime, the machine would have given her number to... to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine, but what leads do we have left?
We have two.
First, the pay phone number that she gave the temp agency.
It's a street corner in Queens.
The agency must have been able to contact her there at one point.
It might give you where she's living.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life for the last year the charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check that one out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
- You're in a good mood.
- I am.
I woke up this morning and felt... it took me a while to put my finger on it, but I felt happy.
Must be this job.
Well, I'm glad.
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
I think I've found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe, Abby's little brother.
I'm an old friend of Abby's family, and as I was visiting New York, they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left her job here.
She never told them?
I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
Fire her?
- What on earth for?
- Stealing.
At first, it was just petty cash, and I let it go, thinking it was simple carelessness, but then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts, trying to move money around... significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple, that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal, and our donations would just dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was eight, that time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then, I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated and it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right, and I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him, and I know that he would be proud of me,
just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you, and I hope you never have to see this.
Any idea why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
They'd talk when he came by the offices.
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby, because, just about that time, she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry.
We have a confidentiality agreement with all of our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman, explosives ordinance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.
He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than two months.
Did they know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on, and his fiancee dumped him.
Must be why he went to Chapple... to ask for another loan.
However it happened, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, Detective.
Are you still there?
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest...
low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped into my pocket as I was leaving.
And where is the transponder now?
It's on a laundry van with Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously, Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in, see what I can find.
When I said you need to get out more, I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese, and Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
So, I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside, but the alarm
has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
What was that?
Finch, get out now.
Who are you?
Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same thing as you, I expect, and since you woke the whole building, we better hurry.
I'm on my way to you.
Please, just walk away now, Finch.
Who are you?
Let go of me!
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Finch, get out now.
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.
Get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Please don't do that.
Then get off of me.
Let me go.
Please, no guns.
Talk to me.
- What's happening?
- The situation is evolving.
There they go!
Stop right there!
Get on, or they'll kill you!
Get on!
Are you okay?
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!
I'll be in touch!
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
You should leave now, because my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but yes, and he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him, but first things first.
What does that message to your parents mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out...
- or I'm...
- What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
But I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief, and I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that, even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother Josh.
But I was lucky.
I made it out.
Yes.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No, especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
You know, Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
Whatever you're planning, I know why, Abby.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.
By lending him money?
Chapple made him a loan.
The interest rates tripled in a year.
No one could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancee.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple, one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
Look, I went through Chapple's files.
I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds, hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors by way of a wireless link, so I cloned the link and reprogrammed it to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle, which was exhilarating, by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
Working late?
It's always something, you know?
Yeah.
Is something wrong, Carter?
- Donnelly made me an offer today.
- What, I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, small fish in a big pond, but think of the prospects, and the money.
You should do it.
But what about my kid?
It'll probably mean I have to move out of New York.
You mean I'd never see you again?
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Now what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
It's Cal.
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
No problem.
You can help me out.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The Mayor has seen this crime spike in Crown Heights.
Drug busts, burglaries, even homicides.
I must find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
So, do you?
Crown Heights.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach till Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from the inside, working to take over the Heights.
What are you doing here?
I'm keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
- What are you doing?
- None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
You're checking him out for Carter?
Who else you've been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when youcall to Carter, pointing her towards me in the Davidson murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
How many times I've heard that?
And here I am, beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here?
I said, go home.
There's our cell phone trail.
It looks like Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business name on the block, cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank, Merton Watts.
He has an account there.
Not according to his computer records.
- Then a safe deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, Chapple's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
- He's getting kickbacks from the banks.
- You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
That means they handle all foreclosure sales.
Split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
Yes.
And for her brother.
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
How are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point and blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
System's back up.
- They get anything from the safe?
- The box code and the keys.
There's no way they can get into the vault at the bank?
What do you think?
Police band saysthey stole explosives and engineering plans.
Get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
- It's a big area to cover.
- Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on?
I think the organization our man works for has some sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops?
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The man in the suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know if you'll accept the temporary assignment to the bureau.
Good.
You won't regret it.
We've been tracking this man for ten months.
Every time we get close, he slips right out from under us, as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead, and then I realized, the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I thought, Cross-checked crime scenes, he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs.
- Came up with nothing.
- Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from that night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found short bursts of a cloned IMEI with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.
24 hours ago, the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned IMEIs at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
This is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
The truth... or I take you to the cops myself.
You're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We want to give it back to the people he stole it from.
We haven't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought very far at all.
- Why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
- Abby did.
She went to the DA, but Chapple got there first, spread his poison.
The DA even threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he would come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there?
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.
- This has gone far enough.
- Has it, Finch?
Yes.
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them.
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
- It's far too risky.
- What did you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
This is where the safe deposit boxes are.
We realized we couldn't get to them from inside the bank, we decided to bring them to us.
You're gonna blow the roof.
We got something here.
- John, what's your situation?
- Ten more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
No.
It's a broad spectrum sweep, heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line and please get out now.
If they won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people, and they're bringing down a very bad man.
Now, isn't that what your experiment's all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
Five minutes and we're out.
Let's go.
There, 158.
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
- Is this what you need?
- This is.
There's more than $30 million here.
His charity stole $30 million.
Then let's go, back the way we came.
- You okay?
- Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We've got to get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
We're tracking IMEI bursts in the same area.
It's him.
We hook up a SWAT.
- Are you with us?
- Of course.
- I just need to make a phone call.
- Make it quick.
Can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
You been drinking?
Tell Harold, Donnelly is headed to Wall Street.
He's tracking the phones.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
I hope it's not near Wall Street, that's where Donnelly's heading.
That's where John is.
Merton Watts Investment Bank, Hanover Street.
Carter said something about him being up on your phones.
As I feared.
You can do to run interference for us at the bank, Detective.
I would be most grateful.
I take it you know this gentleman?
Peter Yogorov, enforcer for the Russian mob.
Least he used to be until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov's at MCC, awaiting trial with his little brother Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all spartan on our emissaries,
Elias has made it clear that relationship is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians?
Open negotiations?
They have all the right pieces, but with us behind them, cash flow would no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
Looks like that pain-in-the-ass Donnelly finally caught up with the man in the suit.
Not even 7:00 AM, and already a perfect day.
The bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
What's happening?
I hate to say this but we're in a bit of a pickle here.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're gonna dress up like bankers.
We're gonna climb up there and walk right out the front door.
Come on.
Base picked up another burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
You can't hear what he's saying?
- Do you know who he's talking to?
- Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
Now, when you get up to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
Looks like nothing's going on.
The signal's still active and the 911 call said the explosion was underground.
He's in there.
One team in front with me, second team, around the back.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Here.
Take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Everybody back against the wall!
Stay where you are!
- Hands up!
- See your hands!
Foyer's secure.
Check every ID.
No one leaves.
Half your men here, half with me.
Yes, sir.
Hands where we can see them!
You!
Don't move!
John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank, get out now.
We got company.
Lose the weapons and get the hell out.
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.
Blew out the damn floor.
This is Delta.
Vault level is secure.
I'm not gonna make it.
Sorry I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So, thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
ID?
Harold Wren, Universal Heritage Insurance.
My associates.
Why are you in the bank?
We have a meeting with the vice president of Corporate Strategy.
Did you get what you wanted?
All the money Chapple stole.
More than $30 million.
Can you do anything with the accounts?
I'll empty them, deposit every last cent into the accounts of reputable military charities.
Would that do?
Then I have to get you out of here and out of this state.
As we're together.
Check the top level.
Check down back.
Don't worry.
I got you covered.
What about John?
We finally got you.
Sir, there's a problem.
Step back.
Do you recognize him?
No.
Cuff 'em all.
FINCH:
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system.
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
ABBY:
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good.
Keep the rules.
Now I'm going to break them in a big way.
FINCH:
Just hold him still.
REESE:
Bear, afleggen.
- Sit.
- Well, that was a big help.
REESE:
You said we had a number?
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity, Homes for Our Returning Heroes.
Maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan 18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
- Any threats?
- Not that I can see.
But some anomalies.
She dumped her phone five days ago, moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him.
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
You'll manage.
Detective.
Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry, I got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
You know him?
Know him?
Had some run-ins with him.
What's your interest?
I got a tip, anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Whoa.
Maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st that was offing dealers, selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars, or dead, but not all.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
CARTER:
I'll catch up with you later.
With HR degraded to the point of irrelevance my team is shifting priorities back to the Man in the Suit.
He's still out there.
You still wanna catch him?
Yes, of course.
Good.
We have new information.
Including who he's working for.
The Bureau's been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks.
Like the CIA or Ml6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you may also have been recruited.
Possibly by the Man in the Suit.
Really?
Snow?
It makes sense.
Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA he catches him, then the Man in the Suit flips him.
Gets Snow to be his asset.
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified.
I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the Bureau.
I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
Please think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
Thanks.
- Carter.
FINCH:
Hello, detective.
I need to find our friend.
[OVER PHONE] We have a big problem.
FINCH:
You'll find him at the Department of City Planning.
REESE:
So she just downloaded the file and walked out?
Yeah.
REESE:
Didn't anyone try to stop her?
OFFICER 1:
Apparently, nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
What have we got?
You heard the 10-31 too, detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
Uh, like we were telling Marshal Jennings here...
CARTER:
Marshal Jennings, huh?
OFFICER 2:
The manager called it in because one of his staff Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
Walked out with it two hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Anyone know what's on the file?
We keep plans for important buildings.
All she took were engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover, near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
Anyone know where Abby Monroe lives?
OFFICER 1:
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
Phone number is a pay phone.
Hey, solid background check, there.
What can I say?
She seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she's a flake.
Kids.
You never know, right, detective?
Right.
Anyway, good job following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
MANAGER:
Thank you, marshal.
Uh, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
John.
John?
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star.
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great.
Flash a badge, people tell you everything.
You gotta stop.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the Man in the Suit.
He has a new theory.
That I'm working for China or something?
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher's good for you too.
Long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll hear from me.
Okay.
Look, we're going to have to set some boundaries here.
Sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
What's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Can you get me footage from that camera?
From about two hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle, detective?
No.
It was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.
Got the camera tapes out of the Robbery Squad.
Let's see.
The perp is a single male...
You looking at the footage now?
- Yes.
Why?
FINCH:
No reason.
CARTER:
He blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms because he knew it would be less than 30 seconds.
[OVER PHONE] He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
Whoa.
That's impressive.
What?
What is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too?
[OVER PHONE] What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic.
Use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess?
Ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
Question is, what are they doing?
CARTER:
You're not gonna like the answer.
Comp Stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
Same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.
- What was stolen?
REESE:
Explosives.
- Semtex.
CARTER:
Twenty pounds of it.
And blasting caps.
Theft of explosives theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.
He could be the next Timothy McVeigh.
And your girl is working with him.
Maybe he manipulated her into getting involved.
CARTER:
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
You work at the 55.
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
- Or maybe he was on the take.
- Did I say that?
What are you saying?
He was undercover Narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts a lot of money hanging around.
Anyway, why you wanna know?
I've just been seeing him around.
He's been hanging around Detective Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
The way Abby went off the grid, cut all ties she's planning something.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism...
Which would be a relevant crime.
- The machine would have given her number to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine.
But what leads do we have left?
We have two.
First, the pay phone number she gave the temp agency.
A street corner in Queens.
The agency must have been able to contact her there.
Might give you a clue where she's living.
Okay.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life, the charity.
Homes for Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check it out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
You're in a good mood.
I woke up this morning and felt...
Took me a while to put my finger on it.
- I felt happy.
Must be this job.
I'm glad.
[BEAR BARKS]
Sorry, Bear, not now.
[WHIMPERS]
REESE:
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
Think I found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe.
Abby's little brother.
FINCH:
I'm an old friend of Abby's family.
As I was visiting New York, they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left herjob here.
She never told them?
I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
Fire her?
What on earth for?
Stealing.
At first it was just petty cash and I let it go thinking it was simple carelessness.
But then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts trying to move money around, significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple, that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal and our donations would dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
If you're watching this you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was 8, ha.
That time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then I've always tried to be good.
Keep the rules.
But now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated, and it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right.
And I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him, and I know he'd be proud of me.
Just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you.
And I hope you never have to see this.
FINCH:
Any idea why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
They'd talk when he came by the offices.
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby because just about that time, she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry, we have a strict confidentiality agreement with all our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman.
Explosives ordnance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.
[OVER PHONE] He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than two months.
They know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on, and his fiancee dumped him.
REESE:
Must be why he went to Chapple to ask for another loan.
CARTER:
However it happened, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, detective.
Finch?
You still there?
Yes.
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.
REESE:
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest.
Low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped in my pocket as I was leaving.
REESE:
Where's the transponder now?
On a laundry van with New Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in.
REESE:
When I said you need to get out more, I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese.
And Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside.
The alarm has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
[BANGING]
What was that?
Finch, get out now!
- Who the hell are you?
- Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same as you, and since you've woke the whole building, we'd better hurry.
I'm on my way.
Please just walk away now, Finch.
- Aah!
REESE:
Shh.
- Who are you?
Let go of me!
REESE:
It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you.
REESE:
Finch, get out now.
I've got Abby.
Just get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Please don't do that.
Then get off me.
Let me go.
Please, no guns.
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.
There they go.
MAN:
Stop right there!
Get on or they'll kill you!
Get on!
Finch, are you okay?
FINCH:
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally I'm fine.
I'll be in touch.
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
Okay, you should leave now.
My boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but, yes.
And he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him.
But first, what does that message to your mom and dad mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out!
- Or I'm...
- What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
No, but I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief.
And I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that, even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother, Josh.
But I was lucky, I made it out.
FINCH:
Mr. Reese?
Yes, Finch.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No.
Especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
REESE:
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
REESE:
Whatever you're planning, I know why.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.
By lending him money?
Yes.
Chapple made him a loan, and the interest rates tripled in a year.
No one could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancee.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
I went through Chapple's files, I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds, hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
[FINCH PANTING]
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors via a wireless link.
So I cloned the link and reprogrammed it to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
REESE:
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle.
Which was exhilarating, by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
BEECHER:
You working late?
Uh, yeah.
Um, heh, it's always something, you know?
BEECHER:
Yeah.
Something wrong, Carter?
Donnelly made me an offer today.
I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He, um, invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond.
But think of the prospects.
And the money.
You should do it.
What about my kid?
It will probably mean I have to move out of New York.
- You mean I'd never see you again?
- Ha, ha.
[PHONE RINGS]
BEECHER:
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Uh, what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
BEECHER:
It's Cal.
QUINN:
Cal?
Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tidal Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
BEECHER:
No problem.
I'm hoping you can help me out.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The mayor's seen this crime spike in Crown Heights.
Drug busts, burglaries, even homicides.
He wants me to find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
Do you?
Crown Heights.
Yeah.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach until Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from inside.
Working to take over the Heights.
SIMMONS:
Boo.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
Keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
What are you doing?
None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
Checking him out for Carter.
No, I been wondering who else you been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when you called Carter.
Pointing her towards me in Davidson's murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
Know how many times I've heard that?
But here I am, beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I said, go home.
FINCH:
There's our cell phone trail.
Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business on the block.
Cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank, Merton Watts.
Maybe he has an account there.
Not according to his computer records.
- A safe-deposit box?
FINCH:
What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, he's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
If he's getting kickbacks from the banks...
You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
They handle all foreclosure sales.
Split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe-deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
REESE:
Yes.
And for her brother.
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
So how are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point, then blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
System's back up.
They get anything from the safe?
The box code and the keys.
There's no way they can get into the vault, is there?
What do you think?
They stole explosives and engineering plans.
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
It's a big area to cover.
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
DONNELLY:
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on, Donnelly?
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for has some sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops.
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The Man in the Suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know if you'll accept the temporary assignment with the Bureau.
Okay, yes.
Good.
You won't regret it.
So we've been tracking this man for 10 months.
Every time we get close, he slips out from under us as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead.
And then I realized, the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I've cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs, came up with nothing.
Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from the night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found bursts of a cloned IMEl with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.
Twenty-four hours ago the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned IMEIs at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
Abby, this is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough, Abby.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
REESE:
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
Now, the truth.
Or I take you to the cops myself.
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We wanna give it back to the people he stole from.
How?
We haven't thought that far ahead.
REESE:
You haven't thought very far at all.
Why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
Abby did.
She went to the DA.
But Chapple got their first, spread his poison.
The DA threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he'd come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there.
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.
John, this has gone far enough.
Has it, Finch?
FINCH:
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them, Finch.
They tried the law, the law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
Besides, I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
John, it's far too risky.
What'd you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
Now.
This is where the safe-deposit boxes are.
SHAYN:
We couldn't get to them from inside the bank, so we decided to bring them to us.
You're going to blow the roof.
We got something here.
FINCH:
John, what's your situation?
Ten more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
FINCH:
No.
It's a broad-spectrum sweep.
Heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line, and, please, get out now.
If Abby and Shayn won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people.
And they're bringing down a very bad man.
Isn't that what your experiment is all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
Five minutes and we're out.
In three, two, one.
Let's go.
There, 158.
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
- Is this what you need?
ABBY:
Is it ever.
There's more than 30 million here.
His charity stole 30 million.
Then let's go.
Back the way we came.
Get down.
You okay?
Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We gotta get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
Tracking IMEl bursts in the same area.
It's him.
We hook up with SWAT en route.
You with us?
- Of course, I just need to make a phone call.
- Make it quick.
Hi, Mom.
Can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
You been drinking, Carter?
Tell Harold Donnelly's headed to Wall Street.
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phone.
Okay, Mom.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
Wherever Wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street.
That's where Donnelly's heading.
That's where John is.
Merton Watts Investment bank, Hanover Street.
Plus, Carter said he's up on your phones.
As I feared.
Anything you can do to run interference for us at the bank I would be most grateful.
QUINN:
I take it you know this gentleman.
SIMMONS:
Pete Yogorov, enforcer for the Russian mob.
At least he used to be, until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov is at MCC awaiting trial with his little brother, Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all Spartan on our emissaries Elias has made it clear.
That relationship is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians, open negotiation?
They have all the right pieces, but with us behind them cash flow will no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
That pain in the ass, Donnelly, finally caught up with the Man in the Suit.
Not even 7 a.m. And already a perfect day.
Bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
Mr. Reese?
What's happening?
Hate to say this, but we're in a bit of a pickle.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're going to dress up like bankers.
We're going to climb up there and walk right out the front door.
[SIRENS WAILING]
Base picked up a burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
You can track him, but you can't hear what he's saying?
Do you know who he's talking to?
Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
When you get to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
[GRUNTS]
Next, please.
- Looks like nothing's going on inside.
- Signal's still active.
The 911 call said the explosion was underground.
He's in there.
One team in front, second team around the back.
We move in 30.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I am a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Hello.
Here, take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Please back against the wall!
- Stay where you are.
SWAT 1:
Don't move!
Hands up!
SWAT 2:
See your hands.
SERGEANT:
Foyer's secure.
- Check every ID.
No one leaves.
- Half your men here, half with me.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go!
SWAT 1:
You, don't move.
SWAT 2:
See your ID, please?
John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.
We got company.
Lose your weapons and get the hell out.
FINCH:
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.
SWAT 3:
This is Delta.
Vault level secure.
Not going to make it, Harold.
[OVER PHONE] Sorry.
I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
John?
SWAT 4:
ID?
Harold Wren.
Universal Heritage Insurance.
My associates.
Why are you in the bank?
We have a meeting with the VP of Corporate Strategy.
AGENT:
Your ID.
FINCH:
Did you get what you wanted?
All the money Chapple stole.
More than 30 million.
Can you do anything with the accounts?
Yes.
I'll empty them.
Deposit every last cent in the accounts of reputable military charities.
Will that do?
Then I have to get you out of here and out of this state.
As long as we're together.
Check the top level.
Check down back.
Don't worry, I got you covered.
What about John?
We finally got you.
SWAT 1:
Sir.
There's a problem.
Step back.
Well, do you recognize him?
Uh...
No.
[SIGHS]
Cuff them all.
[English
- US
- SDH]
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Just hold him still.
Bear, afliggen!
Sit.
Well, that was a big help.
So, you said we had another number?
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes, maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan 18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
Any threats?
Not that I can see, but some anomalies.
She dumped her phone five days ago and moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him.
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
You'll manage.
- Detective.
- Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry.
Got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
Did you know him?
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.
What's your interest?
I got a tip, anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Well, maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st was offing dealers and selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars or dead, but not all of them.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
I'll catch up with you later.
So, with HR degraded to the point of irrelevance, my team is shifting priorities back to the man in the suit.
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?
- Yes, of course.
- Good.
We have some new information, including who he's working for.
Now, the bureau has been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks, like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources, and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you, may also have been recruited, possibly by the man in the suit.
- Really?
Snow?
- Makes sense.
I mean, Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.
He catches him, and then the man in the suit flips him.
Gets snow to be his asset.
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified, so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.
And I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
So, please, think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Carter.
Hello, Detective.
I need to find our friend.
We have a big problem.
You'll find him at the department of city planning.
So he just downloaded the file and walked out?
Yeah.
Didn't anyone try to stop her?
Apparently nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
Uh, what do we got?
You heard the 10-31 too, Detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
Uh, like we were telling Marshal Jennings here...
Marshal Jennings, huh?
The manager called it in 'cause one of his staff, a girl by the name of Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
And walked out with it two hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Well, does anyone know what's on the file?
Well, we keep plans here for some important buildings, but all she walked out with were some engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
So, does anyone know where this Abby Monroe lives?
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
The phone number is a pay phone.
Hey, solid background check there.
What can I say?
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she was a flake.
Kids.
You never know.
Right, Detective?
Right.
Anyway, good job, following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
Thank you, Marshal.
Uh, look, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
John.
John!
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star?
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great, Carter.
Just flash a badge, and people tell you everything.
You gotta stop, John.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the man in the suit.
He has a new theory.
Yeah, that I'm working for China or something.
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher would be good for you too.
Long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll be hearing from me.
Okay.
All right, look.
We're gonna have to set some boundaries here.
Well, sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
Um, what's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking to see she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Carter, can you get me footage from that camera from about two hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle, Detective?
No, because it was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.
I got the camera tapes out of the robbery squad.
I see the perp is a single male.
You looking at the footage now?
Yes.
Why?
No reason.
Blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms, 'cause he knew he'd be less than 30 seconds.
He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
That's impressive.
What is... what...
what is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too.
What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic, use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess, ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
The question is, what are they doing?
I don't think you're gonna like the answer.
Comp stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
The same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.
What was stolen?
Explosives.
Semtex.
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.
Let's see, theft of explosives, theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.
This guy could be the next Timothy McVeigh, and your girl is working with him.
He may have manipulated her into getting involved.
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55.
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Oh, yeah, sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
Or maybe he was on the take.
Did you hear me say that?
Don't know.
What are you saying?
Look, he was undercover narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts, a lot of money hanging around.
Anyway, why you want to know?
Ah, I just been seeing him around.
Yeah.
He's been hanging around Detective Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
Yeah.
I'm just saying, but the way
Abby went off the grid, cut all ties, she's planning something, Finch.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Well, her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism, which would be a relevant crime, the machine would have given her number to... to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine, but what leads do we have left, Finch?
We have two.
First, the pay phone number that she gave the temp agency.
It's a street corner in Queens.
The agency must have been able to contact her there at one point.
It might give you a clue as to where she's living.
Okay.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life for the last year...
The charity, Homes For Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check that one out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
You're in a good mood, Mr. Reese.
I am.
I woke up this morning and felt... it took me a while to put my finger on it, but I felt happy.
Must be this job.
Well, I'm glad.
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
I think I've found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe, Abby's little brother.
I'm an old friend of Abby's family, and as I was visiting New York, they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left her job here.
She never told them?
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
- Fire her?
What on earth for?
- Stealing.
At first, it was just petty cash, and I let it go, thinking it was simple carelessness, but then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts, trying to move money around...
significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple, that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Well, unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal, and our donations would just dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was eight, that time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then, I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated and it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right, and I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him, and I know that he would be proud of me, just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you, and I hope you never have to see this.
Any idea why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
Uh, they'd talk when he came by the offices.
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby, 'cause, just about that time, she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry.
We have a strict confidentiality agreement with all of our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman, explosives ordinance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.
He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than two months.
Did they know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on, and his fiancee dumped him.
Must be why he went to Chapple... to ask for another loan.
However it happened, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, Detective.
Finch, are you still there?
Yes.
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest...
low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped into my pocket as I was leaving.
And where is the transponder now?
It's on a laundry van with Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously, Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in, see what I can find.
When I said you need to get out more,
I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese, and Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
So, I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside, but the alarm has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
What was that?
Finch, get out now.
Who the hell are you?
Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same thing as you, I expect, and since you woke the whole building, we better hurry.
I'm on my way to you.
Please, just walk away now, Finch.
- Who are you?
- It's okay.
- Let go of me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
Finch, get out now.
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.
Just get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Please don't do that.
Then get off of me.
Let me go.
Please, no guns.
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.
There they go!
Stop right there!
Get on, or they'll kill you!
Get on!
Finch, are you okay?
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!
I'll be in touch!
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
Okay, you should leave now, because my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but yes, and he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him, but first things first.
What does that message to your mom and dad mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out, or I'm...
What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
No, but I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief, and I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that, even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother Josh.
But I was lucky.
I made it out.
- Mr, Reese?
- Yes, Finch.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No, especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
You know, Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
Whatever you're planning, I know why, Abby.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.
- By lending him money?
- Yes.
Chapple made him a loan.
The interest rates tripled in a year.
No one could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancee.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple, one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
Look, I went through Chapple's files.
I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds, hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors by way of a wireless link, so I cloned the link and reprogrammed it to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle, which was exhilarating, by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
Working late?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
It's always something, you know?
Yeah.
Is something wrong, Carter?
Donnelly made me an offer today.
What, I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He, um, invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond, but think of the prospects, Carter, and the money.
You should do it.
But what about my kid?
I mean, it... it'll probably mean
I have to move out of New York.
You mean I'd never see you again?
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Uh, now what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
It's Cal.
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
No problem.
I'm hoping you can help me out, Cal.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The Mayor has seen this crime spike in Crown Heights... drug busts, uh, burglaries, even homicides.
He wants me to find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
So, do you?
Crown Heights, yeah.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach till Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from the inside, working to take over the Heights.
Boo.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I'm keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
What are you doing?
None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
You're checking him out for Carter?
No, I've been wondering who else you've been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when you made that call to Carter, pointing her towards me in the Davidson murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
You know how many times I've heard that?
And here I am, beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I said, go home.
There's our cell phone trail.
It looks like Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business name on the block, cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank, Merton Watts.
Maybe he has an account there.
Not according to his computer records.
- Then a safe deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, Chapple's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
If he's getting kickbacks from the banks...
You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
That means they handle all foreclosure sales.
And split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
Yes.
And for her brother.
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
So, how are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point and blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
System's back up.
They get anything from the safe?
The box code and the keys.
But there's no way they can get into the vault at the bank, is there?
What do you think?
Police band says they stole explosives and engineering plans.
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
It's a big area to cover.
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on, Donnelly?
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for has some sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops?
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The man in the suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know if you'll accept the temporary assignment to the bureau.
Okay, yes.
Good.
You won't regret it.
So, we've been tracking this man for ten months.
Every time we get close, he slips right out from under us, as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead, and then I realized, the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I thought of that.
Cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs.
- Came up with nothing.
- Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from that night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found short bursts of a cloned IMEI with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.
24 hours ago, the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned imeis at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
Abby, this is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough, Abby.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
Now, the truth... or I take you to the cops myself.
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We want to give it back to the people he stole it from.
How?
We haven't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought very far at all.
Now, why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
Abby did.
She went to the DA, but Chapple got there first, spread his poison.
The DA even threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he would come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there?
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.
John, this has gone far enough.
Has it, Finch?
Yes.
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them, Finch.
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
Besides, I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
John, it's far too risky.
What did you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
Now.
This is where the safe deposit boxes are.
We realized we couldn't get to them from inside the bank, so we decided to bring them to us.
You're gonna blow the roof.
We got something here.
John, what's your situation?
Ten more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
No, it's a broad spectrum sweep, heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line and please get out now.
If Shayn and Abby won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people, and they're bringing down a very bad man.
Now, isn't that what your experiment's all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
Five minutes and we're out.
In three, two, one.
Let's go.
There, 158.
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
- Is this what you need?
- Is it ever.
There's more than $30 million here.
His charity stole $30 million.
Then let's go, back the way we came.
Get down!
- You okay?
- Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We've got to get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
We're tracking IMEI bursts in the same area.
It's him.
Now, we hook up a SWAT en route.
- Are you with us?
- Uh, yeah, of course.
I just need to make a phone call.
All right, make it quick.
Hi, mom, can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
Mom?
You been drinking, Carter?
Tell Harold, Donnelly is headed to Wall Street.
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phones.
Okay, mom.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
Hey, it's Fusco.
Wherever wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street, because that's where Donnelly's heading.
That's exactly where John is.
Merton Watts Investment Bank, Hanover Street.
Yeah, plus Carter said something about him being up on your phones.
Just as I feared.
Anything you can do to run interference for us at the bank, Detective, I would be most grateful.
I take it you know this gentleman?
Peter Yogorov, enforcer for the Russian mob.
Least he used to be until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov's at MCC, awaiting trial with his little brother Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all spartan on our emissaries,
Elias has made it clear...
that relationship is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians?
Open negotiations?
They have all the right pieces, but with us behind them, cash flow would no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
Looks like that pain-in-the-ass Donnelly finally caught up with the man in the suit.
Not even 7:00 AM, and already a perfect day.
The bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
I hate to say this, Finch, but we're in a bit of a pickle here.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're gonna dress up like bankers.
We're gonna climb up there and walk right out the front door.
Come on.
Base just picked up another burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
So, you can track him, but you can't hear what he's saying?
Do you know who he's talking to?
Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
Now, when you get up to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
Looks like nothing's going on inside.
No, the signal's still active, and the 911 call said the explosion was underground, remember?
He's in there.
All right, one team in front with me, second team, around the back.
We move in 30.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Hello.
Here.
Take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Everybody back against the wall!
- Stay where you are!
- Don't move!
- Hands up!
- See your hands!
Foyer's secure.
Check every ID.
No one leaves.
Half your men here, half with me.
Yes, sir.
Let's go!
Hands where we can see them!
You!
Don't move!
- See your ID, please?
- John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.
We got company.
Lose the weapons and get the hell out.
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.
Blew out the damn floor.
Alpha, this is Delta.
Vault level is secure.
I'm not gonna make it, Harold.
Sorry I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So, thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
John?
ID?
Harold Wren, Universal Heritage Insurance.
My associates.
Why are you in the bank?
We have a meeting with the vice president of Corporate Strategy.
ID.
Did you get what you wanted?
All the money Chapple stole.
More than $30 million.
Can you do anything with the accounts?
Yes.
I'll empty them, deposit every last cent into the accounts of reputable military charities.
Would that do?
Then I have to get you out of here and out of this state.
As long as we're together.
Check the top level.
Check down back.
Don't worry.
I got you covered.
What about John?
We finally got you.
Sir, there's a problem.
Step back.
Well, do you recognize him?
no.
Cuff 'em all.
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
2x10 Shadow Box
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Just hold him still.
Bear, afliggen!
Sit.
Well, that was a big help.
So, you said we had another number?
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes, maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan 18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
Any threats?
Not that I can see, but some anomalies.
She dumped her phone five days ago and moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him.
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
You'll manage.
- Detective.
- Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry.
Got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
Did you know him?
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.
What's your interest?
I got a tip, anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Whoa.
Well, maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st was offing dealers and selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars or dead, but not all of them.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
I'll catch up with you later.
So, with HR degraded to the point of irrelevance, my team is shifting priorities back to the man in the suit.
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?
- Yes, of course.
- Good.
We have some new information, including who he's working for.
Now, the bureau has been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks, like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources, and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you, may also have been recruited, possibly by the man in the suit.
- Really?
Snow?
- Makes sense.
I mean, Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.
He catches him, and then the man in the suit flips him.
Gets snow to be his asset.
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified, so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.
And I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
So, please, think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Carter.
Hello, Detective.
I need to find our friend.
We have a big problem.
You'll find him at the department of city planning.
So he just downloaded the file and walked out?
Yeah.
Didn't anyone try to stop her?
Apparently nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
Uh, what do we got?
- You heard the 10-31 too, Detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
Uh, like we were telling Marshal Jennings here--
Marshal Jennings, huh?
The manager called it in 'cause one of his staff, a girl by the name of Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
And walked out with it two hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Well, does anyone know what's on the file?
Well, we keep plans here for some important buildings, but all she walked out with were some engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
So, does anyone know where this Abby Monroe lives?
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
The phone number is a pay phone.
Hey, solid background check there.
What can I say?
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she was a flake.
Kids.
You never know.
Right, Detective?
Right.
Anyway, good job, following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
Thank you, Marshal.
Uh, look, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
John.
John!
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star?
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great, Carter.
Just flash a badge, and people tell you everything.
You gotta stop, John.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the man in the suit.
He has a new theory.
Yeah, that I'm working for China or something.
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher would be good for you too.
Long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll be hearing from me.
Okay.
All right, look.
We're gonna have to set some boundaries here.
Well, sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
Um, what's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking to see she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Carter, can you get me footage from that camera from about two hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle, Detective?
No, because it was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.
I got the camera tapes out of the robbery squad.
I see the perp is a single male.
You looking at the footage now?
Yes.
Why?
No reason.
Blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms, 'cause he knew he'd be less than 30 seconds.
He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
Whoa.
That's impressive.
What is-- what-- what is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too.
What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic, use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess, ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
The question is, what are they doing?
I don't think you're gonna like the answer.
Comp stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
The same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.
What was stolen?
Explosives.
Semtex.
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.
Let's see, theft of explosives, theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.
This guy could be the next Timothy McVeigh, and your girl is working with him.
He may have manipulated her into getting involved.
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55.
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Oh, yeah, sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
Or maybe he was on the take.
Did you hear me say that?
Don't know.
What are you saying?
Look, he was undercover narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts, a lot of money hanging around.
Anyway, why you want to know?
Ah, I just been seeing him around.
Yeah.
He's been hanging around Detective Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
Yeah.
I'm just saying, but the way
Abby went off the grid, cut all ties, she's planning something, Finch.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Well, her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism, which would be a relevant crime, the machine would have given her number to-- to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine, but what leads do we have left, Finch?
We have two.
First, the pay phone number that she gave the temp agency.
It's a street corner in Queens.
The agency must have been able to contact her there at one point.
It might give you a clue as to where she's living.
Okay.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life for the last year--
The charity, Homes For Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check that one out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
You're in a good mood, Mr. Reese.
I am.
I woke up this morning and felt-- it took me a while to put my finger on it, but I felt happy.
Must be this job.
Well, I'm glad.
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
I think I've found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe, Abby's little brother.
I'm an old friend of Abby's family, and as I was visiting New York, they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left her job here.
She never told them?
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
- Fire her?
What on earth for?
- Stealing.
At first, it was just petty cash, and I let it go, thinking it was simple carelessness, but then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts, trying to move money around-- significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple, that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Well, unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal, and our donations would just dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was eight, that time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then, I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated and it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right, and I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him, and I know that he would be proud of me, just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you, and I hope you never have to see this.
Any idea why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
Uh, they'd talk when he came by the offices.
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby, 'cause, just about that time, she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry.
We have a strict confidentiality agreement with all of our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman, explosives ordinance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.
He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than two months.
Did they know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on, and his fiancee dumped him.
Must be why he went to Chapple-- to ask for another loan.
However it happened, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, Detective.
Finch, are you still there?
Yes.
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest-- low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped into my pocket as I was leaving.
And where is the transponder now?
It's on a laundry van with Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously, Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in, see what I can find.
When I said you need to get out more,
I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese, and Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
So, I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside, but the alarm has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
Ah!
What was that?
Finch, get out now.
Who the hell are you?
Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same thing as you, I expect, and since you woke the whole building, we better hurry.
I'm on my way to you.
Please, just walk away now, Finch.
Shh!
- Who are you?
- It's okay.
- Let go of me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
Finch, get out now.
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.
Just get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Please don't do that.
Then get off of me.
Let me go.
Please, no guns.
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.
There they go!
Stop right there!
Get on, or they'll kill you!
Get on!
Finch, are you okay?
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!
I'll be in touch!
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
Okay, you should leave now, because my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but yes, and he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him, but first things first.
What does that message to your mom and dad mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out, or I'm--
What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
No, but I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief, and I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that, even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother Josh.
But I was lucky.
I made it out.
- Mr, Reese?
- Yes, Finch.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No, especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
You know, Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
Whatever you're planning, I know why, Abby.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.
- By lending him money?
- Yes.
Chapple made him a loan.
The interest rates tripled in a year.
No one could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancee.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple, one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
Look, I went through Chapple's files.
I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds, hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors by way of a wireless link, so I cloned the link and reprogrammed it to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle, which was exhilarating, by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
Working late?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
It's always something, you know?
Yeah.
Is something wrong, Carter?
Donnelly made me an offer today.
What, I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He, um, invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond, but think of the prospects, Carter, and the money.
You should do it.
But what about my kid?
I mean, it-- it'll probably mean
I have to move out of New York.
You mean I'd never see you again?
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Uh, now what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
It's Cal.
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
No problem.
I'm hoping you can help me out, Cal.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The Mayor has seen this crime spike in Crown Heights-- drug busts, uh, burglaries, even homicides.
He wants me to find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
So, do you?
Crown Heights, yeah.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach till Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from the inside, working to take over the Heights.
Boo.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I'm keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
What are you doing?
None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
You're checking him out for Carter?
No, I've been wondering who else you've been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when you made that call to Carter, pointing her towards me in the Davidson murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
You know how many times I've heard that?
And here I am, beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I said, go home.
There's our cell phone trail.
It looks like Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business name on the block, cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank, Merton Watts.
Maybe he has an account there.
Not according to his computer records.
- Then a safe deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, Chapple's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
If he's getting kickbacks from the banks--
You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
That means they handle all foreclosure sales.
And split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
Yes.
And for her brother.
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
So, how are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point and blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
System's back up.
They get anything from the safe?
The box code and the keys.
But there's no way they can get into the vault at the bank, is there?
What do you think?
Police band says they stole explosives and engineering plans.
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
It's a big area to cover.
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on, Donnelly?
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for has some sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops?
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The man in the suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know if you'll accept the temporary assignment to the bureau.
Okay, yes.
Good.
You won't regret it.
So, we've been tracking this man for ten months.
Every time we get close, he slips right out from under us, as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead, and then I realized, the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I thought of that.
Cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs.
- Came up with nothing.
- Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from that night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found short bursts of a cloned IMEI with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.
24 hours ago, the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned imeis at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
Abby, this is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough, Abby.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
Now, the truth... or I take you to the cops myself.
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We want to give it back to the people he stole it from.
How?
We haven't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought very far at all.
Now, why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
Abby did.
She went to the DA, but Chapple got there first, spread his poison.
The DA even threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he would come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there?
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.
John, this has gone far enough.
Has it, Finch?
Yes.
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them, Finch.
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
Besides, I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
John, it's far too risky.
What did you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
Now.
This is where the safe deposit boxes are.
We realized we couldn't get to them from inside the bank, so we decided to bring them to us.
You're gonna blow the roof.
We got something here.
John, what's your situation?
Ten more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
No, it's a broad spectrum sweep, heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line and please get out now.
If Shayn and Abby won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people, and they're bringing down a very bad man.
Now, isn't that what your experiment's all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
Five minutes and we're out.
In three, two, one.
Let's go.
There, 158.
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
- Is this what you need?
- Is it ever.
There's more than $30 million here.
His charity stole $30 million.
Then let's go, back the way we came.
Get down!
- You okay?
- Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We've got to get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
We're tracking IMEI bursts in the same area.
It's him.
Now, we hook up a SWAT en route.
- Are you with us?
- Uh, yeah, of course.
I just need to make a phone call.
All right, make it quick.
Hi, mom, can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
Mom?
You been drinking, Carter?
Tell Harold, Donnelly is headed to Wall Street.
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phones.
Okay, mom.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
Hey, it's Fusco.
Wherever wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street, because that's where Donnelly's heading.
That's exactly where John is.
Merton Watts Investment Bank, Hanover Street.
Yeah, plus Carter said something about him being up on your phones.
Just as I feared.
Anything you can do to run interference for us at the bank, Detective, I would be most grateful.
I take it you know this gentleman?
Peter Yogorov, enforcer for the Russian mob.
Least he used to be until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov's at MCC, awaiting trial with his little brother Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all spartan on our emissaries,
Elias has made it clear-- that relationship is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians?
Open negotiations?
They have all the right pieces, but with us behind them, cash flow would no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
Looks like that pain-in-the-ass Donnelly finally caught up with the man in the suit.
Not even 7:00 AM, and already a perfect day.
The bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
I hate to say this, Finch, but we're in a bit of a pickle here.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're gonna dress up like bankers.
We're gonna climb up there and walk right out the front door.
Come on.
Base just picked up another burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
So, you can track him, but you can't hear what he's saying?
Do you know who he's talking to?
Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
Now, when you get up to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
Looks like nothing's going on inside.
No, the signal's still active, and the 911 call said the explosion was underground, remember?
He's in there.
All right, one team in front with me, second team, around the back.
We move in 30.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Hello.
Here.
Take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Everybody back against the wall!
- Stay where you are!
- Don't move!
- Hands up!
- See your hands!
Foyer's secure.
Check every ID.
No one leaves.
Half your men here, half with me.
Yes, sir.
Let's go!
Hands where we can see them!
You!
Don't move!
- See your ID, please?
- John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.
We got company.
Lose the weapons and get the hell out.
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.
Blew out the damn floor.
Alpha, this is Delta.
Vault level is secure.
I'm not gonna make it, Harold.
Sorry I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So, thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
John?
[ ♪ Gimme Shelter ♪ by The Rolling Stones ]
ID?
Harold Wren, Universal Heritage Insurance.
My associates.
Why are you in the bank?
We have a meeting with the vice president of Corporate Strategy.
ID.
Did you get what you wanted?
All the money Chapple stole.
More than $30 million.
Can you do anything with the accounts?
Yes.
I'll empty them, deposit every last cent into the accounts of reputable military charities.
Would that do?
Then I have to get you out of here and out of this state.
As long as we're together.
Check the top level.
Check down back.
Don't worry.
I got you covered.

Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good... keep the rules.
But now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Just hold him still.
Bear, afliggen!
Sit.
Well, that was a big help.
So, you said we had another number?
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity, Homes For Our Returning Heroes... maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan 18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
Any threats?
Not that I can see... but some anomalies.
She dumped her phone 5 days ago and moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her... was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him!
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
You'll manage.
Detective.
Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry.
I got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
Did you know him?
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.
What's your interest?
I got a tip... anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Whoa.
Well, maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st was, uh, offing dealers and selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars or dead, but not all of them.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
I'll catch up with you later.
So, with HR degraded to the point of irrelevance, my team is shifting priorities back to the man in the suit.
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?
Yes, of course.
Good.
We have some new information... including who he's working for.
Now, the bureau has been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks... like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources, and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you, may also have been recruited... possibly by the man in the suit.
Really?
- Snow?
- Makes sense.
I mean, Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.
He catches him... and then the man in the suit flips him.
Gets Snow to be his asset.
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified... so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.
And I know, with your skills... it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
So, please, think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
Thanks.
- Carter.
- Hello, Detective.
I need to find our friend.
We have a big problem.
You'll find him at the department of city planning.
So she just downloaded the file and walked out?
Yeah.
Didn't anyone try to stop her?
Apparently nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
Uh... what do we got?
You heard the 10-31 too, Detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
- Uh, like we were telling...
Marshal Jennings here--
- Marshal Jennings, huh?
The manager called it in 'cause one of his staff, a girl by the name of Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
And walked out with it 2 hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Well, does anyone know what's on the file?
Well, we keep plans here for some important buildings, but... all she walked out with were some engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
So, does anyone know where this Abby Monroe lives?
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
The phone number is a pay phone.
Hey.
Solid background check there.
What can I say?
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she was a flake.
Kids.
You never know.
Right, Detective?
Right.
Anyway, good job, following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
Thank you, Marshal.
Uh, look, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
John.
John!
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings.
You took his star.
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great, Carter.
Just... flash a badge, and people tell you everything.
You gotta stop, John.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the man in the suit.
He has a new theory.
Yeah, that I'm working for China or something?
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher would be good for you too.
As long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll be hearing from me.
Okay.
All right, look.
We're gonna have to set some boundaries here.
Well, sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
Um... what's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking to see she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Carter, can you get me footage from that camera from about 2 hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle, Detective?
No.
Because it was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens 4 days ago.
I got the camera tapes out of the robbery squad.
I see the perp is a single male.
- You looking at the footage now?
- Yes.
Why?
No reason.
Blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms, 'cause he knew he'd be less than 30 seconds.
He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
Whoa.
That's impressive.
What is... wha-what is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too.
What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic... use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess... ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
The question is, what are they doing?
I don't think you're gonna like the answer.
Comp stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
The same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey 3 nights ago.
What was stolen?
Explosives.
Semtex.
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.
Let's see, theft of explosives, theft of engineering plans... for a block on Wall Street.
This guy could be the next Timothy McVeigh, and your girl is working with him.
He may have manipulated her into getting involved.
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55?
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Oh, yeah, sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
- Or maybe he was on the take.
- Did you hear me say that?
Don't know.
What are you saying?
Look.
He was undercover narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts, a lot of money hanging around.
Anyway, why you want to know?
Ah, I just been seeing him around.
Yeah.
He's been hanging around Detective Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
Yeah.
I'm just saying... but the way Abby went off the grid, cut all ties... she's planning something, Finch.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Well, her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism... which would be a relevant crime, the machine would've given her number to... to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine, but what leads do we have left, Finch?
We have 2.
First, the pay phone number that she gave the temp agency.
It's a street corner in Queens.
The agency must've been able to contact her there at one point.
It might give you a clue as to where she's living.
Okay.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life for the last year, the charity, Homes For Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check that one out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
- You're in a good mood, Mr. Reese.
- I am.
I woke up this morning and felt-
- It took me a while to put my finger on it, but I felt happy.
Must be this job.
Well, I'm glad.
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
I think I've found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe...
Abby's little brother.
I'm an old friend of Abby's family, and as I was visiting New York... they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left her job here.
Oh, she never told them?
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
Fire her?
- What on earth for?
- Stealing.
At first, it was just petty cash, and I let it go... thinking it was simple carelessness.
But then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts... trying to move money around... significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple.
That really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Well, unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal, and our donations would just dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't... think you've really been mad at me since I was 8... that time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then, I've always tried to be good... keep the rules.
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated and... it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right.
And...
I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him.
And I know... that he would be proud of me.
Just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you.
And I hope you never have to see this.
Any idea... why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
Uh, they'd talk... when he came by the offices.
Somehow... he must've made an impression on Abby, 'cause, just about that time... she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry.
We have a strict confidentiality agreement with all of our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not... a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman.
Explosives ordinance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan 3 years ago.
He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than 2 months.
Did they know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his... home foreclosed on, and his fiancee dumped him.
Must be why he went to Chapple... to ask for another loan.
However it happened...
I mean, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, Detective.
Finch?
Are you still there?
Yes.
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with 2 armed men.
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest...
low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped into my pocket as I was leaving.
And where is the transponder now?
It's on a laundry van with Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously, Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in, see what I can find.
When I said you need to get out more, I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese.
And Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
So, I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside.
But the alarm... has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
Ah!
What was that?
Finch, get out now.
Who the hell are you?
Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same thing as you, I expect, and since you woke the whole building, we better hurry.
I'm on my way to you.
Please, just walk away now, Finch.
Shh!
Who are you?
!
- Let go of me!
- It's Okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Finch, get out now.
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.
Just get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Mmn!
Please don't do that.
Then get off of me.
Let me go.
Please, no guns.
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.
There they go!
Stop right there!
Get on, or they'll kill you!
Get on!
Finch, are you Okay?
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!
I'll be in touch!
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
Okay.
You should leave now, because my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but yes.
And he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him.
But first things first.
What does that message to your mom and dad mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out!
- Or I'm--
- What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
No.
But I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief.
And I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that.
Even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother Josh.
But I was lucky.
I made it out.
- Mr, Reese?
- Yes, Finch.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No, and especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
You know, Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
Once you leave with Shayn...
I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
Whatever you're planning, I know why, Abby.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me.
What did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle.
- But he nearly destroyed Shayn.
- By lending him money.
Yes.
Chapple made him a loan.
The interest rates tripled in a year.
No one... could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancee.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple... one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
Look, I went through Chapple's files.
I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds... hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors by way of a wireless link... so I cloned the link... and reprogrammed it... to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle... which was exhilarating... by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
You working late?
Uh... yeah.
Um--
It's always something, you know?
Yeah.
Something wrong, Carter?
Donnelly made me an offer today.
What, I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He, um... invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond, but think of the prospects, Carter.
And the money.
You should do it.
But what about my kid?
I mean, it--
It'll probably mean I...
I have to move out of New York.
You mean I'd never see you again?
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Uh, now what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
It's Cal.
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
No problem.
I'm hoping you can help me out, Cal.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The Mayor has seen this crime spike in Crown Heights... drug busts, uh, burglaries, even homicides.
He wants me to find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
So, do you?
Crown Heights, yeah.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach till Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from the inside, working to take over the Heights.
Boo!
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I'm keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
- What are you doing?
- None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
You're checking him out for Carter.
No.
I've been wondering who else you've been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when you made that call to Carter... pointing her towards me in the Davidson murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
Huh.
You know how many times I've heard that?
And here I am... beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I said, go home.
There's our cell phone trail.
Looks like Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business name on the block... cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank...
Merton Watts.
Maybe he has an account there.
Not according to his computer records.
- Then a safe deposit box.
- What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, Chapple's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
If he's getting kickbacks from the banks--
You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
That means they handle all foreclosure sales.
And split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
Yes.
And for her brother?
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
So, how are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point... and blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
System's back up.
They get anything from the safe?
The box code and the keys.
But there's no way they can get into the vault at the bank, is there?
What do you think?
Police band says they stole explosives and engineering plans.
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
It's a big area to cover.
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on, Donnelly?
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for has some... sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops?
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The man in the suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know... if you'll accept the temporary assignment to the bureau.
Okay, yes.
Good.
You won't regret it.
So... we've been tracking this man for 10 months.
Every time we get close, he slips right out from under us, as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead... any lead... and then I realized... the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I thought of that.
Cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs, came up with nothing.
Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from that night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found short bursts of a cloned IMEI with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature. 24 hours ago, the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned IMEIs at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
Abby.
This is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough, Abby.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
Now, the truth... or I take you to the cops myself.
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We want to give it back to the people he stole it from.
How?
We haven't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought very far at all.
Now, why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
Abby did.
She went to the DA.
But Chapple got there first, spread his poison.
The DA even threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he would come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there?
When we blow that wall, we're underneath it.
John, this has gone far enough.
Has it, Finch?
Yes.
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them, Finch.
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
Besides...
I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
John, it's far too risky.
What did you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
Now.
This is where the safe deposit boxes are.
We realized we couldn't get to them from inside the bank, so... we decided to bring them to us.
You're gonna blow the roof.
We got something here.
John, what's your situation?
10 more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
No, it's a... broad spectrum sweep, heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line and please get out now.
If Shayn and Abby won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people.
And they're bringing down a very bad man.
Now, isn't that what your experiment's all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
5 minutes and we're out.
In 3, 2, 1.
Let's go.
There, 158.
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
Is this what you need?
Is it ever.
There's more than 30 million here.
His charity stole 30 million.
Then let's go, back the way we came.
Get down!
- You Okay?
- Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We've got to get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
We're tracking IMEI bursts in the same area.
It's him.
Now, we hook up a SWAT en route.
Are you with us?
Uh, yeah, of course.
I just need to make a phone call.
All right, make it quick.
Hi, mom?
Can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
Mom?
You been drinking, Carter?
Tell Harold, Donnelly is headed to Wall Street.
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phones.
Okay, mom.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
Hey, it's Fusco.
Wherever wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street, because that's where Donnelly's heading.
That's exactly where John is.
Merton Watts Investment Bank, Hanover Street.
Yeah, plus Carter said something about him being up on your phones.
Just as I feared.
Anything you can do to run interference for us at the bank, Detective, I would be most grateful.
I take it you know this gentleman.
Peter Yogorov... enforcer for the Russian mob.
Least he used to be until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov's at MCC, awaiting trial with his little brother Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all spartan on our emissaries, Elias has made it clear.
That relationship... is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians?
Open negotiations?
They have all the right pieces... but with us behind them, cash flow would no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
Looks like that pain-in-the-ass Donnelly... finally caught up with the man in the suit.
Not even 7 am... and already a perfect day.
The bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
I hate to say this, Finch, but we're in a bit of a pickle here.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're gonna dress up like bankers.
We're gonna climb up there... and walk right out the front door.
Come on.
Base just picked up another burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
So, you can track him, but you can't hear what he's saying?
Do you know who he's talking to?
Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
Now, when you get up to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
Looks like nothing's going on inside.
No, the signal's still active, and the 911 call said the explosion was underground, remember?
He's in there.
All right, one team in front with me, second team, around the back.
We move in 30.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Hello.
Here.
Take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Everybody back against the wall!
- Stay where you are!
- Don't move!
- Hands up!
- See your hands!
Foyer's secure.
Check every ID.
No one leaves.
Half your men here, half with me.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go!
- Hands where we can see them!
You!
Don't move!
- See your ID, please?
- John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.
We got company.
Lose the weapons and get the hell out.
John, can you hear me?
- You must get out now.
- Blew out the damn floor.
Alpha, this is Delta.
Vault level--
I'm not gonna make it, Harold.
Sorry I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So, thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
John?
ID?
Harold Wren, Universal Heritage Insurance.
My associates.
Why are you in the bank?
We have a meeting with the vice president of Corporate Strategy.
ID.
Did you get what you wanted?
All the money Chapple stole.
More than 30 million.
Can you do anything with the accounts?
Yes.
I'll empty them, deposit every last cent into the accounts of reputable military charities.
Would that do?
Then I have to get you out of here and out of this state.
As long as we're together.
Check the top level.
Check down back.
Don't worry.
I got you covered.
What about John?
We finally got you.
Sir, there's a problem.
Step back.
Well, do you recognize him?
Uh... no.
Cuff 'em all!
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system.
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
911, what is your emergency?
This is subway train operator 4827.
There's been an accident.
I couldn't stop the train in time and I hit a kid.
I think he might have been pushed.
Open.
I want them held in isolation.
No contact.
Not with their lawyers, not with each other, not with anybody.
This is a matter of national security.
They're terrorists?
Look more like investment bankers to me.
Well, warden, three of them may be.
But one of them is the most dangerous criminal I've ever pursued.
I can hold them for 72 hours without charging them and I fully intend to.
Then you have 72 hours.
This is Rikers, not Guantanamo.
You don't plan on asking them any questions?
Don't worry, Carter.
We got DNA evidence from New Rochelle we got the blood from the burned car, and, thanks to you, fingerprints.
He's ours.
How did I know the government would be no match for you?
It might be compromising to be found with a phone.
I'll be brief.
The matter is in hand.
We'll get you out of there.
I took too many risks.
It's my fault.
I'll handle it.
I've made preparations for a scenario like this.
In 72 hours, you will walk free.
What if another number comes up?
Unfortunately, as I told you, they never stop coming.
I'll have to manage as best I can.
I sincerely hope our next conversation is under better circumstances.
I'll be in touch.
My name is Mr. Swift.
I'm your substitute teacher.
Ms. Benthem received a last-minute opportunity to attend an all-expenses-paid teaching seminar in Maui.
I see in Ms. Benthem's lesson plan that today we're doing...
Addition?
That can't be right.
It's busywork.
Punishment.
We're supposed to add all the numbers from one to 100.
Math is not punishment.
You know, in the late 18th century there was a math prodigy named Carl Friedrich Gauss who was faced with the same tedious problem that you are.
He figured a way around it.
One to a hundred.
Who'd like to take a crack at working out Gauss' equation?
Anybody?
Mr. Phipps?
Uh...
I gotta be honest, Mr. Swifty, you lost me at "Friedrich," so...
I'll give you a hint.
Fusco.
Good morning, detective.
I trust that you received my email.
And the roll call for Brooklyn Science.
I need you to tell me everything you can about Caleb Phipps.
Couple run-ins with the N.Y.P.D., typical kid stuff.
- Nothing exceptional.
I'll say.
2.6 GPA and test scores that sit squarely in the midrange.
He spent my whole class doodling in his notebook.
Hey, you still there?
Please continue.
One thing did come up.
Caleb had an older brother Ryan.
Killed two years ago in a subway accident.
Kid was drunk, slipped on the tracks and got clipped.
Sounds awful.
Any further details?
I'll pull the incident report.
Now Caleb lives alone with his mom.
She's an administrative assistant in Kensington.
Hey, Caleb.
You going to that party Saturday?
- Uh, no, that's not my kind of thing.
Oh.
Besides, I'm heading out of town.
- Taking a trip.
- Hi.
Yo, what's up?
- What's up?
Never seem to stop texting.
- Feel like I'm on another planet.
- Their planet's gonna be running ours.
High schools are different now.
Gang fights, drug searches, pregnancies.
This kid could be into anything.
You weren't exaggerating about the drug problem.
Kids ain't what they used to be.
Be careful in there, pal.
I won't even ask.
Probably best.
Besides, we have more urgent matters to discuss.
Our friend in Rikers.
I have the situation in hand.
I don't want you crossing some kind of line to do...
This?
Already deleted them from the network too.
That line you're talking about?
I crossed it a long time ago.
We have to deal with the DNA sample.
FBI keeps it in a secure lab here in New York.
I know what to do.
But I'm gonna need a couple things from you.
This is Principal Lawton reminding you that Brooklyn School of Science and Humanities closes at 5 p.m.
Thank you.
Mr. Swift.
A word, please.
It has come to my attention you tried to show Ms. Benthem's students how to get around one of her assignments?
Well, the assignment seemed a bit remedial.
- I was hoping to teach...
- Teaching is Ms. Benthem's job.
Yourjob is to ensure that her students do the work that she prepared.
Don't sweat Lawton.
She thinks schools would run better if they just got rid of the students and teachers.
Chris Beckner, Computer Science.
Harold Swift.
- Nice to meet an idealist.
- Oh, no, not me.
Throw all this stuff online, I say.
Let me teach in my boxers.
Run wild, man.
I believe I will.
Yes, Detective Fusco.
You have some new information for me?
Yeah, as a matter of fact I do.
I took a look at the report on his brother's death.
- Caleb was the only witness.
He was there?
His brother died right in front of him?
Something's not right.
I looked at every incident report that night.
The transit cop called for a backup to dispatch and then canceled the request.
Why would a policeman rescind a request?
That's what I'm trying to figure.
I'm waiting on the transcripts to find out.
Maybe it's time I go meet Caleb's mom and find out what his home life is like.
Interesting.
Caleb's latest national aptitude test score is exactly 50 percent.
A statistically improbable score.
Unless you try to get it.
Caleb knew the answer to every question but he chose to fill in every other one.
- I don't get it.
He tanked on purpose?
Why would you hide the fact you're a genius?
Why indeed.
Caleb, a word?
I couldn't help but notice this.
No offense, Mr. Swift, but now you're going through the garbage?
Pi.
Can any of you tell me what it means?
I'll settle for an intelligent question here.
- Yes?
My friend has a question, Mr. Swift.
"What is any of this good for?
And when would we ever use it?"
Let me show you.
Pi.
The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
And this is just the beginning.
It keeps on going.
Forever.
Without ever repeating.
Which means that contained within this string of decimals is every single other number.
Your birthdate, combination to your locker, your Social Security number.
It's all in there somewhere.
And if you convert these decimals into letters you would have every word that ever existed in every possible combination.
The first syllable you spoke as a baby.
The name of your latest crush.
Your entire life story from beginning to end.
Everything we ever say or do.
All of the world's infinite possibilities rest within this one simple circle.
Now, what you do with that information what it's good for that would be up to you.
N.Y.P.D., ma'am.
We're investigating a string of burglaries in the area.
Talking to residents about things they might have seen.
Mind if I come in and ask you a few questions?
LORl:
I'm running a little late.
So you, uh...?
You live alone?
With my son, Caleb.
We don't have a lot of room, so Caleb takes the couch.
Uh, that's work.
Just give me a sec.
So you and your son see anything suspicious?
Any strange comings and goings, anyone who stands out?
LORl:
Nothing I can think of.
Cops come a few times a year.
It's domestic stuff mostly.
Some families have it rough, you know?
Yeah.
I know exactly what you mean.
Thanks for your time.
Yes, detective?
I planted that webcam for you.
Met Caleb's mom.
Late for work, out the door with the shakes.
Guess she's hitting the bottle.
No wonder Caleb doesn't care about his grades.
Anything new on our two dealers?
Diego Velasquez and Ronnie Samms.
Used to deal for a guy by the name of Lorenzo.
Type of guy you don't wanna cross.
They're working for some up-and-comer Narcotics hasn't been able to identify.
- I'll tell you, that school's a real minefield.
- Okay.
Gonna keep your mouth shut, right, chief?
Yeah.
Sure.
Except to say this.
Next time you decide you wanna deal E to a kid who's clearly never bought in his life do it in the locker room.
Because this jumpy fool is a neon sign shouting, "Drugs ahoy," chief.
Aah.
That's enough.
Unless you wanna settle this in the principal's office.
- Are you okay?
- I don't need your help.
Okay?
"Hacker" used to refer to industrious coders who pushed the boundaries of modern computing.
Then that word became misappropriated by those who pushed the boundaries so far that they ended up with jail time.
Like Kevin Mitnick back in the 1980s.
He was trying to see how stuff worked.
He was looking for flaws in the system.
And he did so by breaking the law.
He proved people were the flaw.
They're paying him millions for the same thing that got him locked up in the first place.
Perhaps the most notorious hacker of them all was the one that got away.
Back when Uncle Sam was trying to maintain its iron grip on the budding Internet, or ARPANET as it was known then this hacker, this coder, hacked into the system and laid its secrets bare.
Ensuring that the Internet would become an open forum.
Plus, that hacker made his mark without ever getting busted.
True.
Whoever it was, that person's still out there.
Yeah, I'm checking on the boy genius.
Not you, the other one.
Turns out he's quite the little coder.
He's been coding a massive program.
In longhand, as he doesn't have a computer at home.
Then he writes it into a computer in the lab.
If the partial code I discovered is a snapshot of his work what he's creating could be groundbreaking.
Detective Fusco, can you do something for me?
I need you to follow Diego and Ronnie.
Caleb had a run-in with them.
Might lead to trouble.
- Is there a history there?
- Hard to tell.
But Caleb seemed to take an outsized interest in their drug dealing.
If someone's pulling their strings, I'd like to know who.
Whoever this drug dealer is, he's careful.
Detective.
How goes phase one of your plan?
I got the package you sent over but if I'm gonna wade into this pool, I need the right specs.
Yeah.
Sending them to you now.
Our friend in Rikers is counting on you.
- Okay.
Knock them dead, detective.
They won't know what hit them.
Heh.
Rolling in my Lacky in a twisted cap
Wow.
Tanqueray on ice in the back seat, P
- Hi.
I'd like to have...
- The first one on me.
How you doing?
Thanks, but, um, I'm looking for something a little more specific.
Detective Fusco, our young man is on the move.
Give you a ride home?
- My car's right down there.
I'd like that.
I have to admit, you kind of threw me at first.
Asking all those questions about my background, my health.
I couldn't tell whether we were flirting or filling out my medical history.
I'm a practical girl.
I like to know what I'm getting into.
So are we getting into anything tonight?
I am.
Whoa.
I don't know what happened.
I didn't even have that much to drink.
Yeah.
Open wide, big fellow.
I've been following this drug money all night.
Diego and Ronnie handed a bag full of it to a homeless guy.
He dumped it off at a money transfer place.
The worker there wired it to another money hub across town where I hoofed over in time to see some other guy pick up the cash and drop it at a P.O. Box in Crown Heights.
Our mysterious drug lord is laundering his money.
Making it untraceable.
Yeah, well not untraceable enough.
Whoever comes in for this cash is our guy.
Where are you anyway?
Looking at you.
Thought you were following the kid.
I am.
Here you go, sir.
- Thanks.
Well, I'll be damned.
Our mystery drug lord is Caleb.
I've graded your quizzes.
Some of you have been paying attention.
Caleb, I expected better.
- What'd the kid do now?
- Caleb got a message.
He's supposed to meet his supplier at 2.
We have to follow him.
Tricky bastard, keeping his identity a secret.
He's better than dealers twice his age.
I'll be sure and tell him how impressed you are with his criminal aptitude.
Becknerjust broke into Caleb's account, detective.
He's copying a file named 17-6-21 onto a thumb drive.
Whatever Caleb's making, his teacher's interest in it is far from academic.
Oh, Mr. Phipps.
I'm kind of on my way somewhere.
I just wanted to return something of yours.
You dropped this yesterday.
You gotta stop going through the trash, Mr. Swift.
You know, I used to do a little coding myself.
That's an elegant string, but it occurs to me if you want to implement multi-threading you'd do better to use atomic variables.
Just a thought.
Wait, that works.
Yes, that's why I suggested it.
Uh, thanks.
I hope you have your service weapon with you, detective.
Yeah, I got you a machine gun too.
Very funny, detective.
Let's try not to lose him.
Yo, Roman.
You here?
Oh, jeez.
Whoa.
That's what you came for, right?
So tell me, why would a kid like you do something so stupid like dealing at a school in my neighborhood?
That's Lorenzo, all right.
Diego and Ronnie's old boss.
What's the plan?
Crap.
You know, before he had his little accident here Roman was telling me how you're just trying to score some bank, take a big trip.
- That true?
- Yeah.
You pay back every dime you made selling to my customers I'll let you leave town intact.
Be back here tomorrow night, 8 p.m., or I'll come find you.
How do you expect me to score that kind of cash in a day?
Relax.
All right, I'll rob a bank or something.
I like you.
You got brass.
But you don't show tomorrow night, I'll break a lot more than your legs.
Kid's got it tough.
But picking a fight with a drug dealer?
Heh.
It's a dumb move for a genius.
Why would a young man with such potential risk it all just to get some easy drug money?
I don't think it's about the money.
I think it's about the brother.
Dispatch transcripts from the night Ryan Phipps died.
Now, the transit cop who filed the report called for backup because Caleb initially reported that two youths got into a shoving match with Ryan pushed him onto the tracks.
But the officer canceled the backup call and filed an accident report instead.
Why would Caleb change his story?
Maybe he knew the killers.
Maybe he was thinking about taking care of them himself.
Diego and Ronnie?
He's manipulating those morons.
Got them running drugs for him and they don't even know it.
What's Beckner so absorbed in?
That's Caleb's work.
Howard, it's Chris.
Can you still meet up tonight?
I think you'll be impressed with what you see.
Great, I'll see you there.
Change of plans, detective.
Let me guess.
You need me to keep an eye on Little Einstein myself tonight.
Keep me posted.
So, Mr. Venture Capital Firm Partner...
Junior partner.
Long way from the corner office.
Still have to watch my step.
- Pick my projects carefully.
- I get it.
But when you see this...
Well, then let's just see it, Chris, so I can get back to my wife and kids.
What the hell was that?
The Library of Congress.
What?
Two-hundred and thirty-five terabytes on one thumb drive?
The Internet's choking on streaming video.
They're gonna need a new compression algorithm to continue growing and I've got it.
All I need is an investment from a firm like yours to help get it off the ground.
So here's the thing, Chris.
I remember your code from back in college.
You were a medium talent at best.
There is no way that that Chris Beckner designed something this extraordinary.
Unlike our old friends, I didn't peak in college.
So no one else knows about this project?
Programmers, developers, no other entanglements?
I can guarantee it.
Well, let's hope so.
Because I would hate for anyone to come between you and what I believe is going to be a very large check.
Finally tracked down that transit cop.
The one who was first on the scene when Caleb's brother died.
Left a message for him to come to the 8th after his shift.
- Speaking of which, where's the kid?
- Moving money.
Large amounts.
- Getting the cash to pay off Lorenzo?
- No, he's set up a trust.
He's pouring all his money into it.
Maybe he's thinking about taking that trip he's always talking about.
Becknerjust texted Caleb.
He wants to meet at 8 tonight.
The same time he's supposed to meet Lorenzo.
He can't be in two places at once.
Unless I'm right and this kid's got a plan time's running out on two fronts.
Maybe skipping town's the best thing for him.
We can focus on getting your pal out of lockup.
Mr. Reese can take care of himself.
And right now, he's in very capable hands.
Detective Carter?
Time is ticking away fast for our friend in Rikers.
Don't worry.
I know what to do.
Here you go.
Mm, I'm sorry, honey.
I'll be better tomorrow.
I promise.
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be better tomorrow, Ma.
Detective Fusco.
I just wanna remind you that I need your help tonight.
Caleb has two appointments, and we have no idea which one he intends to keep.
I'll be there.
You wanted to speak with me?
Yeah.
Have a seat, Officer Murphy.
Like I said, I'm, uh, working a cold case.
Commuter got pushed.
Looking for related cases and this popped up.
Ryan Phipps.
- Says here you were first on the scene?
- Yeah, that's right.
Kid was six months shy of his 18th birthday.
Coming home with his little brother, Caleb.
Ryan was horsing around, drinking a little bit.
- Slipped on the tracks and got clipped.
- Yeah, I remember.
It was a rough one.
Because it was a kid?
Or because you didn't report the whole story?
I know about the kids who pushed Ryan on the tracks.
I'm no detective, detective.
I'm just a lowly transit cop.
I've seen a lot of things in my time and I made a lot of decisions I regret.
- This is not one of those times.
- You may regret it when Caleb becomes a killer.
What are you talking about?
You think revenge is gonna make Caleb feel better about seeing his brother die?
- You're a long ways off, detective.
- Then give me some directions.
You know, I did to the kid what you're doing to me right now.
When I asked him for descriptions of the other kids he kept changing it up.
There were no other kids.
No.
Just two brothers drinking, bored waiting for a train to go home.
So they dare each other to, uh, cross the tracks.
You know, how many times you can cross back and forth before a train comes.
Well, Ryan doesn't wanna lose to his little brother.
One kid makes it, the other kid doesn't.
I don't know who got the better deal.
So I told him I'd leave all that out of the report.
Write it up as an accident and for him to keep it to himself.
Doesn't matter what he had to tell his mom or the cops or God himself.
Nothing was gonna bring his brother back.
What can I tell you?
Some things you can't fix.
Hey, I just talked to Murphy.
Brother's death was an accident, but it sounds like Caleb blames himself.
Well, that's a problem because I lost Caleb.
He got on a bus and it left before I could catch up.
You kidding me?
Of the many things I am equipped to do, pursuit would not be chief among them.
Our only option is to wait for Caleb at the two places he's likeliest to turn up.
I'll stake out Beckner at the school.
You keep an eye out for our aggrieved drug dealer.
Get everyone and hunt that kid down.
Our boy's a no-show, and Lorenzo wants his head.
You worry about the kid, I'll take care of Lorenzo.
He's not here either, detective.
I may be too late.
- Swift, what are you doing here?
- I was gonna ask you the same.
I left some papers...
Stop.
I saw you break into Caleb's account and copy his files.
Is that what you're willing to stoop to?
Stealing work and passing it off as your own?
I am not gonna be accused of plagiarism by some substitute teacher.
Besides, why would I copy work off of a C student?
Because Caleb is anything but average.
And you know it.
That's why you took his work to your friend.
Caleb approached me a few months ago about this project he was working on.
I was skeptical, but when I saw his code, I couldn't believe my eyes.
- So I decided to help him.
- By cutting him out.
No.
All he wanted was some money up front for this trip.
- He said he didn't even want credit.
- Why would you agree to that?
I didn't.
Read it for yourself.
Caleb gets all the credit.
It was just easier for me to pitch the idea to them myself, get some capital and then reveal the true brain behind it.
He offered me half if I put the other half in a trust that he set up for his mom.
But I'm giving him the whole thing.
All the money from 17-6-21.
17-6-21?
It's the name he gave the program.
Said it was some kind of dedication.
Look, I am telling you, six months from now Caleb is going to be the richest 18-year-old in the country.
No.
No, he won't.
Dispatch, Officer Murphy, regarding the subway fatality.
10-80 on the backup request.
10-5, officer.
Cancel backup request?
Affirmative.
This seat taken?
What are you doing here?
You're so smart, Caleb, ask me something you don't know.
The thing about being reckless taking chances is that you make a lot of mistakes, cause a lot of grief.
You're gonna start lecturing me on mistakes?
How I need to live and learn, move on?
That's really inspiring, Mr. Swift.
I'd stand up on my desk and clap for you, but...
No.
Your mistakes, like mine, are part of who you are now.
You can't move on from that.
Believe me, I've made a sizable number.
But sometimes your mistakes can surprise you.
My biggest mistake, for instance brought me here at exactly this moment when you might need some help.
Seventeen years, 6 months, and 21 days into your life.
The age at which your brother died.
The age you've chosen to end your life too.
17-6-21.
So you see, maybe you and I are connected.
Two reckless people.
Yeah, then what's the use?
We're just gonna keep breaking things over and over.
Why not save everyone the grief?
The thing about the world is that it doesn't have any extra pieces.
It's like pi.
It contains everything.
You remove a single piece, no circle.
Your recklessness, your mistakes are the reason why when they say you can't change the world you won't listen.
The world is better off with both of us in it, Caleb.
Rather than the alternative.
You sure about that?
Yes.
And your mom is better off with you in it.
If you think money can replace you you haven't seen the whole equation.
Take it from someone who thought that leaving would make it easier on everyone and then learned otherwise.
Say it to me again.
Slowly.
According to the lab results, none of the DNA from these four men matches any of the DNA in our database.
They're clean, sir.
All four of them.
I want those samples sent to Quantico, reviewed through CODIS and inspected for tampering.
They got to it.
I don't know how, but those bastards got to it.
Go.
One more thing.
Get me Carter.
You really ought to be more careful with your code.
Thanks.
I grew up during the Cold War.
When computer networks were just a gleam in the eye of the Department of Defense.
Things seemed more black and white then.
ARPANET was the new frontier.
Till a kid with a homemade computer turned the whole thing inside out.
All I'm saying is it's a new era now and things are about to get really weird.
So you should keep your code close to your vest.
And pick your friends wisely.
Pi?
The first 3000 digits.
My number's in there somewhere.
You're smart, you'll figure it out.
Wait.
Uh, the hacker the one who got away.
How'd you know he did that with a homemade computer?
I've read all that research.
No one's ever mentioned that.
I must have heard it somewhere.
Detective Carter, has our friend in Rikers been released?
Almost.
I'm gonna meet him now.
Your DNA wasn't a match for whoever they're looking for.
I'm gonna be processing you out momentarily.
Let's go, line them up.
Stop right there.
These men have all been classified as unlawful combatants by the AUMF.
Until we can establish they're not a threat to national security, they're not going anywhere.
Put them back.
Just the person I wanted to see.
What is going on?
I thought the evidence cleared these guys.
The DNA, the fingerprints, it's all too neat.
I've been burned trying to bring this man to justice.
There's only person that I know I can trust anymore, you.
You've been chasing him from the beginning.
We've got one shot left at him, detective.
If he walks out, we're never gonna see him.
I know you were a senior interrogator in Iraq.
Time to put those military skills to use.
I want you to interrogate these men.
Find out who they are, what they know.
Start with him.
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system.
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.
I've always tried to be good.
Keep the rules.
Now I'm going to break them in a big way.
Just hold him still.
Bear, afleggen.
- Sit.
- Well, that was a big help.
You said we had a number?
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.
Honor student at school, degree in engineering.
She's worked for the last year at a military charity, Homes for Our Returning Heroes.
Maybe because her younger brother was killed in Afghanistan 18 months ago.
She quit the charity a week ago.
She's now working as a temp in a city planning office.
- Any threats?
- Not that I can see.
But some anomalies.
She dumped her phone five days ago, moved out of her apartment.
In fact, the only way I could trace her was through the temp agency.
She's hiding from someone.
I'd better get eyes on her.
It's your turn to dry him.
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.
Mr. Reese, he's your dog.
You'll manage.
Detective.
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?
I'm free tonight, as it happens.
Sorry, I got a case I'm looking at.
Him, actually.
Davidson.
The Internal Affairs cop went missing last winter.
You know him?
Know him?
Had some run-ins with him.
What's your interest?
I got a tip, anonymous.
Said a cop killed him.
Whoa.
Maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.
Maybe an HR cop took him out.
I heard of one group out of the 51st that was offing dealers, selling their supply.
You got any names?
Most of them are behind bars, or dead, but not all.
Will you excuse us?
Detective Carter, we need to talk.
I'll catch up with you later.
With HR degraded to the point of irrelevance my team is shifting priorities back to the Man in the Suit.
He's still out there.
You still wanna catch him?
Yes, of course.
Good.
We have new information.
Including who he's working for.
The Bureau's been tracking the emergence of private intelligence networks.
Like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.
They've got technology, serious resources and they've been buying up talent.
For instance, we think Mark Snow, the CIA agent who contacted you may also have been recruited.
Possibly by the Man in the Suit.
Really?
Snow?
It makes sense.
Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA he catches him, then the Man in the Suit flips him.
Gets Snow to be his asset.
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified.
I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the Bureau.
I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.
Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.
Please think about it.
I will.
Thank you.
Thanks.
- Carter.
- Hello, detective.
I need to find our friend.
We have a big problem.
You'll find him at the Department of City Planning.
So she just downloaded the file and walked out?
Yeah.
- Didn't anyone try to stop her?
- Apparently, nobody noticed.
Detective Carter.
What have we got?
You heard the 10-31 too, detective?
Yep.
So, what is it?
Uh, like we were telling Marshal Jennings here...
Marshal Jennings, huh?
The manager called it in because one of his staff Abby Monroe, downloaded a file illegally.
Walked out with it two hours ago.
No one noticed till too late.
Anyone know what's on the file?
We keep plans for important buildings.
All she took were engineering drawings for the 1400 block of Hanover, near Wall Street.
It's got an electrical sub-station, lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.
Anyone know where Abby Monroe lives?
We ran a check.
The address she gave us is fake.
Phone number is a pay phone.
Hey, solid background check, there.
What can I say?
She seemed like a sweet kid.
Kind of disappointing to find she's a flake.
Kids.
You never know, right, detective?
Right.
Anyway, good job following up so quickly.
Gentlemen.
Thank you, marshal.
Uh, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.
John.
John?
Are you out of your mind?
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star.
He wasn't using it anymore.
It's great.
Flash a badge, people tell you everything.
You gotta stop.
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the Man in the Suit.
He has a new theory.
That I'm working for China or something?
We heard.
We also heard his offer.
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.
Do you listen to all of my conversations?
More or less.
You're looking nice, Carter.
Maybe this Cal Beecher's good for you too.
Long as he treats you right.
He messes with you, he'll hear from me.
Okay.
Look, we're going to have to set some boundaries here.
Sure.
Things get heavy with you and Cal, we'll tune out right away.
Never mind.
What's the deal with Abby Monroe?
I was checking she wasn't in trouble.
Looks like I'm a bit late.
Can you get me footage from that camera?
From about two hours ago?
And that camera too?
Thank you.
There's Abby.
Were you able to trace the owner of the motorcycle, detective?
No.
It was stolen from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.
Got the camera tapes out of the Robbery Squad.
Let's see.
The perp is a single male--
You looking at the footage now?
- Yes.
Why?
- No reason.
He blew the locks with det cord.
Ignored the alarms because he knew it would be less than 30 seconds.
He broke the key case with his bare hand.
Chose his machine.
Whoa.
That's impressive.
What?
What is going on here?
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too?
What did I say about setting boundaries?
That's a prosthetic hand.
High-end prosthetic.
Use of det cord to gain entry into a building.
My guess?
Ex-military.
Might explain his connection to Abby.
Question is, what are they doing?
You're not gonna like the answer.
Comp Stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.
Same motorcycle was seen on a traffic light camera near a robbery at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.
- What was stolen?
- Explosives.
- Semtex.
- Twenty pounds of it.
And blasting caps.
Theft of explosives theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.
He could be the next Timothy McVeigh.
And your girl is working with him.
Maybe he manipulated her into getting involved.
She's still involved.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.
We've got to find her first.
You work at the 55.
You know a Narco detective named Cal Beecher?
Sure do.
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.
Better suits, better cars, better girls than the rest of us.
Maybe he just had better taste.
- Or maybe he was on the take.
- Did I say that?
What are you saying?
He was undercover Narcotics.
A lot of buy-and-busts a lot of money hanging around.
Anyway, why you wanna know?
I've just been seeing him around.
He's been hanging around Detective Carter.
Bees like honey, Fusco.
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
The way Abby went off the grid, cut all ties she's planning something.
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?
Her boyfriend might.
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.
We are an odd bunch, Finch.
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism--
Which would be a relevant crime.
--the machine would have given her number to whoever now runs that end of things at the government, not to us.
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat, the issues must be personal.
Fine.
But what leads do we have left?
We have two.
First, the pay phone number she gave the temp agency.
A street corner in Queens.
The agency must have been able to contact her there.
Might give you a clue where she's living.
Okay.
And the second lead?
The one stable point in her life, the charity.
Homes for Our Returning Heroes.
I'll check it out.
Good.
You need to get out more.
You're in a good mood.
I woke up this morning and felt-- Took me a while to put my finger on it.
--I felt happy.
Must be this job.
I'm glad.
Sorry, Bear, not now.
Abby tapped into that pay phone.
Think I found where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.
Josh Monroe.
Abby's little brother.
I'm an old friend of Abby's family.
As I was visiting New York, they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is and why she left her job here.
She never told them?
I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.
Fire her?
What on earth for?
Stealing.
At first it was just petty cash and I let it go thinking it was simple carelessness.
But then I found she was sneaking into the charity's accounts trying to move money around, significant amounts.
Mr. Chapple, that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.
Unfortunately, it's true.
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.
Any hint of a scandal and our donations would dry right up.
Abby had to go.
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
If you're watching this you'll know I'm in trouble.
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was 8, ha.
That time I tied Josh to his skateboard and pushed him down the hill in front of our house to see how fast he would go.
Since then I've always tried to be good.
Keep the rules.
But now I'm gonna break them in a big way.
Why?
Well, it's complicated, and it's simple.
I'm doing it because it's right.
And I know Josh would agree with me.
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him, and I know he'd be proud of me.
Just like I hope you are when you know the truth.
I love you.
And I hope you never have to see this.
Any idea why she started stealing?
I believe the trouble started when she met a former Marine.
They'd talk when he came by the offices.
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby because just about that time, she started stealing.
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?
I'm sorry, we have a strict confidentiality agreement with all our loan recipients.
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.
Could you at least tell me his name?
Corporal Shayn Coleman.
Explosives ordnance disposal expert.
Lost his right arm defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.
He's our motorcycle thief.
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.
They haven't seen him in more than two months.
They know he was in trouble?
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on, and his fiancée dumped him.
Must be why he went to Chapple to ask for another loan.
However it happened, this is more than enough to tip someone over the edge.
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.
Do what you have to do, detective.
Finch?
You still there?
Yes.
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.
What are they like?
Like you, to be honest.
Low-key and vaguely menacing.
I suspect he's telling them to follow me via the GPS transponder he slipped in my pocket as I was leaving.
Where's the transponder now?
On a laundry van with New Jersey plates.
Nice work, Finch.
Obviously Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.
What she's planning must connect to him too.
When the charity closes, I'll go back in.
When I said you need to get out more, I didn't mean that.
Let me take care of it.
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese.
And Abby is still our priority.
You wait for her.
I'll go back in, see what exactly Chapple's hiding.
I'm inside.
The alarm has been tampered with.
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.
What was that?
Finch, get out now!
- Who the hell are you?
- Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?
The same as you, and since you've woke the whole building, we'd better hurry.
I'm on my way.
Please just walk away now, Finch.
- Aah!
- Shh.
- Who are you?
Let go of me!
- It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you.
Finch, get out now.
I've got Abby.
Just get out of there.
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.
Please don't do that.
Then get off me.
Let me go.
Please, no guns.
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.
There they go.
Stop right there!
Get on or they'll kill you!
Get on!
Finch, are you okay?
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally I'm fine.
I'll be in touch.
Well done.
Hello, Abby.
I'm John.
Okay, you should leave now.
My boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.
Your boyfriend, Shayn?
I don't know how you know that, but, yes.
And he's a Marine, so you do not want to meet him.
Actually, I do want to meet him.
But first, what does that message to your mom and dad mean?
What?
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?
Get out!
- Or I'm--
- What?
You'll call the police?
I know about the building plans and the explosives.
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.
No, but I'm interested to know why you and Shayn are going after him.
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief.
And I'm not saying another word until you tell me who you are.
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.
Not what I asked.
Who are you?
I find it hard to answer that, even to myself.
I was a soldier once, like your brother, Josh.
But I was lucky, I made it out.
Mr. Reese?
Yes, Finch.
What's happening?
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.
Did he believe you?
No.
Especially when I told him that you have Abby.
Things are a little tense.
Let me talk to him.
Who is this?
Abby keeps asking me the same thing.
It's really not important.
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.
The same goes for you and my friend.
We should meet.
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.
Whatever you're planning, I know why.
You couldn't save your brother, so you're trying to save Shayn.
I understand that, truly.
I'd feel the same way.
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.
By lending him money?
Yes.
Chapple made him a loan, and the interest rates tripled in a year.
No one could keep up those payments.
Millions of people lost their homes.
They don't go around stealing explosives.
Shayn should move on.
He lost his home and his fiancée.
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple one of whom shot himself on the porch of the house he no longer owned.
Should he move on from that?
I went through Chapple's files, I saw what he was doing.
There are hundreds, hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.
What are you gonna do, Abby?
The right thing.
Can I go now?
I assume you put a tracker on him.
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors via a wireless link.
So I cloned the link and reprogrammed it to attempt a forced pair with every cell phone they pass.
Leaving a nice GPS trail.
Well done, Finch.
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle.
Which was exhilarating, by the way.
I might have to get myself one.
You working late?
Uh, yeah.
Um, heh, it's always something, you know?
Yeah.
Something wrong, Carter?
Donnelly made me an offer today.
I got competition?
From that guy?
No, not that sort of offer.
He, um, invited me to join the FBI.
Could be a good move.
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond.
But think of the prospects.
And the money.
You should do it.
What about my kid?
It will probably mean I have to move out of New York.
- You mean I'd never see you again?
- Ha, ha.
It's Cal.
No problem.
I'll see you then.
Uh, what were we talking about?
About never seeing me again.
Right.
- It's Cal.
- Cal?
AlonZo Quinn.
Can we meet?
Tidal Park.
Say, 30 minutes?
No problem.
I'm hoping you can help me out.
Any way I can, Mr. Quinn.
The mayor's seen this crime spike in Crown Heights.
Drug busts, burglaries, even homicides.
He wants me to find out what's happening.
I told him I got a godson who's got his ear to the ground.
Do you?
Crown Heights.
Yeah.
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.
Used to work Brighton Beach until Elias kicked him out.
We believe he's pulling strings from inside.
Working to take over the Heights.
Boo.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
Keeping an eye on you, you slippery little mutt.
What are you doing?
None of your business.
You're following Cal Beecher.
Checking him out for Carter.
No, I been wondering who else you been flapping your gums to.
About you burying Davidson?
Not Beecher.
Not yet.
You crossed a line when you called Carter.
Pointing her towards me in Davidson's murder.
What line is that?
The line where I don't give a crap anymore.
So watch your back.
Know how many times I've heard that?
But here I am, beautiful as ever.
Go home, Fusco.
What are you doing here, Simmons?
I said, go home.
There's our cell phone trail.
Abby and Shayn are heading for the 1400 block of Hanover.
Question is, what's there?
I've listed every business on the block.
Cross-checking against the download of Chapple's computer.
Bingo.
An investment bank, Merton Watts.
Maybe he has an account there.
Not according to his computer records.
- A safe-deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?
According to his accounts, he's not rich.
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made were foreclosed on.
If he's getting kickbacks from the banks...
You may be right.
Merton Watts has first lien on any properties Chapple loans money on.
They handle all foreclosure sales.
Split the profits with Chapple, which he keeps in his safe-deposit box at the bank.
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?
Yes.
And for her brother.
She still feels a debt.
The dead have a power like that, as you know.
So how are they going to do this?
Semtex and building plans.
They'll find a soft entry point, then blast their way into the vault.
I like these kids.
I'd like them to live.
Please try to get to them before Chapple's thugs do.
System's back up.
They get anything from the safe?
The box code and the keys.
There's no way they can get into the vault, is there?
What do you think?
They stole explosives and engineering plans.
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.
You have to pay for another man.
It's a big area to cover.
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.
Carter, I need to see you immediately.
Can I have your phone?
What's going on, Donnelly?
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for has some sophisticated capabilities.
Like wire-tapping cops.
Has something happened?
I think we got our break.
The Man in the Suit was involved in a robbery at a charity on the Upper East Side.
How do you know that?
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know if you'll accept the temporary assignment with the Bureau.
Okay, yes.
Good.
You won't regret it.
So we've been tracking this man for 10 months.
Every time we get close, he slips out from under us as if he has some guardian angel.
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead.
And then I realized, the phone.
He's in constant communication with his handlers.
I've cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at with cell tower logs of IMEIs, came up with nothing.
Exactly.
Nothing.
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic from the night he gave us the slip downtown.
Under the wireless and radio noise, they found bursts of a cloned IMEI with a unique signature.
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.
Twenty-four hours ago the cluster came online.
It spotted another burst of cloned IMEIs at the exact time and location of the robbery.
It's him.
I've got SWAT teams standing by.
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.
Abby, this is far enough.
I'll handle this from here.
I'll meet you back at the apartment.
No.
No, together or nothing.
You've risked enough, Abby.
This isn't your fight right now.
This is my fight.
You're my fight.
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
Now, the truth.
Or I take you to the cops myself.
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.
What then?
We wanna give it back to the people he stole from.
How?
We haven't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought very far at all.
Why not go to the cops or a lawyer?
Abby did.
She went to the DA.
But Chapple got their first, spread his poison.
The DA threatened to prosecute her for theft and slander.
When I got to my apartment, one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.
He beat me up.
He said if I said another word, he'd come back and put a bullet in my head.
I assume the bank's through there.
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.
John, this has gone far enough.
Has it, Finch?
Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.
Chapple hurt them, Finch.
They tried the law, the law wasn't interested.
What have they got left?
Besides, I've always had a thing about people who screw with veterans.
John, it's far too risky.
What'd you say, Harold?
No such thing as a risk-free life.
Let's do it.
Wait for the subway.
Now.
This is where the safe-deposit boxes are.
We couldn't get to them from inside the bank, so we decided to bring them to us.
You're going to blow the roof.
We got something here.
John, what's your situation?
Ten more minutes.
I'm seeing what I can only describe as interference on our phone link.
Is it Root?
No.
It's a broad-spectrum sweep.
Heavy-duty computer power.
Root's more subtle than that.
It must be our FBI friend.
Stay off the line, and, please, get out now.
If Abby and Shayn won't come, leave them.
I don't leave people.
And they're bringing down a very bad man.
Isn't that what your experiment is all about?
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed, not robbing banks.
Five minutes and we're out.
In three, two, one.
Let's go.
There, 158.
His account's in a bank in Venezuela.
- Is this what you need?
- Is it ever.
There's more than 30 million here.
His charity stole 30 million.
Then let's go.
Back the way we came.
Get down.
You okay?
Karma at last.
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?
The bank opens in 30 minutes.
We gotta get out before then.
Hang tight.
911 call.
Possible underground explosion near Wall Street.
Tracking IMEI bursts in the same area.
It's him.
We hook up with SWAT en route.
You with us?
- Of course, I just need to make a phone call.
- Make it quick.
Hi, Mom.
Can you make sure Taylor gets to school?
You been drinking, Carter?
Tell Harold Donnelly's headed to Wall Street.
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phone.
Okay, Mom.
Yes.
Thank you.
I love you.
Wherever Wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street.
That's where Donnelly's heading.
That's where John is.
Merton Watts Investment bank, Hanover Street.
Plus, Carter said he's up on your phones.
As I feared.
Anything you can do to run interference for us at the bank I would be most grateful.
I take it you know this gentleman.
Pete Yogorov, enforcer for the Russian mob.
At least he used to be, until Elias took out his old man.
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.
To hit back at Elias?
To build another revenue stream.
Yogorov is at MCC awaiting trial with his little brother, Lazlo.
DA's got him dead to rights on a dozen different counts.
Maybe we can do something about that.
You need something on the District Attorney?
Let me handle that.
By going all Spartan on our emissaries Elias has made it clear.
That relationship is over.
We need new friends.
You want me to talk to the Russians, open negotiation?
They have all the right pieces, but with us behind them cash flow will no longer be an issue.
Understood, boss.
Just heard something interesting.
That pain in the ass, Donnelly, finally caught up with the Man in the Suit.
Not even 7 a.m. and already a perfect day.
Bank's about to open, John.
Where are you?
Mr. Reese?
What's happening?
Hate to say this, but we're in a bit of a pickle.
Get upstairs to the foyer.
I have IDs and passes for all of you.
Cover us.
What are you looking for?
Clothes.
You need to get changed.
We're going to dress up like bankers.
We're going to climb up there and walk right out the front door.
Base picked up a burst of comms from the target.
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.
You can track him, but you can't hear what he's saying?
Do you know who he's talking to?
Not yet.
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.
You've done enough.
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
We all got ourselves into this mess.
We're all going to get ourselves out.
When you get to the foyer, look for Harold.
I'll be right behind you.
Now.
Next, please.
- Looks like nothing's going on inside.
- Signal's still active.
The 911 call said the explosion was underground.
He's in there.
One team in front, second team around the back.
We move in 30.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I am a client here at the bank.
I need to get into the vault now.
Hello.
Here, take these.
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.
Where's John?
FBI!
Please back against the wall!
- Stay where you are.
- Don't move!
Hands up!
See your hands.
- Foyer's secure.
- Check every ID.
No one leaves.
- Half your men here, half with me.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go!
- You, don't move.
- See your ID, please?
John, can you hear me?
Shayn and Abby are safe.
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.
We got company.
Lose your weapons and get the hell out.
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.
This is Delta.
Vault level secure.
Not going to make it, Harold.
Sorry.
I screwed up.
But I meant what I said yesterday.
So thanks, Harold.
It was fun.
John?
ID?
Harold Wren.
Universal Heritage Insurance.
My associates.
Why are you in the bank?
We have a meeting with the VP of Corporate Strategy.
Your ID.
Did you get what you wanted?
All the money Chapple stole.
More than 30 million.
Can you do anything with the accounts?
Yes.
I'll empty them.
Deposit every last cent in the accounts of reputable military charities.
Will that do?
Then I have to get you out of here and out of this state.
As long as we're together.
Check the top level.
Check down back.
Don't worry, I got you covered.
What about John?
We finally got you.
Sir.
There's a problem.
Step back.
Well, do you recognize him?
Uh...
No.
Cuff them all.
"Melissa Joey" is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
Boy in film:
We can't do it, mom.
We'll never beat those guys.
Mom:
Well, Cody, you've got something that big-city team doesn't have--
- You've got a whole town that believes in you. - ( Crying )
I believe in you, Cody.
- Tissue?
- No.
( Crowd in film cheering )
- ( Cellphone rings )
- Yo, not much.
Just watching a movie.
Nah, it's pretty lame.
- Crowd:
Shh!
- How many calls is this guy gonna take?
- Someone should shove that phone down his throat.
- ( Man laughs )
- It'd be my pleasure.
- No, Joe.
Look, I'd like to deck him too, but we can't in front of the kids.
- Man:
Yeah, well--
- Damn it.
Why did we bring the kids?
Kids ruin everything.
We can hear you, you know.
So you saw this one?
- Oh my God.
- ( Mel sighs )
- The kid loses the big game?
- ( People moan )
Someone has to talk to this guy.
I'm gonna talk to him with Mr. Chuck and Mr. Norris.
Joe, we have to set a good example.
- Since when?
- I read this in a magazine about controlling your temper.
It was a dog magazine, but the same principle applies.
So how's your brother?
Is he still a douche?
Oh, go get an usher.
I'll be right back.
- Man:
Nah, I got time.
- Hey, you are making it
- really hard for me to watch this movie.
- ( Beeps )
You know what's making it hard for me to watch this movie?
This beanpole freak of nature here blocking my view.
( Gasps ) You did not touch him!
- I think I did.
- No, you don't touch him.
- Or what?
- ( People murmuring )
Or I will get the manager.
You go do that, blondielocks.
- You go do that.
- ( Scoffs )
- ( Woman gasps ) - ( Lennox laughing )
( Crowd cheers )
We're good.
He's quieted down.

Morning, Mel.
I was just gonna beat these eggs, but I figure you might wanna do it, 'cause one punch-- boom-- omelet.
Let's get ready to scramble!
Okay, if this is about last night,
I totally regret my actions.
That punch was not who I am.
What, are you more of an ear-biter?
You know what's so great about what happened last night, Councilwoman?
After months of you calling me a hothead, who's the one who decks in the movie theater?
Hold on, let me savor this deliciousness.
You.
You know why?
Because you are just like me.
Ha!
I am nothing like you.
You know, sometimes even a rational person can be pushed to a point, for instance, when her cub is threatened.
Cub?
This kid is like 8 feet tall.
- You really wanna poke the mama bear?
- ( Chuckles )?
Can we just move on?
I don't want this to define me, you know?
Would you wanna be known only as the guy who worked for that company that swindled people outonly as of billions of dollars?
That is all I'm known for.
Hey, Aunt Mel, look.
Somebody shot video of you at the movie theater last night.
- You've gone viral.
- Oh.
"Blonde decks cellphone guy.
Who is this hot-headed hottie?"
You're not gonna let someone else take credit for that, are you?
Yes, I am.
The Internet and I are already very well acquainted.
That's for sure.
Whatever you do, do not Google "Ohio senator's daughter flashes world"
stepping out of a limo in a short skirt."
Hey, it was laundry day.
You did a lot of laundry back then.
Harper, this is not a good time for a meeting.
We had an appointment.
Hey, you're lucky I showed up.
My ovary's the size of a baseball.
- So no donut holes for me.
- The news is bad, Mel- poop-hitting-the-fan bad.
- Well, what was I supposed to do?
He threatened me and my entire family.
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about the polling research.
As am I.
I am here to get you re-elected.
Do you see this line here?
Like my estrogen, you are trending down.
You just don't have a strong enough brand.
30% of the respondents think that you're that perky weather girl who's banging the mayor.
- Uck!
I would never.
- Uck all you want, but people know who she is.
And it wouldn't kill you to wear a push-up bra.
Wait, 4% of people think Mel Burke is a city in Australia?
People don't know who you are or they just don't see you at all.
Where's Mel?
I don't see Mel.
Oh. ( Laughs )
There you are.
Someone just sent this to me.
Is this you coldcocking a guy at the movies?
- Not now, not now.
- Oh, this is what you're trying to cover up?
I lost my head, okay?
This is not who I am.
I'm a negotiator, a consensus maker.
This video makes me look like a short, white, female Mike Tyson.
No no no, this is sick.
I love it.
You know, voters always worry that a woman in public office isn't tough enough, that she can't handle a fight.
I can totally spin this like a dreidel.
Well, how are you gonna make assault and battery seem reasonable and rational?
Like this: "Finally someone has the big, blonde cojones
"to deal with one of those movie-theater jerks.
"Three cheers for Councilwoman Mel Burke."
- Whoa!
What are you, insane?
- Oh, for sure.
And from now on, you're gonna be known as fighter for the little people.
- Yay, little people!
- Yeah.
Okay, look, Harper, I know you've turned around a lot of campaigns
I never lose.
And don't you feel the same way that I do, other unbiased citizen?
Yes.
Boy, do I.
Well, then let your voice be heard in the comment section right there.
"Battling Burke sure gets my vote."
Who says women can't dish it out?
Not me, because fundamentally--
- Send.
Send, Stephanie.
- Whoa whoa, wait wait wait wait.
Are we sure this is the smartest strategy?
Maybe we should all just take a breath here.
- Sure, after you press "send." - ( Beeps )
( Laughs ) Now we can all breathe.
( Strained ) Not yet.
( School bell rings )
Wow, I recognize that burrito from my old school.
I heard it got pregnant and dropped out.
( Laughs ) Whatever, I'm hungry.
Creepy new girl Hester eats by herself at that table every single day.
What makes you think she's creepy?
Her general creepitude.
She never talks to anybody.
She just scribbles in her little book and eats walnuts- nothing but walnuts.
- She's just new.
I was new last year.
It's hard.
Yeah, I remember.
I hated you last year.
Hey, one person can make a difference.
It's Hester, right?
This may be a few weeks late, but welcome to Grant High School.
- Who are you?
- Oh.
I'm your new friend-- Lennox Scanlon.
You wanna share an unwed burrito from the '90s?
Amazing-- 537 comments already?
This could move my commando picture to the second page of my Google search...
If such photos existed.
Oh, here's another one.
"God bless battling Mel Burke for making our movie theaters safe again.
And how great is her hair?"
- ( Laughs )
- Even in a brawl it holds its curl.
- The public has spoken.
- Bye-bye, weak polling data.
- And hello second term.
- Yes.
( Snapping out of sync )
Thanks for coming over to my house.
Well, you didn't leave me much choice.
Yeah, but this'll be fun.
I mean a new friend?
How great is that?
'Cause you and I have so much in common.
You have colitis too?
No, I mean I write all the time and I see you writing.
You know, you and me, us writers-- we both have words just exploding out of us, right?
You sure do.
Can I get you something to eat?
I know you like walnuts.
We even have pistachios if you wanna go nuts.
How long is this playdate supposed to last?
Hey, Lennox.
Hey, Lennox's friend.
I'm not technically her friend.
But I'm working on it.
Apparently I'm her project.
She's entering me in the science fair.
( Laughs ) No.
No.
It's just a little back-and-forth thing we do.
You know, she's the dry one, I'm the goofy one.
Anyway, Hester, this is Joe and he and I are gonna
- get you that snack.
- Okay.
- ( Chuckles ) - ( Chuckles nervously )
- We're gonna go over--
- Yeah.
Wow, she's a happy one.
I invited her over because she's new.
To what, the human race?
Okay, I was new last year.
I had a hard time fitting in, and I'm gonna do for her what someone should've done for me.
Get her a personality transplant?
Make her a friend.
Bring her out of her shell.
You don't understand, Joe.
She's me.
Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror.
- Hey.
- Hey there.
Oh, so tell me-- any backlash today from the two-fisted justice you dispensed in the movie theater last night?
No, it did not come up.
Great, so you can just put it behind you,
- pretend like it never happened.
- Exactly my plan.
Nice.
Nice.
Oh, on a totally unrelated matter, these drawings of you wearing boxing gloves were faxed over from your office today.
I like this concept four here the best, 'cause I think it truly captures the bloodlust.
Well, how do you even know those are me?
Well, because it says "Battling Burke."
It's just a little idea my campaign consultant had.
- For a mailer.
It's a metaphor.
- Metaphor?
Is that the new, hip term for "you're kidding yourself"?
Joe, the video went viral.
At least now we're in control of the message.
I wasn't so sure this morning, but this is turning out to be a very good day.
This might've been the worst day ever.
Well, it didn't have anything to do with my bada-bing, did it?
Oh, it had everything to do with your bada-bing.
To everyone on earth with a computer or phone,
I'm the big weenie whose little blonde aunt had to defend him in the movie theater.
Oh, don't worry about that, buddy.
All the kids are gonna forget about that as soon as this whole Internet fad is over.
And this one 11th grade kid,
Donnie Keaton, would not let it go, and I was with Holly.
Dude dissed me in front of my woman.
And you just walked away, right?
No, I told him to knock it off and then- then he challenged me to a fight.
- And then you walked away?
I couldn't do that.
I was with Holly.
- I have a reputation.
- No, I don't think you do, bud.
Ryder, you do know that fighting is the wrong way to resolve an issue?
What, so if he hits me, I just don't hit back?
Now wouldn't that be a powerful statement?
- ( Cellphone rings )
- Think about it.
Hey, Harper.
Yeah, I'm looking at the concepts now.
Hey, what do you think about pink boxing gloves?
- Okay, Joe, you gotta help me.
- No, man.
There's no way I'm teaching you how to fight.
- Aunt Mel wouldn't have to know.
- Yes, Ryder, but I would know.
I'm just kidding, man.
Oh yeah, who's the weenie now, huh?
Not me.
My nanny's teaching me how to fight.
So is it true that most bullies are just talk?
No, they can kick some serious ass.
All right, are you ready?
Here we go.
- I'm coming at you.
- Oh, dude.
- Ow.
- Ow?
You're supposed to block.
That was the strategy, remember?
You're just gonna let this bully punch himself out.
How do you know so much about boxing?
Because in my neighborhood, you had to learn how to defend yourself.
I took out many a bully twice my size.
- So your dad taught you?
- No, my mom...
And my Aunt Cecilia.
Yeah, you did not want to mess with those ladies.
All right, here we go.
Punch, let's go.
- One, two
- Joe.
- Oh hey, hi.
We're not doing anything.
Beat each other senseless.
I don't care.
I'm looking for my notebook-- the spiral one with all my English lit notes in it?
Here, hold these.
I'll be right back.
It was right here on the table when you were working here with, um-- what's her name?
Beetlejuice.
Her name is Hester.
Oh, well, then just borrow Hester's notes.
She didn't take any.
She's having a really hard time adjusting to a new school.
No one even talks to her.
Well, except for me because I'm a good person.
Well, good person, since you took notes and she didn't take any I think you got yourself a thief.
Looks like Hester is a heister.
What's your evidence?
Um, she was over here, she looks creepy-- she did it.
Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
Oh, sweetie, that's just an expression.
I would bet it's in that big, ratty backpack of hers.
Well, there's no way to verify your wild, paranoid theory.
You're right.
It'd be impossible to find it unless we get her back over here and go through it.
Fine, I will do that.
Just to prove how wrong you are.
You know what, Lennox?
I thought I was wrong once.
Turns out I was mistaken.
We need to go.
You're due at the Armory.
You'll speak, shake some hands and then we'll head over to the athletic club.
You're booked solid for the next week.
- Everybody loves Battling Burke.
- You know, I gotta say at first I wasn't so sure, but this is kinda fun.
It says "express line,"
"eight items or less."
You've got 15 things here.
I'm already here.
What's the big whoop?
It's people like you that ruin it for everybody else.
( Scoffs )
Hey, it's Mel Burke.
Battlin' Burke!
- ( Chuckles ) Hey.
- ( All talking )
Mel, Mel, look what this guy's doing.
- It's injustice!
- Well, it's not exactly injustice.
It's just maybe a little annoying.
Come on, punch him out like in the video.
- ( People talking )
- Okay, come on, everybody.
Is violence really the way to solve this?
- Woman:
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
- People:
Yeah.
- Sir, can we just talk about this?
- ( Gasps )
( Laughs ) You did it.
- Justice!
- ( Crowd cheering )
Another evil-doer put in his place by Battling Burke!
( Crowd cheers ) Burke!
Burke!
Burke!
Burke!
Burke!
Refill your ice tea there, Hester?
Fourth one's the charm.
No, I can't drink any more.
- Where's your bathroom?
- Top of the stairs to the left.
- Clear.
- That took a lot more ice tea than I thought.
I know, she must have a huge bladder.
All right, let's see what's in here.
Here we-- uck.
All right, what do we got?
We got a sweater, book,
- shrunken head--
- You're kidding.
Yes, I am.
It's an avocado.
Wait a minute, what-- what's this?
- Oh, that look familiar?
- Oh my gosh,
- that's my notebook.
- Shocker.
- What are you doing?
- You stole my notebook.
- How could you do that to me?
- I don't know.
You were offering me nuts and stuff
- and so I figured--
- That my notebook was up for grabs too?
I guess, yeah.
So am I really the first person to tell you that stealing is wrong?
The first person to spit when she said it.
Okay, let me give you the whole rundown of how life works.
Don't steal.
Be nice to people.
- Smile every once in a while.
- All right, easy, girl.
And, you know, there are other foods in the world besides walnuts.
Return kindness when kindness is offered to you,
- and I was fricking kind to you.
- You're spitting again.
I mean, seriously, didn't you ever go to kindergarten?
I think I should go.
Your notes weren't even that good.
Oh!
Well, you know how I said that we're so much alike?
I was wrong.
You're nothing like me.
I am a sweet, wonderful person who gives and gives and gives!
- Hoo!
- Come back and see us again, Hester.
I can't believe it.
After everything I did for her.
Yeah.
Oh, that's the look you give Aunt Mel.
That's the I-told- you-so look.
Lennox, you actually think I like being right all the time?
Well, I do.
So I take one step towards him and he tears out of the door.
And everybody's yelling "Burke him!"
Look at you, girl-- you're a verb.
I like it.
"Out of my way, you dumb bastard, or I'll burke ya."
Now that's branding.
Come here.
Stand over here.
- Okay.
- Hey, Harper, I'm sorry I ever questioned you.
Now you know better.
Okay, let's get you re-elected.
- Now do this.
Give me your killer look.
- ( Camera clicking )
Maybe your other killer look.
Mmm, maybe just smile.
( Camera clicking )
Hey, awesome day, best day ever.
Ryder!
Oh my gosh, what happened to your lip?
So Donnie Keaton ambushes me after 4th period...
- That's terrible.
- And, Joe, Joe, your strategy worked.
Donnie punched and punched, and I ducked and dodged and waited for my opening and then...
( Grunts ) I burked him.
- Yes.
- You burked him?
See?
It's catching on.
I'm making T-shirts, getting my graphics guy on it right now.
Way to go, buddy.
I gotta call my mom and let her know, 'cause it's her move.
Well, hers and, um, Muhammad Ali's.
Whoa whoa, you fought him?
You know, that's not the way you settle a disagreement.
Oh, stop it, Burke.
You're proud as hell.
You know how I know that?
Because I'm proud and you are just like me.
- I am nothing like you.
- Sure you are.
You pretend to be all civilized, but at the end of the day when push comes to shove, you shove.
( Knocks ) Is this Ryder Scanlon's house?
Who's asking?
Who's responsible for the thug that beat up my son Donny?
The person wearing the boxing gloves.
Look, I'm not looking for a fight.
How would you like a little taste of what my son got today?
Whoa whoa, lady, lady.
Let's just all be civilized here, okay?
( Chuckles )
Put these on.
No no no no.
You know what?
No more fighting.
We are done behaving like animals.
Ryder, what I did in the movie theater was wrong, what you did to Donnie was wrong and what Donnie did to Ryder was wrong.
What kind of message are we sending our kids?
I don't know-- that one?
Yeah, well, Mel Burke is rebranding.
I am taking off the gloves, now and forever.
Maybe not right now, but as soon as I find a saw.
Okay, look, here's what I think we should do--
I'm gonna spend some time with my nephew,
I think you should go home and look after your son.
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.
I will.
I think we're both sorry about what happened here.
You look familiar.
Are you that weather girl on Channel 5?
I am.
Smart move not fighting her, Burke.
I don't think you were quite in her weight class.
Ryder, go put some ice on that.
I'll be in the kitchen in a minute.
I hope it leaves a scar.
Chicks dig scars.
Yeah, they do.
Hey, it's time to retire Battling Burke.
All right, all right, but before we do that-- a moment ago when she was shoving you, there wasn't something deep down inside where you just wanted to pop her back?
No, not pop her.
- Bitch slap her.
- See, that what I'm talking about.
Everybody's got an aggressive streak.
It's just how you channel it.
It's how you work it out.
Tell you what-- let's work a little of your aggression out right here, okay?
Gimme a good one.
Come on.
Nice nice nice nice.
Okay, now-- wait wait.
Try to pop me right here. ( Clicks tongue )
- I don't wanna.
- Come on, you can do it.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on.
Are you kidding me?
This is stupid.
I've got no more fight left.
- I give up.
- ( Chuckles ) Okay.
- ( Grunts ) - ( Laughs )
♪ Ha!
You got burked. ♪
So, flying solo today, uh?
Where's your uhm... sweet, psychotic friend?
She got back to the mother ship?
Hester has actually cleaned up her act.
She says hello to people at lunch, she smiles once in a while, she's even trying other nuts.
Wow, so you like berated her into being a better person.
I did. (laughs) Just like I said I would.
Oh Jeez, I know that look.
That's the look I get from your aunt all the time when she thinks she's been right all along.
And you don't like that look.
No... you know, kind of used to it.
"Melissa Joey" is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
Boy in film:
We can't do it, mom.
We'll never beat those guys.
Mom:
Well, Cody, you've got something that big-city team doesn't have--
- You've got a whole town that believes in you. - ( Crying )
I believe in you, Cody.
- Tissue?
- No.
( Crowd in film cheering )
- ( Cellphone rings )
- Yo, not much.
Just watching a movie.
Nah, it's pretty lame.
- Crowd:
Shh!
- How many calls is this guy gonna take?
- Someone should shove that phone down his throat.
- ( Man laughs )
- It'd be my pleasure.
- No, Joe.
Look, I'd like to deck him too, but we can't in front of the kids.
- Man:
Yeah, well--
- Damn it.
Why did we bring the kids?
Kids ruin everything.
We can hear you, you know.
So you saw this one?
- Oh my God.
- ( Mel sighs )
- The kid loses the big game?
- ( People moan )
Someone has to talk to this guy.
I'm gonna talk to him with Mr. Chuck and Mr. Norris.
Joe, we have to set a good example.
- Since when?
- I read this in a magazine about controlling your temper.
It was a dog magazine, but the same principle applies.
So how's your brother?
Is he still a douche?
Oh, go get an usher.
I'll be right back.
- Man:
Nah, I got time.
- Hey, you are making it
- really hard for me to watch this movie.
- ( Beeps )
You know what's making it hard for me to watch this movie?
This beanpole freak of nature here blocking my view.
( Gasps ) You did not touch him!
- I think I did.
- No, you don't touch him.
- Or what?
- ( People murmuring )
Or I will get the manager.
You go do that, blondielocks.
- You go do that.
- ( Scoffs )
- ( Woman gasps ) - ( Lennox laughing )
( Crowd cheers )
We're good.
He's quieted down.

- ( Chuckles ) - ( Chuckles nervously )
- We're gonna go over--
- Yeah.
Wow, she's a happy one.
I invited her over because she's new.
To what, the human race?
Okay, I was new last year.
I had a hard time fitting in, and I'm gonna do for her what someone should've done for me.
Get her a personality transplant?
Make her a friend.
Bring her out of her shell.
You don't understand, Joe.
She's me.
Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror.
- Hey.
- Hey there.
Oh, so tell me-- any backlash today from the two-fisted justice you dispensed in the movie theater last night?
No, it did not come up.
Great, so you can just put it behind you,
- pretend like it never happened.
- Exactly my plan.
Nice.
Nice.
Oh, on a totally unrelated matter, these drawings of you wearing boxing gloves were faxed over from your office today.
I like this concept four here the best, 'cause I think it truly captures the bloodlust.
Well, how do you even know those are me?
Well, because it says "Battling Burke."
It's just a little idea my campaign consultant had.
- For a mailer.
It's a metaphor.
- Metaphor?
Is that the new, hip term for "you're kidding yourself"?
Joe, the video went viral.
At least now we're in control of the message.
I wasn't so sure this morning, but this is turning out to be a very good day.
This might've been the worst day ever.
Well, it didn't have anything to do with my bada-bing, did it?
Oh, it had everything to do with your bada-bing.
To everyone on earth with a computer or phone,
I'm the big weenie whose little blonde aunt had to defend him in the movie theater.
Oh, don't worry about that, buddy.
All the kids are gonna forget about that as soon as this whole Internet fad is over.
And this one 11th grade kid,
Donnie Keaton, would not let it go, and I was with Holly.
Dude dissed me in front of my woman.
And you just walked away, right?
No, I told him to knock it off and then- then he challenged me to a fight.
- And then you walked away?
I couldn't do that.
I was with Holly.
- I have a reputation.
- No, I don't think you do, bud.
Ryder, you do know that fighting is the wrong way to resolve an issue?
What, so if he hits me, I just don't hit back?
Now wouldn't that be a powerful statement?
- ( Cellphone rings )
- Think about it.
Hey, Harper.
Yeah, I'm looking at the concepts now.
Hey, what do you think about pink boxing gloves?
- Okay, Joe, you gotta help me.
- No, man.
There's no way I'm teaching you how to fight.
- Aunt Mel wouldn't have to know.
- Yes, Ryder, but I would know.
I'm just kidding, man.
Oh yeah, who's the weenie now, huh?
Not me.
My nanny's teaching me how to fight.
So is it true that most bullies are just talk?
No, they can kick some serious ass.
All right, are you ready?
Here we go.
- I'm coming at you.
- Oh, dude.
- Ow.
- Ow?
You're supposed to block.
That was the strategy, remember?
You're just gonna let this bully punch himself out.
How do you know so much about boxing?
Because in my neighborhood, you had to learn how to defend yourself.
I took out many a bully twice my size.
- So your dad taught you?
- No, my mom...
And my Aunt Cecilia.
Yeah, you did not want to mess with those ladies.
All right, here we go.
Punch, let's go.
- One, two
- Joe.
- Oh hey, hi.
We're not doing anything.
Beat each other senseless.
I don't care.
I'm looking for my notebook-- the spiral one with all my English lit notes in it?
Here, hold these.
I'll be right back.
It was right here on the table when you were working here with, um-- what's her name?
Beetlejuice.
Her name is Hester.
Oh, well, then just borrow Hester's notes.
She didn't take any.
She's having a really hard time adjusting to a new school.
No one even talks to her.
Well, except for me because I'm a good person.
Well, good person, since you took notes and she didn't take any I think you got yourself a thief.
Looks like Hester is a heister.
What's your evidence?
Um, she was over here, she looks creepy-- she did it.
Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
Oh, sweetie, that's just an expression.
I would bet it's in that big, ratty backpack of hers.
Well, there's no way to verify your wild, paranoid theory.
You're right.
It'd be impossible to find it unless we get her back over here and go through it.
Fine, I will do that.
Just to prove how wrong you are.
You know what, Lennox?
I thought I was wrong once.
Turns out I was mistaken.
We need to go.
You're due at the Armory.
You'll speak, shake some hands and then we'll head over to the athletic club.
You're booked solid for the next week.
- Everybody loves Battling Burke.
- You know, I gotta say at first I wasn't so sure, but this is kinda fun.
It says "express line,"
"eight items or less."
You've got 15 things here.
I'm already here.
What's the big whoop?
It's people like you that ruin it for everybody else.
( Scoffs )
Hey, it's Mel Burke.
Battlin' Burke!
- ( Chuckles ) Hey.
- ( All talking )
Mel, Mel, look what this guy's doing.
- It's injustice!
- Well, it's not exactly injustice.
It's just maybe a little annoying.
Come on, punch him out like in the video.
- ( People talking )
- Okay, come on, everybody.
Is violence really the way to solve this?
- Woman:
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
- People:
Yeah.
- Sir, can we just talk about this?
- ( Gasps )
( Laughs ) You did it.
- Justice!
- ( Crowd cheering )
Another evil-doer put in his place by Battling Burke!
( Crowd cheers ) Burke!
Burke!
Burke!
Burke!
Burke!
Refill your ice tea there, Hester?
Fourth one's the charm.
No, I can't drink any more.
- Where's your bathroom?
- Top of the stairs to the left.
- Clear.
- That took a lot more ice tea than I thought.
I know, she must have a huge bladder.
All right, let's see what's in here.
Here we-- uck.
All right, what do we got?
We got a sweater, book,
- shrunken head--
- You're kidding.
Yes, I am.
It's an avocado.
Wait a minute, what-- what's this?
- Oh, that look familiar?
- Oh my gosh,
- that's my notebook.
- Shocker.
- What are you doing?
- You stole my notebook.
- How could you do that to me?
- I don't know.
You were offering me nuts and stuff
- and so I figured--
- That my notebook was up for grabs too?
I guess, yeah.
So am I really the first person to tell you that stealing is wrong?
The first person to spit when she said it.
Okay, let me give you the whole rundown of how life works.
Don't steal.
Be nice to people.
- Smile every once in a while.
- All right, easy, girl.
And, you know, there are other foods in the world besides walnuts.
Return kindness when kindness is offered to you,
- and I was fricking kind to you.
- You're spitting again.
I mean, seriously, didn't you ever go to kindergarten?
I think I should go.
Your notes weren't even that good.
Oh!
Well, you know how I said that we're so much alike?
I was wrong.
You're nothing like me.
I am a sweet, wonderful person who gives and gives and gives!
- Hoo!
- Come back and see us again, Hester.
I can't believe it.
After everything I did for her.
Yeah.
Oh, that's the look you give Aunt Mel.
That's the I-told- you-so look.
Lennox, you actually think I like being right all the time?
Well, I do.
So I take one step towards him and he tears out of the door.
And everybody's yelling "Burke him!"
Look at you, girl-- you're a verb.
I like it.
"Out of my way, you dumb bastard, or I'll burke ya."
Now that's branding.
Come here.
Stand over here.
- Okay.
- Hey, Harper, I'm sorry I ever questioned you.
Now you know better.
Okay, let's get you re-elected.
- Now do this.
Give me your killer look.
- ( Camera clicking )
Maybe your other killer look.
Mmm, maybe just smile.
( Camera clicking )
Hey, awesome day, best day ever.
Ryder!
Oh my gosh, what happened to your lip?
So Donnie Keaton ambushes me after 4th period...
- That's terrible.
- And, Joe, Joe, your strategy worked.
Donnie punched and punched, and I ducked and dodged and waited for my opening and then...
( Grunts ) I burked him.
- Yes.
- You burked him?
See?
It's catching on.
I'm making T-shirts, getting my graphics guy on it right now.
Way to go, buddy.
I gotta call my mom and let her know, 'cause it's her move.
Well, hers and, um, Muhammad Ali's.
Whoa whoa, you fought him?
You know, that's not the way you settle a disagreement.
Oh, stop it, Burke.
You're proud as hell.
You know how I know that?
Because I'm proud and you are just like me.
- I am nothing like you.
- Sure you are.
You pretend to be all civilized, but at the end of the day when push comes to shove, you shove.
( Knocks ) Is this Ryder Scanlon's house?
Who's asking?
Who's responsible for the thug that beat up my son Donny?
The person wearing the boxing gloves.
Look, I'm not looking for a fight.
How would you like a little taste of what my son got today?
Whoa whoa, lady, lady.
Let's just all be civilized here, okay?
( Chuckles )
Put these on.
No no no no.
You know what?
No more fighting.
We are done behaving like animals.
Ryder, what I did in the movie theater was wrong, what you did to Donnie was wrong and what Donnie did to Ryder was wrong.
What kind of message are we sending our kids?
I don't know-- that one?
Yeah, well, Mel Burke is rebranding.
I am taking off the gloves, now and forever.
Maybe not right now, but as soon as I find a saw.
Okay, look, here's what I think we should do--
I'm gonna spend some time with my nephew,
I think you should go home and look after your son.
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.
I will.
I think we're both sorry about what happened here.
You look familiar.
Are you that weather girl on Channel 5?
I am.
Smart move not fighting her, Burke.
I don't think you were quite in her weight class.
Ryder, go put some ice on that.
I'll be in the kitchen in a minute.
I hope it leaves a scar.
Chicks dig scars.
Yeah, they do.
Hey, it's time to retire Battling Burke.
All right, all right, but before we do that-- a moment ago when she was shoving you, there wasn't something deep down inside where you just wanted to pop her back?
No, not pop her.
- Bitch slap her.
- See, that what I'm talking about.
Everybody's got an aggressive streak.
It's just how you channel it.
It's how you work it out.
Tell you what-- let's work a little of your aggression out right here, okay?
Gimme a good one.
Come on.
Nice nice nice nice.
Okay, now-- wait wait.
Try to pop me right here. ( Clicks tongue )
- I don't wanna.
- Come on, you can do it.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on.
Are you kidding me?
This is stupid.
I've got no more fight left.
- I give up.
- ( Chuckles ) Okay.
- ( Grunts ) - ( Laughs )
♪ Ha!
You got burked. ♪
So, flying solo today, uh?
Where's your uhm... sweet, psychotic friend?
She got back to the mother ship?
Hester has actually cleaned up her act.
She says hello to people at lunch, she smiles once in a while, she's even trying other nuts.
Wow, so you like berated her into being a better person.
I did. (laughs) Just like I said I would.
Oh Jeez, I know that look.
That's the look I get from your aunt all the time when she thinks she's been right all along.
And you don't like that look.
No... you know, kind of used to it.
Subtitles by DramaFever
Gyung Joon...
I feel strange.
The fact that you came...
Why do I like it so much?
What did you say?
I...
I'm going to go inside and get something.
You want something to drink?
Are you thirsty?
Do you want something to drink?
She just said she was so happy that I came...
But now she's lying...
Why am I being like this?
I must be crazy!
Did I...
Did I...
Ask you what you wanted?
What...do you want me to get you?
I...didn't say anything.
Water?
I'll get water...
Gil Da Ran...
Why is she being like that?
What?
Are you not enjoying the movie?
I don't know if it's because Choong Sik picked the movie, but there's a lot of blood, right?
Are you scared?
Yeah.
Teacher Gil...
Do you like me?
I thought you didn't hear it...
But I guess you did hear...
You really do have sharp ears...
So...
What I meant was...
I was wondering if I had to watch this scary movie all by myself, and I was thinking that it was such a relief and how happy I was that you showed up.
But why was your expression like that?
You looked like someone that got caught while confessing their feelings.
What do you mean, confession?
I guess you still haven't noticed even though you've been around me all this time.
Whenever I want to eat something or anything like that...
I get a blank look on my face like this.
I was thinking of something to drink because I was so thirsty...
That's what that was about...
Are you sure it was a drink that you were thirsting for at that moment?
Are you sure it wasn't for this guy?
The truth is...
I don't know if it's because I'm confused these days...
But I was happy when you came.
That's why I told you that I felt strange!
I promised you that I will never go there, and I'm abiding by that.
But if you come at me saying that you like me...
I don't have the confidence to refuse.
So don't be confused anymore.
And don't hang all over me.
-Hang all over?
-I'm hungry.
Let's go eat.
-I told you to quit it!
-I did it because I was happy to see you!
-Don't be like that and let's get a drink...
-Don't be all over me.
I don't want to!
I will buy you whatever you want!
Huh?
He's telling me I was like that?
Why do I like the fact that you came so much?
Jesus...!
I'm telling you that I like you...
[To hang all over] [Continuously smacking the lips out of desire]
[Da Ran was hanging all over Gyung Joon in front of the movie theater with an ear phone]
[Choong Sik is earnestly hanging all over Ma Ri using paying off the pizza as an excuse]
Did you come to see Kang Gyung Joon instead of going to see a movie?
If there's a movie that you don't really want to see...
And you're willing to go with a certain person to see it...
That means you like the other person, right?
At the very least...
It means that it's not a total zero.
Then how many points do you think that's worth?
If you had gone to see the movie with me...
I...
Would've thought that it was worth about 80 points.
80 points?
You think it would be that high?
If you like someone enough to say 80 points...
Then there are only 20 points left.
When Kang Gyung Joon is lying in bed like this...
Who are you being like this over?
Since I can't answer that, don't ask.
Jang Ma Ri...
Is there a new guy that she likes other than Kang Gyung Joon?
What does that mean?
My son is...
Yoon Jae only.
That child isn't my son...
He was only born to save my son, Yoon Jae!
I...
Don't know a kid named Kang Gyung Joon.
Kang Gyung Joon is her son...
But she just abandoned him?
Is that what that means?
[Yoon Jae's mother]
Yes...
I'm right in front of the hotel right now.
I'll see you soon.
Thanks for the tea...
I'll enjoy it.
But what is the favor that you have to ask of me?
The patient that you said my Yoon Jae's concerned about...
Do you mean Kang Gyung Joon?
Is he...
Making a recovery?
We've done every examination there is for us to do...
But we don't know the reason why he's not waking up.
If there are any changes...
Will you let me know?
I'm sure you can ask Yoon Jae directly...
But you're his doctor in charge.
Since it's a patient that has ties to my Yoon Jae...
So I'm just a little curious.
Will you call me once in awhile and let me know?
Oh yes...
I also have a gift for you.
Please wait for a moment.
By any chance...
Is that kid her son?
Did Seo Yoon Jae go around searching for someone in the past?
Yoon Jae?
Seo Yoon Jae's mom said that.
That he was going around searching for someone that she doesn't really like.
That it's a good thing the searching has stopped since he's changed.
Really?
I don't really know.
-Did she say that it was someone important?
-She won't tell me.
Seeing how she said that she would like for him to just ignore him even if they met...
By any chance...
Do you think it's a woman that used to hang all over Seo Yoon Jae?
Isn't the food really horrible here?
There's not a single thing for me hang myself all over on.
Yeah...
This place is horrible...
Is that why you brought me here?
Yeah.
I brought you here on purpose.
This is my uncle's restaurant.
The look of it is almost just like my mom's restaurant.
Really?
This place really looks cool.
Because my mom was cool.
Yeah.
When I saw her in the picture, she really seemed cool.
Oh my...
You came back for another meal.
Ah...
Thanks to the number that you gave me last time...
I was able to get in touch with Chef Sergei.
Thank you so very much.
Hello.
Ah...!
Teacher at Gyung Joon's school!
Aren't you?
It's really fascinating...
Teacher at Gyung Joon's school...
Gyung Joon's friend...
You bought Gyung Joon's house...
You even know the phone number to someone that only Gyung Joon knows...
To say that it's all just a coincidence doesn't make any sense...
Are you by any chance...!
Were you sent by Gyung Joon's dad?
Gyung Joon's dad...
Felt uncomfortable showing up in front of us himself...
So did he send you in his place?
Gyung Joon's father...
You know him?
So...
Just once when Gyung Joon was born...
All I did was to pass by him at the hospital.
Hee Soo called him 'Teacher'...
But even when I asked her who it was, she never told me.
Teacher?
I'm sure it was probably...
Someone who already had a family.
Hee Soo really wasn't that type of a girl...
Honey...
You should get up now so that the two guests can be comfortable.
-Why?
We're having a serious conversation...
-Get up...
Enjoy your meal.
It should be all good if he wasn't sent by Gyung Joon's dad.
But why are you sitting there telling him everything?
I was telling him the stuff because he was asking me about it!
They're really good people...
You have no eye for judging people...
You didn't know anything about your dad?
Mom never told me about him.
If he's still alive...
Don't you think you'll be able to find him?
Do you think he'll be glad to see me if I were to find him?
The Kang Gyung Joon that other people know is lying in the hospital right now.
Then...
Does this mean that this kid is Yoon Jae's younger brother?
-Jong Woo!
-Yeah?
You're close to Doctor Lee that's in charge of the DNA testing department, right?
-Yeah.
-I received an urgent request from someone...
Will I be able to get a paternity test result on these quickly?
A paternity test?
This is...a picture that your father drew?
That's what I was told.
Other than that, I don't have anything else.
Even if I wanted to find him, I have no way to find him.
Is he someone that draws pictures?
I don't know.
But...
I feel like I've seen this drawing somewhere before?
That?
I'm sure there's only one of it in the world...
You think he's going around all over the place drawing it for everyone?
No...
I've seen it somewhere before.
Where did I see it?
There's no way that you'd have seen it.
And I have no thoughts of searching for him.
Gyung Joon...
If you want to find your father...
Tell me at any time.
-If I can help, I'll help you.
-Uh Oh...
I'm driving right now.
The handle is shaking.
This wasn't...me pestering you!
Ah...
Then you're admitting that you were pestering me earlier?
I'm...sorry...!
Sorry...!
Please stop it...
We didn't even get to really see the movie...
And didn't even have a proper dinner...
It's your last night of vacation...
Is there anything you want to do?
Find something that was made in China.
I have to pass out honeymoon gifts at work.
Do you really have to gift something, that was made in China just because you supposedly went there?
Oh!
Made in China!
An Eiffel Tower isn't right when I went to China, right?
I wonder if there's Forbidden City Pandas or things like that?
These little teddy bears!
If you were to paint parts of it black, wouldn't it become pandas?
Wow...
I guess so.
If I painted the eyes, ears and the stomach black...?
The stomach is white.
It's the feet that are black.
Penguin is the one with a white stomach.
Pandas stomach is black.
You want to bet?
-Call!
-Race!
Don't look at mine.
How petty...
Over a panda...
Was it right to color their arms black?
-Just tell me about the arms.
-Okay, okay...
The arms are white.
-The arms are white?
-Yeah.
The arms are white.
-Don't peek...
-Oh!
The legs are black!
It's perfect.
Let...
Let me just see the tail.
-The tail.
-Did you color that or not?
I'm sure that more places would have it...
The winning person lives like a panda.
Eat, sleep.
Eat, sleep.
Not having to do anything.
I'll show you what the laziest panda in the world is like.
Why don't you show Gil Panda first?
Ta da...!
Teacher Gil...
A panda doesn't wear black panties.
Why don't you show Kang Panda?
This is...
A true panda!
First...
We need to confirm it.
Search panda.
Here are your results.
See?
Long arms, a short belly tee.
You can see the stomach, it has boots on and doesn't wear panties.
Kang Panda...
Wins!
Turning a polar bear into a panda...
After having worked so hard, my shoulders are aching.
Massage my shoulders.
What are you doing?
Winner Kang Panda wants you to give me a massage.
That's right, that's right...
Oh my...
That feels good...
Oh my...
That feels so good...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Getting a massage is making me thirsty.
Go bring me some water.
Yes...
Teacher Gil...
The panty wearing panda isn't bad either.
Here.
Staple it.
Hey...
Why don't you put some of these in there too?
Kang Panda doesn't work.
I can help you out about this much.
Here.
Put another one out.
Okay.
-Hurry up and pick up the pace.
-Here.
Ma Ri!
Why did you want to come to Da Ran and Yoon Jae's home on the way to school?
I'm going to come morning and night every single day.
Ma Ri...
My sister...is a newlywed.
Barging into a newlyweds home first thing in the morning...
That could cause a major disturbance!
I'm not eating it...
I told you I won't eat it.
Eat it while I'm still being nice.
They're fighting.
Do you like the fact that my sister and my brother-in-law are fighting that much?
Do you know how much good protein there are in beans?
Do you know how many different foods that are sources of protein?
There's no need to have to eat these hated beans!
Eat it...
I woke up early this morning to boil the beans separately to add to the rice!
I can't hear you!
I can't hear you...!
I won't eat it, not eating it!
Not eating it!
I have to leave quickly because mom asked to see me.
Make sure to eat all this!
He hates beans to death.
If she keeps making him do things he doesn't like it'll shave off some of those points, right?
You...even know about how my brother-in-law doesn't like beans?
He's...eating the beans.
I guess my brother-in-law listens well to my sister.
Ma Ri...
What's wrong?
If it's enough for him to eat the beans that he hates...
How many points do you think that's worth?
It's probably about... 90 points?
Ma Ri...
If it was for you...
I can even eat carrots, which I hate more than death.
If it's 90 points...
Then there are only 10 points left for me.
Jang Ma Ri...
You don't...
Our Doctor Seo?
Hi mom.
Why did you call me over?
You said your mother-in-law is returning to America soon, right?
Go take this to her.
Mother-in-law?
Ah...
Yoon Jae's mother?
How can you refer to her as Yoon Jae's mother when you're married to him?
She's your mother-in-law.
And you're her daughter-in-law.
I...
I guess so?
Yoon Jae is her one and only son.
You have to be good to her...
Okay?
Teacher...
90 points is a really high score, right?
Did you receive a 90 point score?
I bet if you worked a little harder, you'll score a hundred points.
What's wrong?
You wish for Gyung Joon to return quickly to his body too, right?
That is what needs to happen.
You don't like Gyung Joon being around, right?
You really want Seo Yoon Jae to come back quickly, right?
Even if by some chance...
Gyung Joon tells you that he likes you now,
You have to scold him.
Harsher than when you scolded him for not eating his beans.
You have to really scold him and tell him that he needs to return to himself.
Fighting!
Yeah...
It's right...that Gyung Joon goes back.
Teacher Gil Da Ran?
Thank you for the gift.
It wasn't much.
Now that you've gotten married...
Would you like to try an intellectual project?
Excuse me?
Teacher Lee Da Hae's magazine's decree corner...
I want you to submit a piece for it.
Kang Gyung Joon...
You're troubled about your father, aren't you?
Leaving something like this behind...
Don't you think it's because your father wants you to find him?
You know Jumong, right?
He also went in search of his father with the proof his father left behind for him.
Since he's a King...
If my father was a King, I would've gone to find him too.
Look at the drawing.
If he is someone that does drawings just like you said, do you think he's even making enough of a living to feed himself?
If he drew this as a hobby, his taste doesn't even match mine.
What's with the angels?
So you have no intentions of looking for him?
Well if he were to come find me, I will meet with him...
But I have no intentions of seeking him out first.
You've never once thought that you would like to see him?
There were times that I've been curious...
But I've never needed him.
Since I was living perfectly fine and happy alone with my mom.
Yoon Jae's mother is Kang Gyung Joon's birth mother.
Should I tell Yoon Jae about this?
It seems like Seo Yoon Jae was mainly raised alone by his mom too...
Is the relationship between his parents not very good?
I know that they don't live together.
Even while I was in America, I didn't see him once.
I think they just set the date once a year to meet and that's it.
0624.
You remember Seo Yoon Jae's secret pass code numbers, right?
Ah... 0624?
Ah, that's right...
I remember him saying that it was a family meeting.
But what did they say that day was?
A wedding anniversary?
When they only meet up once a year, you think they meet for a wedding anniversary?
I don't know either.
When you hear 0624...
Is there anything else you can think of?
Why?
Is there something else that's important?
Forget it.
I'm sure there's no way that you'd remember.
Why?
Is it important?
No...
Just don't make the rice with beans.
0624.
June 24th.
I told her pointedly that it was my birthday.
She totally has an awful brain.
How can she not remember that?
I have no clue how she became a teacher with a head like that.
0624?
What could it be?
Does he mean that he doesn't want me to make rice with beans on that day?
I feel like he said something when he told me that it was Yoon Jae's pass code... 0624...
Ah!
That's right!
Gyung Joon!
Why?
Did you remember?
Yeah.
I remembered something I have to get done by June 24th.
What is it?
I was told to write a decree by June 24th.
Decree?
Is Yoon Jae's book over here?
You took all of Seo Yoon Jae's stuff.
Did you leave something behind?
I found it!
What is that?
It's a writing that Yoon Jae contributed for the teenagers.
I'm going to reference it.
Reference?
Assistant Principle wants me to write about why I wanted to become a teacher.
And Yoon Jae's writing was about why he wanted to become a doctor.
So you're saying you're going to steal it.
I'm saying I'm going to reference it.
Reference.
'I met myself at age 18'
The title is really boring and has no originality.
It's about how he can look back to what he was like when he was about your age.
It's a very warm piece of writing.
Is the book a hot pack or something?
Warm, my butt...
The age when I first decided to become a doctor was when I was 18.
Because it was then that I realized that my life was continuing on because someone reached out their warm hand to me.
Thus I wanted to become someone that could reach out a warm hand to other kids.
If I poured out my sincere heart into that hand...
The salvation that I received...
I believed could continue to pay forward.
I always ask my 18-year old self.
Whether if I'm doing a good job right now...
Whether my hand...is warm...
I guess you just need to change the word doctor in here to teacher.
Right?
That's why I thought of this too.
So it is true that you're stealing it.
I wanted to become a teacher when I was 18 years old too.
What does my student Kang Gyung Joon want to become?
What do you think...
That I would be good to become?
You're asking me?
Seo Yoon Jae said that he had a realization through grabbing out to someone else's hand.
So give me a realization.
Just because I tell you to become something, you think you'll be able to become it?
I can!
I can become anything...
So give it some thought.
What Kang Gyung Joon's future will be like.
I'll think about it.
What you'll be like in the future.
While you're thinking about it...
Think about the near future too.
June 24th.
What is it that he keeps acting like that for?
Gyung Joon's birthday!
He's getting another year older.
Kang Gyung Joon's future.
Did I see Gyung Joon being born?
Yes.
Are you sure that Kang Gyung Joon's deceased mother is his birth mother?
I was wondering...
If maybe he was adopted.
I did see her pregnant with my own eyes.
And my husband was the one that reported his birth on June 24th too.
Why are you asking me these things?
Is there a problem?
No...
I'm just confirming the patient's family relations.
If the test results are correct...
Yoon Jae's mom is that kid's mom...
But the birth mother is different?
Was it a surrogacy?
She hasn't recognized you today either?
Endure it.
If you pretend to notice her first, then you lose.
Then...
I'm sure the fact that I had a crush on her would become noticeable?
Even in the past...
I was able to maintain my dignity from not making anything obvious.
I...
Cried.
You foolish man...
By any chance...
Have you ever heard of Antagap?
(The word in Korean also means unfortunate)
Antagap?
Even though Sejong himself loved her...
He ultimately couldn't keep her by his side, and her name was Antagap.
The hollowed out feeling he felt in his heart is where our word, "unfortunate" originated from.
President Kang...
You're very insightful.
After sending my Jung Hye...
To that old teacher...
Even inside my heart...
Antagap had continued to stay there.
Antagap?
When this cell phone first came out...
I cried.
Antagap that was living quietly inside my heart...
Had shot open its eyes.
The day that I had my first date with Jung Hye...
When I was running to her because I was late...
If only I had a cell phone like today...
If I could've just made one phone call to tell her that I'm running late...
I'm sure Jung Hye would've waited for me.
Jung Hye...!
How unfortunate...
Now that I've been listening to you...
Antagap that's been living inside of me...
Is shooting its eyes wide open.
When I first saw those navigation systems...
I pounded on my chest.
On my way out to meet Senior Gil...
If I only had a navigation system like there are these days...
I'm sure I would've found my way correctly.
How unfortunate...
It is so unfortunate.
Even if Jung Hye would only recognize me first...
I think the Antagap that's in my heart will change quite a bit...
Why doesn't she recognize me?
Love is cruel.
Always...
The person that likes the other more...
Is the unfortunate one...
And the one that hurts.
What would be a good birthday for kids these days?
Who?
Is it Choong Sik's birthday?
It's someone much smarter than him...
So I'm wondering about what to get him.
Hey...
Are you picking out a gift for your lover or something?
What are you wondering about it for?
Just buy him whatever.
It can't be whatever.
Something to pour all my expectation for him to grow up into an amazing person in the future, and give him a realization of some sorts?
What do you think that can be?
Wow...
That's tremendous.
A gift that a dream about your future can be poured into?
That's hard.
Hey...
I'm going to get going.
I'll talk to you later.
Vice Principle...!
What could it be?
A book?
Teacher!
I heard that Gyung Joon went to his uncle's restaurant and talked about his dad?
Yeah...
But I don't think Gyung Joon has any intentions to search for him.
He has to find him.
He's with you because you're the only adult that he has to stay by his side.
If his dad were to show up...
You don't have to be around.
And that would be good for you too.
I guess so?
I'm fine right now.
I don't dislike being by Gyung Joon's side.
Can you always be there by his side?
You know that you can't.
If he were to find his dad...
Even when Gyung Joon were to go back to his original self he won't be alone, so you don't need to worry.
Even if it's for the future...
I'm going to make sure to find Gyung Joon's dad.
Gyung Joon...
You have to find your dad!
I said, you have to find your dad!
What's the point of finding him?
He's someone that I've never even seen or known about in my entire life.
We can find him first, and you can see what kind of a person he is.
With your looks right now, you can look for him without making it obvious.
It's a totally perfect disguise.
Will finding him...be of any help?
It'll be of help to Teacher Gil Da Ran.
The burden that she feels about looking after you...
You can find your dad and hand it over to him.
What would Teacher Gil feel burdened by?
If you think about it, the one that's living as a freeloader is Teacher Gil.
Anyways...
That's what she thinks.
Even though she's not saying anything because she's a little flighty and a good person...
I'm sure she's feeling really, really burdened.
Does she feel burdened?
Was it not right for me to say that I wouldn't be doing anything like the pandas?
Let's do it together.
It's just that she's not saying anything...
But I'm sure she's feeling really burdened and hating me.
Okay...
While not being able to always stay by his side...
Getting involved in his future is...
To be hanging all over him.
I have to step aside.
Okay...
Let's not think about Gyung Joon's future...
And let's think of mine with Yoon Jae.
What did we do for Yoon Jae's birthday last year?
What did we do?
The bicycle, the bicycle...
We were supposed to meet up and ride the bicycle together on his birthday.
Because Yoon Jae was late, I was waiting with the bicycle...
But because Yoon Jae couldn't come even though I waited for over 2 hours...
I just had to return it.
Okay...
I was a woman that knew how to wait for 2 hours even in that cold...
Okay...!
Let's not forget, Gil Da Ran.
Rah, rah!
Rah, rah!
Her shouting cries are really burdensome.
Burden?
Is she feeling burdened?
When it's Yoon Jae's face...
Why do I only see it as Gyung Joon?
This house...
is nice because it's so big, but it's a bit of a burden to clean.
Burden?
Here...
Step aside.
This is nothing...
I'll do it, I'll do it.
You were going to laze around like a panda today...
No...
Kang panda will work today, so Gil panda can laze around.
Lay down there and get some rest.
Really?
This is a breeze!
If I do it, it'll be finished quickly.
I saw that the grass has gotten longer too.
Are you feeling burdened because the grass has grown tall?
I'll cut the lawn.
I'll shave it all off as if it's being sent off to the army.
Really?
Then I'll get the dinner ready.
I'll go grocery shopping.
No!
I'll do the shopping.
I will.
Um...
Teacher Gil...
I lived well on my own too.
I can do fine by myself even if you don't worry about it so much.
Why don't you go in and get some rest?
I'll go grocery shopping.
Don't feel burdened.
I guess Gyung Joon...
Will be fine without me.
Gil Da Ran...
Stop thinking about Gyung Joon.
What's important to you right now is...
Is the past with Yoon Jae.
Teacher Gil...
Are you going somewhere?
Yeah...
It's stifling to just sit around...
So I'm going to try to get myself to turn back a little.
By yourself?
You want me to come with you?
No...
You don't have to come.
I'm...going to find Gil Da Ran, who once used to know how to wait.
Okay...
I'll have all the cleaning, laundry, and the cooking done.
Don't feel burdened by anything...
And go find whatever it is that you need to find.
Where is the bench that I was waiting at before?
It's so confusing because they all look exactly alike.
Seriously...
I'm so good at whatever I do.
But is it way too clean?
Teacher Gil needs to see things like this so that she doesn't find it burdensome to live with me...
-Gyung Joon!
-Hey!
Don't you walk in here so rashly!
Do you know how hard I worked to get this floor clean?
Gyung Joon...
I've brought you some information concerning your dad.
Doctor Seo...
Do you want me to stop by Madame's hotel?
No...
I need to go to Professor Park Min Gyu first.
There was a certain painter's exhibit that my dad and your mom went to New York to see.
It's this person.
Really?
You said your mom called your dad a teacher, right?
This man...
Is a professor at the art school your mom went to.
Isn't it perfect?
Park Min Gyu...
You really came.
-It's been a long time.
-Come on in.
Last year...
Your son Seo Yoon Jae came to see me.
But this time...
It's you?
My Yoon Jae...came to see you?
He came to ask about Hee Soo and her son.
So...
Have you....
Found her son?
I haven't found him yet.
Forget it.
Gyung Joon...
Even if it's for you future, you have to find your dad.
The one that I want by my side in my future...
Isn't my dad.
Then who is it?
Even though I can become anything if someone wants it of me...
The other people cannot become what I want of them.
So...
It doesn't matter if I'm alone.
Me...
Include me.
Since I got the whole place cleaned up, don't make a mess and just leave.
I have to show her the place just the way it looks right now.
After digging up all the information...
My head is hurting.
-I think I need to lie down and rest.
-Hey...
Jang Ma Ri!
Don't you dare even think about sticking yourself in there!
One...by one...
My things...
If I use it as if it were my room...
Then it becomes my room.
Where is it?
Is this one...not right?
I'm sure it is.
I'm sure somewhere around here...
Even though it was cold, I waited in excitement.
Try to remember.
Where is it?
While waiting...
For the person I like to show up...
Try to get the heart to start pounding again.
Why isn't it like before?
What?
Where are you?
I told you I had something to do at the park.
I'm at the park too.
Whereabouts are you?
What?
You are?
Why did you come here?
I came to look for you.
Where are you?
Oh, where am I?
I'm in front of the big awning.
Okay.
I'll find you.
Why did he come?
How is he saying that he's going to find me?
My heart is...
Pounding...
Just like the time that I was waiting for someone I like...
Why am I like this?
When the one I'm waiting for...
is Gyung Joon...
I must be crazy...
Where are you?
I'm not here anymore.
What?
You left?
I told you to wait.
The one I'm supposed to wait for...
Isn't you.
So don't look for me.
I can't...see you right now.
Okay.
I won't see you.
I'll go.
Gyung Joon...
You have to go.
I'm in the process of waiting right now.
You have to go.
The 2 children in this picture...
Are they both your sons?
If one of them is Yoon Jae, then the other is...
The child that Hee Soo gave birth to?
He moved again!
-This time, I saw it!
-Really?
Hurry!
Hurry!
Gyung Joon!
Gyung Joon...!
Gyung Joon!
Gyung Joon!
Gyung Joon!
Kang Gyung Joon!
I found it...
I finally found it...
But why is it different than before?
Hi Ma Ri.
Teacher...
Gyung Joon's body at the hospital moved again.
Are you with him?
Is Gyung Joon okay?
By any chance...
Did they switch back?
I...
I...
I'm going.
I'll go right now.
Then...
Has Gyung Joon gone?
Gyung Joon!
Gyung Joon!
Gyung Joon...
Kang Gyung Joon!
Teacher Gil...
It's me.
I...
Think I went to my body again.
I'm sorry...
For not coming back as Seo Yoon Jae.
So this time isn't it either.
It's the same here too.
How are you?
It hurt.
I felt dizzy and nauseous...
And it hurt unbelievably badly.
If we're going to switch back, we should've switched back for good...
Why did it just hurt?
What about Gil Da Ran?
I think she was really disappointed.
She didn't even say anything, and went into her room.
I must have gone crazy...
I must have gone crazy...
Seo Yoon Jae...
Hurry up and come back.
Da Ran said she can't make it into work because she's sick today.
After playing to her heart's content at her honeymoon...
Now she's playing again from being sick.
Is she really sick?
I don't know...
You're not someone who doesn't concern yourself with others being sick.
Ah yes...
You're my blind date for tonight?
(Other line is a solicitor's call)
Yes...
Really?
Yes...
I eat anything well...
That's fine with me.
I'm going to report you to the police!
Stop calling me!
Are you really sick?
Let's go to the hospital.
I don't need to go to the hospital.
I'm the one who was hurting from having to go back and forth...
So why are you sick?
Were you that disappointed?
It's because I'm disappointed at myself.
This time...
It was about 30 seconds longer.
At this rate...
I'm sure he'll come back permanently.
Don't be disappointed.
Gyung Joon...
When...you go back to yourself for good...
Will I...
Will I be able to just send you away?
Am I...
That terribly burdensome?
Don't think about things like that...
And just don't be sick.
I'll go get you some medicine.
You asked me to let you know if there was a change to Gyung Joon's condition?
Did something happen?
You seem to be really worried.
Would you like to go see for yourself?
I don't...want to see him.
Why?
That child...
Isn't he your son?
The kid that Yoon Jae was searching for...
Is Gyung Joon, right?
He was searching for him because he's his own brother, right?
When Yoon Jae was 12 years old...
He got really sick.
In order to save Yoon Jae...
We needed a brother for Yoon Jae.
However...
My body wasn't able to have a child.
So...
My husband...and the woman he loved...
Had a baby together.
That child...
Is Gyung Joon.
Gyung Joon was born to save my Yoon Jae.
That child...
I can't say that he's my own.
In order to save a child...
Another child descends down, and grabs his band...
When the accident happened, Yoon Jae is the one that saved Kang Gyung Joon.
A fate where they save each other...
They met...
While not even knowing who the other is.
Don't you think...you should tell him?
Don't get involved.
I don't want those two...
To ever get involved.
Have you never...planned on seeing him?
The truth is...
Unless my Yoon Jae ever gets sick again...
I believed that I will never again have any reasons to see that child.
Is the story about salvation?
In salvation...
You need love and sacrifice.
So he was only needed to save Yoon Jae.
If he never wakes up again like this...
And disappears...
What then?
Why are you out here?
I'm okay now.
Are you okay now?
I'm okay now...
But if I were to go back...
I'm sure it'll hurt more, right?
Going back to our own original place...
I think is going to be a very painful thing.
Teacher Gil...
If it's too hard and burdensome...
Don't worry about me.
I'll endure it well on my own...
And when I go back...
I'll disappear from your side.
So that you'll never have to see me again...
I'll just disappear.

Ahh.
Throat looks good.
Pupils are dilating normally.
Do you want to sit up?
Any fever?
- She's cool to the touch.
- No.
Although I couldn't get her to submit to a core reading.
Uh, appetite?
Diminished.
Greatly diminished.
How's the mood?
Good?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
She's moody, but then she always has been.
Regular bowel movements, from what I can hear, but a mother's instinct, Dr. Roger.
Something's different.
She's off.
Mrs. shay, may I ask you to step into the waiting room for a moment?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's none of your business.
Being in love is nothing to be ashamed of.
Unless he's a drifter.
Are you in love with a drifter?
No.
It's not Arthur Fonzarelli, is it?
Because he's fictional.
Look, Lisa, I get it.
You're a tweenager, and tweenagers don't like talking to their parents.
I'm not a tweenager.
I'm practically old enough to vote.
Now you listen to me, Lisa Marie.
For years, I have sat here while you prattled on about your social life, when nothing even remotely interesting was going on!
Well, now that things are getting real,
I want details.
I want the dish.
Bring it on, sistah.
She broke your bed?
Buddy, Jill was doing things to me last night that would have broken a K.G.B. Agent.
She's got me open, buddy, wide open.
My theory is that she had been so repressed, so frigid for so many years that her sexual energy pent up inside of her like a Tsunami, and once I figured out how to unleash her waves, they have been crashing down on me every night, buddy!
Every night I have been surf in' my lady's brine.
Okay, I'm just gonna take this to go.
Oh, hell, I'll eat it.
Thank you.
I'm ravenous from all the intercourse.
I can't get enough sustenance to fuel the intercourse.
Mm.
Dallas!
Oh!
George, you startled me.
I was mid-tweet.
"#mid-tweet"... and send.
I'm all yours.
Well, I-I haven't seen you around recently.
- Everything good?
- So, so good!
If you read my last tweet, then you wouldn't have to ask.
Well, I'd rather ask.
When I don't see you, I worry about you, Dallas.
I mean, I think about you, and I know this must be kind of a rough time.
Rough time?
You know, with the divorce.
I heard it was finalized.
Why, yes, it was.
I got the papers this morning, and I had 'em laminated.
My divorce is so final, you could eat off it, which I did, and it tasted good.
Glad to hear you're eating well and keeping yourself...
Real, real busy.
I've been filling every second of every day with lots of real fun, super fun, real fun stuff.
Okay.
And then, come midnight,
I stone-cold medicate myself, and I sleep like a rock.
Oh.
Well, okay.
It sounds like you have a system, I guess, but, you know, things do have a way of catching up with you.
I know, which is why I have dalia in therapy five days a week.
Well, gotta run.
I have a pap smear, and then I'm taking Yakult to get blinged-out grillz like Nelly.

Come in.
Hey.
Hey.
Tessa, let me just cut to the chase.
The story is about to break, and I want you to hear it from me first.
I have taken Malik...
As a lover.
I knew that.
Did my mother tell you?
I knew I couldn't trust her.
What?
No.
Lisa...
I could tell.
I saw you two the other day at the water fountain.

Where did you learn how to drink from a fountain, girl?
Pretty obvious.
I just...
I want you to know that although he and I will most likely be exploring parts of each other's bodies that are difficult to clean, my relationship with you will remain stet.
- "Stet"?
- Unchanged.
I won't abandon you, Tessa.
I didn't think you would.
'Cause I'm not the kind of girl that ditches her G.F. The minute she gets a B.F., you know, 'cause me and you...
We're for real.
We're like Thelma and that other ho.
Lisa, relax.
I'm happy for you and Malik, and the thought that you might ditch me, honestly, never even crossed my mind.
I'd take a bullet for you.
Thanks.
I was happy for Lisa and Malik.
Really, I was, but if I recalled correctly,
Thelma and Louise's relationship ended on kind of a down note.
How about "Lisik"?
Mm... it's okay.
I don't think it beats "Malisa."
Tessa, what do you think?
I think you two should maintain your individual identities and not feel compelled to fuse into one person just because you're dating.
Tessa, every couple has a couple name.
I wasn't going to argue with her.
Everything would be fine as long as she didn't ask Malik to...
Oh, Malik.
You've gotta taste my vanilla.

Bye, mommy.
Carmen's taking me to therapy.
Oh.
Hey!
Wait.
Carmen, what are you up to afterwards?
I go to see my Uncle.
Oh, super fun!
Mind if I come with?
He's in hospice.
Carmen!
See you later, mommy.
Okay then.
Okay.
I'll see you later, dalia and Carmen.
I'll see you both later then.
Thanks so much for having me over for breakfast.
Oh.
I think he has an Obama quality.
I see a young Obama...
Meets Denzel...
Meets Sammy Davis Jr...
You're just naming black people.
Meets Montell Jordan.
I actually get that a lot.
You're jiving me.
Really?
Mom.
Tessa.
She wants to know what's up for the weekend.
- Well, tell her you're hanging out with me.
- I'm afraid that if I do that, she'll spend the whole weekend hiding out in the handicapped stall of the girls' room.
- Mm.
- We need to find someone to hook Tessa up with, so she doesn't feel like a third wheel.
Would you like to sleep over tonight?
I-I don't think my mom would allow that.
Of course not.
I just don't want him to lose interest.
I won't.
What about Evan?
We already know that he likes Tessa, and he won't have any conflicting plans because he's friendless.
It's a win-win.
Okay, you lovebirds.
Time for school.
Hip-hop or you're gonna be late.
You two have a great day.
Ham and cheese, brother.
If you keep dating Lisa, plenty more where that came from.
Why is she coming bed shopping with us?
Why am I coming bed shopping with you?
Because I want your opinion.
Well, I want Dallas to think we want her opinion.
I'm worried about her.
She seemed a little manic the last time I talked to her.
Hi, y'all!
Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
Ohh.
I hope I'm dressed okay.
Since I didn't know what we were doing,
I brought a raincoat, a walking coat, a car coat, and a cape, in case we see opera.
We probably won't see opera.
Yeah, probably no opera.
We're going shopping for a bed.
Oh!
Super fun.
Hey, can your car find us...
A European mattress store?
Prius!
Mattress store!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, what about that place on post road?
Let's do it.
Evan.
Look, if you're here to pants me, don't waste your time.
I'm wearing a belt made of staples that go into my skin.
I'm not here to pants you.
I'm here to talk to you about Tessa.
What about Tessa?
Look, I know you like her, and I want to help you so that she likes you back.
Are you the great Houdini?
Because if not, Malik,
I seriously doubt that she would...
Look, Evan, I'm black, and black people know a lot about romance.
Is that true?
Al green, Al B. Sure!
Huh?
Jodeci, oran "juice" Jones, Teddy Riley,
Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin gaye?
Yeah, but wasn't he...
No.
Evan, he wasn't.
Okay.
Maybe black people are smoove.
So what do I have to do to make Tessa like me?
A lot of things, Evan, and none of those things include wearing a belt made of staples that go into your skin.
It's like she expects people to feel sorry for her, but, like, I don't feel sorry for her.
What do you feel?
Angerment.
Bitterness.
Resent.
You blame her for the divorce.
I do.
I totally do.
You know, until you put those words into my mouth,
I didn't even realize I felt them.
Dalia, I think it's important that you confront her with these feelings.
Now if it's okay with you,
I'd like to bring her in.
You have a lot of nerve showing your face here!
Yakult!
This session is not about you.
It's about dalia.
Now you sit...
And you listen.
I don't want to see no panties tonight.
- What?
-
-What?
Take off that brassiere, my dear.
Evan, did you just tell me to take off my brassiere?
What?
N-no!
Wait.
Did you want me to tell you to do that?
Wait!
But, girl, I be tryin' to get witchu!
Evan, gross.
You just spit in my ear.
Really, you guys?
You're trying to unload me on Evan?
Tessa, we just didn't want you to feel like a third wheel.
I didn't!
Uh, no, but the other day at the yogurt shop...
You were being gross.
And we're gonna continue to be gross, really gross.
We just don't want this to affect our friendship.
This affects our friendship, okay?
If I wanted a man, I could have one.
I could have more than one.
Hey, I'm open to that, you little freak.
I don't need you trying to pawn me off on some perv.
That's the furthest
I ever went with a girl, you guys.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
That seems... good.
It's also comfortable for sleeping.
Yeah, I'm not gonna be doing a whole lot of sleeping on this baby.
Am I right?
It's the Rolls-Royce of mattresses, sir.
Uh, the... it's the last one we have in stock.
Hand-tailored Icelandic eiderdown, cashmere-encased coils, hypoallergenic horsehair batting.
The boning, of course, is unbleached pine.
"The boning."
I like the sound of that.
You seem very comfortable in it, sir, a-and I can assure you, there is not a finer mattress to be had.
I'll take it.
Excellent.
All right.
All right.
Ohh.
I know what you're thinking, and I totally agree.
- It is obscene...
- To spend that amount of money on a mattress.
"The honeymoon never has to end with the eternal honeymoon sleep system."
Dallas, are you okay?
Maybe Steven and I just had the wrong mattress.
Oh, honey.
No.
It wasn't that.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Hi.
Should I put down a waterproof pad?
Because I am just about to run your friend's card.
I really don't think that's necessary.
Okay.
You know what?
Get the pad.
End of a long school week, and you know what?
I was glad to have the night to myself.
I was no third wheel.
I was a unicycle.
You are a unicycle.
You're a unicycle.
I'd start with a light dinner, watch a thought-provoking documentary...
Move...
That...
Bus!
Oh, my gosh!
Reconnect with some old friends...
Cool and cute.
And help myself to a little bedtime snack.
Ryan?
What are you doing out there, watching me?
Yes.
Why?
Tessa, look at you.
You fell off.
You're wearing pajamas that are covered in food.
These are fresh out of the wash.
Look at all that butter.
Who would eat that much butter?
I can't...
Answer that question.
When I overheard my sister and Malik talking about trying to fix you up with someone, I thought,
Tessa Altman made out with Ryan shay.
She could have anyone, but after watching you from the bushes tonight,
I'm not so sure.
Ryan, wait.
I'm just...
Not myself right now, and, yes, maybe I am leaning on butter a little more than I normally would, but...
I'm a recovering tricycle, trying to get by on one wheel.
Been there.
So you wanna get something to eat?
Your pajamas are making me hungry.
So we close soon.
George, get her off my bed.
She's funkin' it up.
What do you want me to do?
Fix it!
You're the one who brought her with us.
Uh...
Oh, look.
It's dalia.
Dallas, it's your daughter dalia.
No?
Hello?
Hey, dalia.
Okay.
Okay.
You're... you're ready to be picked up?
Okay, great.
We're just running a few minutes late, so sit tight.
Dallas, dalia's ready to be picked up.
Are you gonna go get her?
I have a dinner engagement.
Okay.
Noah, take my car keys.
Go pick up dalia from her shrink.
Kill some time before you bring her home.
I will figure out a way to get Dallas out of this bed.
That's a promise, okay?
If Jill smells sorrow on this mattress...
We have a no-return policy.
Then you're buying it off of me.
Lock up when you leave.
If anything goes missing, it's going on your friend's card.
Uh, okay.
Thank you for your understanding.
Hey, okay, big sale today, though, right?
Right.
Why didn't mommy come get me herself?
Mommy...
Mommy is having a hard time right now.
She's going through some things.
Oh, please.
What's her problem?
She didn't want to live with daddy any more, but I did.
I guess that's true, isn't it?
Here, yakult.
You can have half of my spring roll.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that, Uncle Noah?
She almost bit me!
She almost bit me because I said something bad about mommy.
The two of them are total cohorts, if that's a word.
Oh, and now look.
She's eating the whole spring roll, when I only said she could have half.
Here.
You can have mine.
This is why I wanted my own pet.
This is why I asked mommy to please get me
"the hangover" monkey, like from that movie "the hangover."
I mean, she has yakult on her side, and I have no one.
I'm all alone.
Hey, have you seen that movie "kangaroo Jack"?
No.
Is it good?
I laid around a lot.
I watched a lot of "people's court,"
a court in which justice was almost never served, but then I realized, when you're a single parent, being depressed is a luxury you just can't afford.
You have to get up and take care of your kid, 'cause no one else is gonna do it for you.
I have Carmen.
Yes, you have Carmen to cook and to clean and to drive dalia the places she needs to go, but Carmen can't inspire dalia.
She can't teach her what it means to get up when you feel down.
Carmen isn't dalia's mother.
You are, and that right there is reason enough to climb off this outrageously comfortable mattress, this mattress that is clearly from heaven.
George, am I okay?
Of course you're okay.
I've never been...
Depressed.
It's standard issue.
Comes free with the divorce.
I don't even know what a depressed person dresses like.
Separates?
I'm probably gonna need a whole new depression wardrobe.
I'll probably need a whole new wardrobe.
♪ yeah ♪
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ And I just can't get enough ♪
Damn, girl.
Where did you learn how to eat fondue?
♪ Yeah ♪
Uh, let's just go somewhere else.
Why?
I thought you sid you wanted a bowl of wet, hot cheese.
I don't remember saying I w...
Okay, it was me.
I want a bowl of wet, hot cheese, and this place has it.
Plus wait till you see how long their forks are.
Okay.
Yeah!
Well, let's just get in there before they see us.
Are you sure you're okay with this?
'Cause I know they don't serve any of the food that was listed on your pajamas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't only eat... food that's on my pajamas.
Okay.
Whew.
'Cause I feel like
I may have oversold the forks a little.
No, they're big.
Yeah.
Aah.
Oh, my God, Malik.
Aah!
Ow!
Damn, girl!
Where did you learn how to feed someone fondue?
Do you see this?
My heart is breaking.
Tessa's bottomed out.
I'm bleeding.
You stabbed me in the gums.
Tessa, wait.
Don't run.
I'm not running.
I'm seated.
I can't even imagine how lost you must feel to resort to Ryan.
I...
Lisa, I'm fine.
You have to stop pitying me.
For a minute there, you had me pitying myself.
It's true.
I caught her eating butter.
Now that I think about it, it's kinda messed up that I brought you out for cheese.
You're gonna have wicked gas tonight.
Probably.
Listen, Lisa, you don't have to feel guilty about doing things without me.
I'm a big girl, okay, so go finish your fondue, and we'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Well, you heard that.
She's fine, so you can head on home.
Actually...
We're kinda having a nice time.
Really?
Really?
Yeah.
I didn't even own one pair of shoes when I walked barefoot into this country.
- Ew.
- Within a year,
I taught myself to speak English...
Carmen, honey, put a pin in it.
Dalia's mama's here to inspire her.
To speak English by listening to NPR 's "all things considered."
Dalia, I know you're mad at me.
I'm mad at me, too, and I'm mad at Steven, and I'm mad at Carmen.
- You're mad at me?
- It isn't always rational.
Now I know it's hard for you to understand the choices I've made, but I'm trying to show you that if you're unhappy in life, it's your responsibility to fix it.
No one else is gonna fix it for you.
I know, and that's why I made Uncle Noah buy me a "kangaroo Jack."
Dalia!
I'm pretty sure I was clear about no movie pets.
That said, he is a cute Carmel color.
That I was not expecting.
And he makes me really happy, mommy.
He does, and I can keep my cell phone in his pocket.
Then, Carmen, we have a new member of the family.
Thank you so much, mommy.
He is way cooler than "the hangover" monkey.
Aah!
So... this was fun.
Thank you for getting me out of the house tonight.
My mom says when you want to thank someone, you should send a thank-you card, but...
I don't want a thank-you card.
I want you to let me touch your boob instead.
My boob?
Either boob, just so I can say I did, mostly.
You have three seconds.
Go for it.
♪ If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods ♪
♪ Ah-ah-oh-oh-ah-oh ♪
So what's your address?
♪ Ah-ah-ah-oh-oh ♪
You don't have to send a thank-you card. bye.
♪ if you'd ever been out walking you would know ♪
Ah.
Throat looks good.
Pupils are dilating normally.
You wanna sit up?
Any fever?
- She's cool to the touch.
- No.
Although I couldn't get her to submit to a core reading, heh.
- Appetite?
- Diminished.
Greatly diminished.
Is the mood good?
Oh, heh.
I wouldn't say that.
She's moody.
But, then, she always has been.
Regular bowel movements, from what I can hear.
But a mother's instinct, Dr. Roger.
Something's different.
She's off.
Mrs. Shay, may I ask you to step into the waiting room for a moment?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because it's none of your business.
Being in love is nothing to be ashamed of.
Unless he's a drifter.
Are you in love with a drifter?
- No.
- It's not Arthur Fonzarelli, is it?
Because he's fictional.
Look, Lisa, I get it.
You're a tweenager.
And tweenagers don't like talking to their parents.
I'm not a "tweenager." I'm practically old enough to vote.
Now, you listen to me, Lisa Marie.
For years I have sat while you prattled on about your social life when nothing even remotely interesting was going on.
Well, now that things are getting real, I want details.
I want the dish.
Bring it on, sister.
She broke your bed?
Buddy, Jill was doing things to me last night that would have broken a KGB agent.
She's got me open, buddy.
Wide open.
My theory is that she had been so repressed so frigid, for so many years that her sexual energy pent up inside of her like a tsunami and once I figured out how to unleash her waves they have been crashing down on me every night, buddy.
Every night I have been surfing my lady's brine.
Okay, I'm gonna take this to go.
- Oh, hell, I'll eat it.
Thank you.
I'm ravenous from all the intercourse.
I can't get enough sustenance to fuel the intercourse.
- Dallas.
- Oh, George, you startled me.
I was mid-Tweet.
Hashtag, mid-Tweet.
And send.
I'm all yours.
I haven't seen you around recently.
- Everything good?
- So, so good.
If you read my Tweet, you wouldn't have to ask.
Ha, ha.
Well, I'd rather ask.
When I don't see you, I worry about you, Dallas.
I mean, I think about you.
I know this must be kind of a rough time.
- Rough time?
- You know.
With the divorce.
- I heard it was finalized.
- Why, yes, it was.
Got the papers this morning.
Had them laminated.
My divorce is so final, you could eat off it.
Which I did.
It tasted good.
Glad to hear you're eating well and keeping yourself...
Real busy.
I've been filling every second of every day with lots of real fun, super fun, real fun stuff.
- Ha, ha.
Okay.
- And then come midnight I stone-cold medicate myself, and I sleep like a rock.
Oh, well, okay.
Sounds like you have a system, I guess.
But things have a way of catching up with you.
I know.
Which is why I have Dalia in therapy five days a week.
Well, gotta run.
I have a pap smear and then I'm taking Yakult to get blinged-out grills like Nelly.
- Who is it?
- Lisa Shay.
Come in.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Tessa, let me just cut to the chase.
The story's about to break, and I want you to hear it from me first.
I have taken Malik.
As a lover.
- I knew that.
- Did my mother tell you?
- I knew I couldn't trust her.
- What, no?
Lisa, heh, I could tell.
I saw you two the other day.
At the water fountain.
Where'd you learn how to drink from a fountain, girl?
- Pretty obvious.
- I just...
I want you to know that although he and I will be exploring parts of each other's bodies that are difficult to clean my relationship with you will remain stet.
- Stet?
- Unchanged.
- I won't abandon you, Tessa.
- I didn't think you would.
I'm not the girl that ditches her GF the minute she gets a BF.
You know, because we're for real.
We're like Thelma and that other ho.
Lisa, relax.
I'm happy for you and Malik.
And the thought that you might ditch me honestly never even crossed my mind.
I'd take a bullet for you.
Thanks.
I was happy for Lisa and Malik.
Really, I was.
But if I recalled correctly Thelma and Louise's relationship ended on a down note.
- How about Lisik?
- Hmm.
It's okay.
I don't think it beats Malisa.
Tessa, what do you think?
I think you should maintain your identities and not feel compelled to fuse into one person because you're dating.
- Tessa, every couple has a couple name.
- I wasn't gonna argue with her.
Everything would be fine as long as she didn't ask Malik to...
Oh, Malik.
You gotta taste my vanilla.
Yeah.
Now I want you to taste mine.
Taste it.
Taste it all.
I should probably just go.
Well, I said it was for a dog when I booked the appointment.
Whose fault is that?
That's not my fault.
You can't cancel on me.
I cleared my whole evening.
Bye, Mommy.
Carmen's taking me to therapy.
Oh, hey, wait, Carmen, what are you up to afterwards?
I go to see my uncle.
- Oh, super fun.
Mind if I come with?
- He's in hospice.
- Carmen.
- Oh.
See you later, Mommy.
Okay, then.
Okay.
I'll see you later, Dalia and Carmen.
I'll see you both later, then.
Thanks so much for having me over for breakfast.
I think he has an Obama quality.
I see a young Obama.
- Meets Denzel.
Ha, ha.
Meets Sammy Davis Jr
- You're just naming black people.
- Meets Montell Jordan.
Ha, ha.
- I get that a lot.
- Oh, you're jiving me.
Really?
- Mom.
Tessa.
She wants to know what's up for the weekend.
- Tell her you're hanging out with me.
- She'll spend the weekend hiding in the handicapped stall of the girls' room.
We need to find someone to hook Tessa up with.
Would you like to sleep over tonight?
I don't think my mom would allow that.
Of course not.
Ha, ha.
I just don't want him to lose interest.
I won't.
What about Evan?
I know that he likes Tessa and he won't have conflicting plans because he's friendless.
- So win-win.
- Okay, you lovebirds, time for school.
Hip-hop, or you're gonna be late.
You two have a great day.
Ham and cheese, brother.
If you keep dating Lisa plenty more where that came from.
Why is she coming bed shopping with us?
Why am I coming bed shopping with you?
Because I want your opinion.
Well, I want Dallas to think we want her opinion.
I'm worried about her.
- Seemed manic last time I talked to her.
- Hey, y'all!
Hey.
Ah.
I hope I'm dressed okay.
I brought a raincoat, a walking coat a car coat and a cape, in case we see opera.
- We probably won't see opera.
- Yeah, probably no opera.
- We're going shopping for a bed.
- Oh, super fun.
Hey, can your car find us a European mattress store?
Prius.
Mattress store.
- Oh, yeah.
That place on Post Road?
- Let's do it.
- Evan.
- If you're here to pants me, don't.
I'm wearing a belt of staples that go into my skin.
I'm not here to pants you.
- I'm here to talk to you about Tessa.
- What about Tessa?
I know you like her and I wanna help you.
Are you the Great Houdini?
- Because if not, I doubt that she would...
- Look, Evan.
I'm black.
And black people know a lot about romance.
- Is that true?
- Al Green?
Al B. Sure?
- Huh?
- Jodeci?
Oran "Juice" Jones?
Teddy Riley?
Teddy Pendergrass?
Marvin Gaye?
- Yeah, but wasn't he...?
- No, Evan.
He wasn't.
Okay, maybe black people are smooth.
So, what do I have to do to make Tessa like me?
Heh.
A lot of things, Evan.
None of those things include wearing a belt made of staples that go into your skin.
It's like she expects people to feel sorry for her.
But, like, I don't feel sorry for her.
What do you feel?
Angerment.
Bitterness.
Resent.
You blame her for the divorce.
I do.
I totally do.
Until you put those words into my mouth, I didn't even realize I felt them.
Dalia, I think it's important that you confront her with these feelings.
Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to bring her in.
You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.
Yakult.
This session is not about you, it's about Dalia.
Now you sit.
And you listen.
I don't wanna see no panties tonight.
- What?
- What?
Take off that brassiere, my dear.
Evan, did you just tell me to take off my brassiere?
What?
No.
Wait, did you want me to tell you to do that?
- Wait, girl, I be trying to get with you.
- Evan.
Gross.
You just spit in my ear.
Really, you guys?
You're trying to unload me on Evan?
We didn't want you to feel like a third wheel.
- I didn't.
- Yeah, but at the yogurt shop...
- You were being gross.
- We're gonna continue to be gross.
Really gross.
We just don't want this to affect our friendship.
This affects our friendship, okay?
If I wanted a man, I could have one.
- I could have more than one.
- I'm open to that, you little freak.
I don't need you trying to pawn me off on some perv.
That's the furthest lever went with a girl, you guys.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
That seems good.
It's also comfortable for sleeping.
Heh, not gonna be doing a whole lot of sleeping on this baby, am I right?
It's the Rolls Royce of mattresses, sir.
It's the last one we have in stock.
Hand-tailored, Icelandic eiderdown cashmere-encased coils, hypoallergenic horsehair batting.

And I can assure you, there is not a finer mattress to be had.
- I'll take it.
- Excellent.
- All right.
- All right.
I know what you're thinking, and I totally agree.
It is obscene to spend that amount of money on a mattress.
"The honeymoon never has to end with the Eternal Honeymoon Sleep System."
Dallas?
Are you okay?
Maybe Steven and I just had the wrong mattress.
Oh, honey, no.
It wasn't that.
Oh.
Hi.
Should I put down a waterproof pad?
I am about to run your friend's card.
I really don't think that's necessary.
Okay, you know what?
Get the pad.
End of a long school week, and you know what?
I was glad to have the night to myself.
I was no third wheel.

You're wearing pajamas that are covered in food.
- These are fresh out of the wash.
- Look at all that butter.
Who'd eat that much butter?
I can't answer that question.
When I overheard my sister and Malik talking about trying to fix you up with someone I thought, "Tessa Altman made out with Ryan Shay.
She could have anyone."
But after watching you from the bushes tonight, I'm not so sure.
Ryan, wait.
I'm just not myself right now.
And, yes, maybe I am leaning on butter a little more than I normally would but I'm a recovering tricycle.
Trying to get by on one wheel.
Been there.
So you wanna get something to eat?
Your pajamas are making me hungry.
So we close soon.
George, get her off my bed.
She's funking it up.
- What do you want me to do?
- Fix it.
You're the one who brought her.
Oh, look.
It's Dalia.
Dallas, it's your daughter, Dalia.
No?
Hello?
Hey, Dalia.
Okay.
Okay, you're ready to be picked up?
Okay, great.
We're just running a few minutes late, so sit tight.
Dallas?
Dalia's ready to be picked up.
Are you gonna go get her?
- I have a dinner engagement.
- Okay, Noah, take my car keys.
Go pick up Dalia.
Kill some time before you bring her home.
I'll figure out a way to get Dallas out.
That's a promise.
- If Jill smells sorrow on this mattress-
- We have a no-return policy.
...Then you're buying it off of me.
Here.
Lock up when you leave.
If anything goes missing...
- ...it's going on your friend's card.
- Oh, okay.
Thank you for your understanding.
Hey, hey, big sale today, though, right?
Right.
Why didn't Mommy come get me herself?

Ugh.
And now look.
She's eating the whole spring roll when I only said she could have half.

This is why I wanted my own pet.
This is why I asked Mommy to get me the Hangover monkey like from that movie The Hangover.
I mean, she has Yakult on her side and I have no one.
I'm all alone.
Hey, have you seen that movie Kangaroo Jack?
No.
Is it good?

I want a bowl of cheese.

So go finish your fondue and we'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Well, you heard that.
She's fine.
So you can head on home.
Actually, we're kind of having a nice time.
Really?
Yeah.
I didn't even own one pair of shoes...
- ...when I walked barefoot into this country.
- Ew.
Within a year, I taught myself to speak English...
Carmen, honey, put a pin in it.
Dalia's mama's here to inspire her.
To speak English by listening to NPR's All Things Considered.
Dalia, I know you're mad at me.
I'm mad at me too.
And I'm mad at Steven.
And I'm mad at Carmen...
- You're mad at me?
- It isn't always rational.
It's hard to understand the choices I've made but I'm trying to show you that if you're unhappy in life it's your responsibility to fix it.
- No one else is gonna fix it for you.
- I know.
And that's why I made Uncle Noah buy me a Kangaroo Jack.
Dalia.
I'm pretty sure I was clear about no movie pets.
That said, he is a cute caramel color.
That I was not expecting.
And he makes me really happy, Mommy.
He does.
And I can keep my cell phone in his pocket.
Then, Carmen, we have a new member of the family.
Thank you so much, Mommy.
He is way cooler than the Hangover monkey.
So this was fun.
Thank you for getting me out of the house tonight.
My mom says when you wanna thank someone, send a thank-you card but I don't want a thank-you card.
I want you to let me touch your boob.
My boob?
Either boob.
Just so I can say I did, mostly.
You have three seconds.
Go for it.
So, what's your address?
You don't have to send a thank-you card.
Bye.
Ahh.
Throat looks good.
Pupils are dilating normally.
Do you want to sit up?
Any fever?
- She's cool to the touch.
- No.
Although I couldn't get her to submit to a core reading.
Uh, appetite?
Diminished.
Greatly diminished.
How's the mood?
Good?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
She's moody, but then she always has been.
Regular bowel movements, from what I can hear, but a mother's instinct, Dr. Roger.
Something's different.
She's off.
Mrs. shay, may I ask you to step into the waiting room for a moment?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's none of your business.
Being in love is nothing to be ashamed of.
Unless he's a drifter.
Are you in love with a drifter?
No.
It's not Arthur Fonzarelli, is it?
Because he's fictional.
Look, Lisa, I get it.
You're a tweenager, and tweenagers don't like talking to their parents.
I'm not a tweenager.
I'm practically old enough to vote.
Now you listen to me, Lisa Marie.
For years, I have sat here while you prattled on about your social life, when nothing even remotely interesting was going on!
Well, now that things are getting real,
I want details.
I want the dish.
Bring it on, sistah.
She broke your bed?
Buddy, Jill was doing things to me last night that would have broken a K.G.B. Agent.
She's got me open, buddy, wide open.
My theory is that she had been so repressed, so frigid for so many years that her sexual energy pent up inside of her like a Tsunami, and once I figured out how to unleash her waves, they have been crashing down on me every night, buddy!
Every night I have been surf in' my lady's brine.
Okay, I'm just gonna take this to go.
Oh, hell, I'll eat it.
Thank you.
I'm ravenous from all the intercourse.
I can't get enough sustenance to fuel the intercourse.
Mm.
Dallas!
Oh!
George, you startled me.
I was mid-tweet.
"#mid-tweet"... and send.
I'm all yours.
Well, I-I haven't seen you around recently.
- Everything good?
- So, so good!
If you read my last tweet, then you wouldn't have to ask.
Well, I'd rather ask.
When I don't see you, I worry about you, Dallas.
I mean, I think about you, and I know this must be kind of a rough time.
Rough time?
You know, with the divorce.
I heard it was finalized.
Why, yes, it was.
I got the papers this morning, and I had 'em laminated.
My divorce is so final, you could eat off it, which I did, and it tasted good.
Glad to hear you're eating well and keeping yourself...
Real, real busy.
I've been filling every second of every day with lots of real fun, super fun, real fun stuff.
Okay.
And then, come midnight,
I stone-cold medicate myself, and I sleep like a rock.
Oh.
Well, okay.
It sounds like you have a system, I guess, but, you know, things do have a way of catching up with you.
I know, which is why I have dalia in therapy five days a week.
Well, gotta run.
I have a pap smear, and then I'm taking Yakult to get blinged-out grillz like Nelly.
♪ last night I had a pleasant nightmare ♪
♪ Da-da-da-da, da, da, da, da ♪
- Who's there?
- Lisa shay.
Come in.
Hey.
Hey.
Tessa, let me just cut to the chase.
The story is about to break, and I want you to hear it from me first.
I have taken Malik...
As a lover.
I knew that.
Did my mother tell you?
I knew I couldn't trust her.
What?
No.
Lisa...
I could tell.
I saw you two the other day at the water fountain.

Where did you learn how to drink from a fountain, girl?
Pretty obvious.
I just...
I want you to know that although he and I will most likely be exploring parts of each other's bodies that are difficult to clean, my relationship with you will remain stet.
- "Stet"?
- Unchanged.
I won't abandon you, Tessa.
I didn't think you would.
'Cause I'm not the kind of girl that ditches her G.F. The minute she gets a B.F., you know, 'cause me and you...
We're for real.
We're like Thelma and that other ho.
Lisa, relax.
I'm happy for you and Malik, and the thought that you might ditch me, honestly, never even crossed my mind.
I'd take a bullet for you.
Thanks.
I was happy for Lisa and Malik.
Really, I was, but if I recalled correctly,
Thelma and Louise's relationship ended on kind of a down note.
How about "Lisik"?
Mm... it's okay.
I don't think it beats "Malisa."
Tessa, what do you think?
I think you two should maintain your individual identities and not feel compelled to fuse into one person just because you're dating.
Tessa, every couple has a couple name.
I wasn't going to argue with her.
Everything would be fine as long as she didn't ask Malik to...
Oh, Malik.
You've gotta taste my vanilla.

Yeah.

I should probably just go.
Well, I said it was for a dog when I booked the appointment.
Whose fault is that?
That's not my fault.
Well, I...
No, you can't cancel on me now, 'cause I've cleared my whole evening.
Bye, mommy.
Carmen's taking me to therapy.
Oh.
Hey!
Wait.
Carmen, what are you up to afterwards?
I go to see my Uncle.
Oh, super fun!
Mind if I come with?
He's in hospice.
Carmen!
See you later, mommy.
Okay then.
Okay.
I'll see you later, dalia and Carmen.
I'll see you both later then.
Thanks so much for having me over for breakfast.
Oh.
I think he has an Obama quality.
I see a young Obama...
Meets Denzel...
Meets Sammy Davis Jr...
You're just naming black people.
Meets Montell Jordan.
I actually get that a lot.
You're jiving me.
Really?
Mom.
Tessa.
She wants to know what's up for the weekend.
- Well, tell her you're hanging out with me.
- I'm afraid that if I do that, she'll spend the whole weekend hiding out in the handicapped stall of the girls' room.
- Mm.
- We need to find someone to hook Tessa up with, so she doesn't feel like a third wheel.
Would you like to sleep over tonight?
I-I don't think my mom would allow that.
Of course not.
I just don't want him to lose interest.
I won't.
What about Evan?
We already know that he likes Tessa, and he won't have any conflicting plans because he's friendless.
It's a win-win.
Okay, you lovebirds.
Time for school.
Hip-hop or you're gonna be late.
You two have a great day.
Ham and cheese, brother.
If you keep dating Lisa, plenty more where that came from.
Why is she coming bed shopping with us?
Why am I coming bed shopping with you?
Because I want your opinion.
Well, I want Dallas to think we want her opinion.
I'm worried about her.
She seemed a little manic the last time I talked to her.
Hi, y'all!
Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
Ohh.
I hope I'm dressed okay.
Since I didn't know what we were doing,
I brought a raincoat, a walking coat, a car coat, and a cape, in case we see opera.
We probably won't see opera.
Yeah, probably no opera.
We're going shopping for a bed.
Oh!
Super fun.
Hey, can your car find us...
A European mattress store?
Prius!
Mattress store!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, what about that place on post road?
Let's do it.
Evan.
Look, if you're here to pants me, don't waste your time.
I'm wearing a belt made of staples that go into my skin.
I'm not here to pants you.
I'm here to talk to you about Tessa.
What about Tessa?
Look, I know you like her, and I want to help you so that she likes you back.
Are you the great Houdini?
Because if not, Malik,
I seriously doubt that she would...
Look, Evan, I'm black, and black people know a lot about romance.
Is that true?
Al green, Al B. Sure!
Huh?
Jodeci, oran "juice" Jones, Teddy Riley,
Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin gaye?
Yeah, but wasn't he...
No.
Evan, he wasn't.
Okay.
Maybe black people are smoove.
So what do I have to do to make Tessa like me?
A lot of things, Evan, and none of those things include wearing a belt made of staples that go into your skin.
It's like she expects people to feel sorry for her, but, like, I don't feel sorry for her.
What do you feel?
Angerment.
Bitterness.
Resent.
You blame her for the divorce.
I do.
I totally do.
You know, until you put those words into my mouth,
I didn't even realize I felt them.
Dalia, I think it's important that you confront her with these feelings.
Now if it's okay with you,
I'd like to bring her in.
You have a lot of nerve showing your face here!
Yakult!
This session is not about you.
It's about dalia.
Now you sit...
And you listen.
I don't want to see no panties tonight.
- What?
-
-What?
Take off that brassiere, my dear.
Evan, did you just tell me to take off my brassiere?
What?
N-no!
Wait.
Did you want me to tell you to do that?
Wait!
But, girl, I be tryin' to get witchu!
Evan, gross.
You just spit in my ear.
Really, you guys?
You're trying to unload me on Evan?
Tessa, we just didn't want you to feel like a third wheel.
I didn't!
Uh, no, but the other day at the yogurt shop...
You were being gross.
And we're gonna continue to be gross, really gross.
We just don't want this to affect our friendship.
This affects our friendship, okay?
If I wanted a man, I could have one.
I could have more than one.
Hey, I'm open to that, you little freak.
I don't need you trying to pawn me off on some perv.
That's the furthest
I ever went with a girl, you guys.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
That seems... good.
It's also comfortable for sleeping.
Yeah, I'm not gonna be doing a whole lot of sleeping on this baby.
Am I right?
It's the Rolls-Royce of mattresses, sir.
Uh, the... it's the last one we have in stock.
Hand-tailored Icelandic eiderdown, cashmere-encased coils, hypoallergenic horsehair batting.
The boning, of course, is unbleached pine.
"The boning."
I like the sound of that.
You seem very comfortable in it, sir, a-and I can assure you, there is not a finer mattress to be had.
I'll take it.
Excellent.
All right.
All right.
Ohh.
I know what you're thinking, and I totally agree.
- It is obscene...
- To spend that amount of money on a mattress.
"The honeymoon never has to end with the eternal honeymoon sleep system."
Dallas, are you okay?
Maybe Steven and I just had the wrong mattress.
Oh, honey.
No.
It wasn't that.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Hi.
Should I put down a waterproof pad?
Because I am just about to run your friend's card.
I really don't think that's necessary.
Okay.
You know what?
Get the pad.
End of a long school week, and you know what?
I was glad to have the night to myself.
I was no third wheel.
I was a unicycle.
You are a unicycle.
You're a unicycle.
I'd start with a light dinner, watch a thought-provoking documentary...
Move...
That...
Bus!
Oh, my gosh!
Reconnect with some old friends...
Cool and cute.
And help myself to a little bedtime snack.
Ryan?
What are you doing out there, watching me?
Yes.
Why?
Tessa, look at you.
You fell off.
You're wearing pajamas that are covered in food.
These are fresh out of the wash.
Look at all that butter.
Who would eat that much butter?
I can't...
Answer that question.
When I overheard my sister and Malik talking about trying to fix you up with someone, I thought,
Tessa Altman made out with Ryan shay.
She could have anyone, but after watching you from the bushes tonight,
I'm not so sure.
Ryan, wait.
I'm just...
Not myself right now, and, yes, maybe I am leaning on butter a little more than I normally would, but...
I'm a recovering tricycle, trying to get by on one wheel.
Been there.
So you wanna get something to eat?
Your pajamas are making me hungry.
So we close soon.
George, get her off my bed.
She's funkin' it up.
What do you want me to do?
Fix it!
You're the one who brought her with us.
Uh...
Oh, look.
It's dalia.
Dallas, it's your daughter dalia.
No?
Hello?
Hey, dalia.
Okay.
Okay.
You're... you're ready to be picked up?
Okay, great.
We're just running a few minutes late, so sit tight.
Dallas, dalia's ready to be picked up.
Are you gonna go get her?
I have a dinner engagement.
Okay.
Noah, take my car keys.
Go pick up dalia from her shrink.
Kill some time before you bring her home.
I will figure out a way to get Dallas out of this bed.
That's a promise, okay?
If Jill smells sorrow on this mattress...
We have a no-return policy.
Then you're buying it off of me.
Lock up when you leave.
If anything goes missing, it's going on your friend's card.
Uh, okay.
Thank you for your understanding.
Hey, okay, big sale today, though, right?
Right.
Why didn't mommy come get me herself?
Mommy...
Mommy is having a hard time right now.
She's going through some things.
Oh, please.
What's her problem?
She didn't want to live with daddy any more, but I did.
I guess that's true, isn't it?
Here, yakult.
You can have half of my spring roll.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that, Uncle Noah?
She almost bit me!
She almost bit me because I said something bad about mommy.
The two of them are total cohorts, if that's a word.
Oh, and now look.
She's eating the whole spring roll, when I only said she could have half.
Here.
You can have mine.
This is why I wanted my own pet.
This is why I asked mommy to please get me
"the hangover" monkey, like from that movie "the hangover."
I mean, she has yakult on her side, and I have no one.
I'm all alone.
Hey, have you seen that movie "kangaroo Jack"?
No.
Is it good?
I laid around a lot.
I watched a lot of "people's court,"
a court in which justice was almost never served, but then I realized, when you're a single parent, being depressed is a luxury you just can't afford.
You have to get up and take care of your kid, 'cause no one else is gonna do it for you.
I have Carmen.
Yes, you have Carmen to cook and to clean and to drive dalia the places she needs to go, but Carmen can't inspire dalia.
She can't teach her what it means to get up when you feel down.
Carmen isn't dalia's mother.
You are, and that right there is reason enough to climb off this outrageously comfortable mattress, this mattress that is clearly from heaven.
George, am I okay?
Of course you're okay.
I've never been...
Depressed.
It's standard issue.
Comes free with the divorce.
I don't even know what a depressed person dresses like.
Separates?
I'm probably gonna need a whole new depression wardrobe.
I'll probably need a whole new wardrobe.

Okay, it was me.
I want a bowl of wet, hot cheese, and this place has it.
Plus wait till you see how long their forks are.
Okay.
Yeah!
Well, let's just get in there before they see us.
Are you sure you're okay with this?
'Cause I know they don't serve any of the food that was listed on your pajamas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't only eat... food that's on my pajamas.
Okay.
Whew.
'Cause I feel like
I may have oversold the forks a little.
No, they're big.
Yeah.
Aah.
Oh, my God, Malik.
Aah!
Ow!
Damn, girl!
Where did you learn how to feed someone fondue?
Do you see this?
My heart is breaking.
Tessa's bottomed out.
I'm bleeding.
You stabbed me in the gums.
Tessa, wait.
Don't run.
I'm not running.
I'm seated.
I can't even imagine how lost you must feel to resort to Ryan.
I...
Lisa, I'm fine.
You have to stop pitying me.
For a minute there, you had me pitying myself.
It's true.
I caught her eating butter.
Now that I think about it, it's kinda messed up that I brought you out for cheese.
You're gonna have wicked gas tonight.
Probably.
Listen, Lisa, you don't have to feel guilty about doing things without me.
I'm a big girl, okay, so go finish your fondue, and we'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Well, you heard that.
She's fine, so you can head on home.
Actually...
We're kinda having a nice time.
Really?
Really?
Yeah.
I didn't even own one pair of shoes when I walked barefoot into this country.

Every night I have been surfing my lady's brine.

Why is she coming bed shopping with us?
Why am I coming bed shopping with you?
Because I want your opinion.
Well, I want Dallas to think we want her opinion.
I'm worried about her.
- Seemed manic last time I talked to her.
DALLAS:
Hey, y'all!
GEORGE NOAH:
Hey.
Ah.
I hope I'm dressed okay.
I brought a raincoat, a walking coat a car coat and a cape, in case we see opera.
- We probably won't see opera.
- Yeah, probably no opera.
- We're going shopping for a bed.
DALLAS:
Oh, super fun.
Hey, can your car find us a European mattress store?
Prius.
Mattress store.
- Oh, yeah.
That place on Post Road?
NOAH:
Let's do it.
- Evan.
- If you're here to pants me, don't.
I'm wearing a belt of staples that go into my skin.
I'm not here to pants you.
- I'm here to talk to you about Tessa.
- What about Tessa?
I know you like her and I wanna help you.
[LAUGHS THEN SNORTS]
Are you the Great Houdini?
- Because if not, I doubt that she would...
- Look, Evan.
I'm black.
And black people know a lot about romance.
- Is that true?
- Al Green?
Al B. Sure?
- Huh?
- Jodeci?
Oran "Juice" Jones?
Teddy Riley?
Teddy Pendergrass?
Marvin Gaye?
- Yeah, but wasn't he...?
- No, Evan.
He wasn't.
Okay, maybe black people are smooth.
So, what do I have to do to make Tessa like me?
Heh.
A lot of things, Evan.
None of those things include wearing a belt made of staples that go into your skin.
It's like she expects people to feel sorry for her.
But, like, I don't feel sorry for her.
What do you feel?
Angerment.
Bitterness.
Resent.
You blame her for the divorce.
I do.
I totally do.
Until you put those words into my mouth, I didn't even realize I felt them.
Dalia, I think it's important that you confront her with these feelings.
Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to bring her in.
[BARKING]
You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.
Yakult.
This session is not about you, it's about Dalia.
Now you sit.
And you listen.
[WHIMPERS]
I don't wanna see no panties tonight.
- What?
- What?
Take off that brassiere, my dear.
Evan, did you just tell me to take off my brassiere?
What?
No.
Wait, did you want me to tell you to do that?
- Wait, girl, I be trying to get with you.
- Evan.
Gross.
You just spit in my ear.
Really, you guys?
You're trying to unload me on Evan?
We didn't want you to feel like a third wheel.
- I didn't.
- Yeah, but at the yogurt shop...
- You were being gross.
- We're gonna continue to be gross.
Really gross.
We just don't want this to affect our friendship.
This affects our friendship, okay?
If I wanted a man, I could have one.
- I could have more than one.
- I'm open to that, you little freak.
I don't need you trying to pawn me off on some perv.
That's the furthest lever went with a girl, you guys.
[GRUNTING]
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
That seems good.
It's also comfortable for sleeping.
Heh, not gonna be doing a whole lot of sleeping on this baby, am I right?
It's the Rolls Royce of mattresses, sir.
It's the last one we have in stock.
Hand-tailored, Icelandic eiderdown cashmere-encased coils, hypoallergenic horsehair batting.
- The boning is unbleached pine.
- The boning.
- Ha, ha.
I love the sound of that.
- You seem very comfortable in it, sir.
And I can assure you, there is not a finer mattress to be had.
- I'll take it.
- Excellent.
NOAH:
All right.
MANAGER:
All right.
I know what you're thinking, and I totally agree.
It is obscene to spend that amount of money on a mattress.
"The honeymoon never has to end with the Eternal Honeymoon Sleep System."
Dallas?
Are you okay?
Maybe Steven and I just had the wrong mattress.
Oh, honey, no.
It wasn't that.
[DALLAS SOBBING]
Oh.
Hi.
Should I put down a waterproof pad?
I am about to run your friend's card.
I really don't think that's necessary.
[DALLAS SOBBING]
Okay, you know what?
Get the pad.
TESSA:
End of a long school week, and you know what?
I was glad to have the night to myself.
I was no third wheel.
I was a unicycle.
You are a unicycle.
You're a unicycle.
TESSA:
I'd start with a light dinner.
Watch a thought-provoking documentary.
Move that bus!
Oh, my gosh.
[SOBBING]
TESSA:
Reconnect with some old friends.
Cool and cute.
TESSA:
And help myself to a little bedtime snack.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Oh.
Ryan?
What are you doing out there?
Watching me?
Yes.
- Why?
- Tessa, look at you.
You fell off.
You're wearing pajamas that are covered in food.
- These are fresh out of the wash.
- Look at all that butter.
Who'd eat that much butter?
I can't answer that question.
When I overheard my sister and Malik talking about trying to fix you up with someone I thought, "Tessa Altman made out with Ryan Shay.
She could have anyone."
But after watching you from the bushes tonight, I'm not so sure.
Ryan, wait.
I'm just not myself right now.
And, yes, maybe I am leaning on butter a little more than I normally would but I'm a recovering tricycle.
Trying to get by on one wheel.
Been there.
So you wanna get something to eat?
Your pajamas are making me hungry.
So we close soon.
George, get her off my bed.
She's funking it up.
- What do you want me to do?
- Fix it.
You're the one who brought her.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Oh, look.
It's Dalia.
Dallas, it's your daughter, Dalia.
No?
Hello?
Hey, Dalia.
Okay.
Okay, you're ready to be picked up?
Okay, great.
We're just running a few minutes late, so sit tight.
Dallas?
Dalia's ready to be picked up.
Are you gonna go get her?
- I have a dinner engagement.
- Okay, Noah, take my car keys.
Go pick up Dalia.
Kill some time before you bring her home.
I'll figure out a way to get Dallas out.
That's a promise.
- If Jill smells sorrow on this mattress-
- We have a no-return policy.
...Then you're buying it off of me.
Here.
Lock up when you leave.
If anything goes missing...
- ...it's going on your friend's card.
- Oh, okay.
Thank you for your understanding.
Hey, hey, big sale today, though, right?
Right.
[SIGHS]
Why didn't Mommy come get me herself?
Mommy...
Mommy is having a hard time right now.
She's going through some things.
Oh, please.
What's her problem?
She didn't wanna live with Daddy any more, but I did.
I guess that's true, isn't it?
[BARKING]
Here, Yakult.
You can have half of my spring roll.
Oh, my God, did you see that, Uncle Noah?
She almost bit me.
She almost bit me because I said something bad about Mommy.
The two of them are total cohorts, if that's a word.
Ugh.
And now look.
She's eating the whole spring roll when I only said she could have half.
Here.
You can have mine.
This is why I wanted my own pet.
This is why I asked Mommy to get me the Hangover monkey like from that movie The Hangover.
I mean, she has Yakult on her side and I have no one.
I'm all alone.
Hey, have you seen that movie Kangaroo Jack?
[SNIFFS]
No.
Is it good?
I laid around a lot.
I watched a lot of People's Court.
A court in which justice was almost never served.
But then I realized when you're a single parent, being depressed is a luxury you can't afford.
You have to get up and take care of your kid.
Because no one else is gonna do it for you.
I have Carmen.
Yes.
You have Carmen to cook and to clean and to drive Dalia to the places she needs to go.
But Carmen can't inspire Dalia.
She can't teach her what it means to get up when you feel down.
Carmen isn't Dalia's mother.
You are.
And that right there is reason enough to climb off this outrageously comfortable mattress.
This mattress that is clearly from heaven.
[SIGHS]
George?
Am I okay?
Of course you're okay.
- I've never been...
- Depressed.
It's standard issue.
Comes free with the divorce.
I don't even know what a depressed person dresses like.
[CHUCKLES]
Separates?
I'm probably gonna need a whole new depression wardrobe.
[GASPS]
I'll probably need a whole new wardrobe.
Damn, girl.
Where'd you learn how to eat fondue?
[LISA LAUGHING]
Uh, let's go somewhere else.
I thought you said you wanted a bowl of wet, hot cheese.
- I don't remember saying...
- It was me.
I want a bowl of cheese.
This place has it.
Plus, wait till you see how long their forks are.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Let's just get in there before they see us.
Sure you're okay with this?
They don't serve any of the food on your pajamas.
Yeah, heh, I don't only eat food that's on my pajamas.
Okay.
Phew.
Because I feel like I may have oversold the forks.
- No, they're big.
- Yeah.
[TESSA CHUCKLES]
LISA:
Oh, my God, Malik.
- Aah.
Damn.
Where'd you learn how to feed someone fondue?
LISA:
Do you see this?
My heart is breaking.
- Tessa's bottomed out.
- I'm bleeding.
You stabbed me.
Tessa, wait.
Don't run.
I'm not running.
I'm seated.
I can't even imagine how lost you must feel.
To resort to Ryan.
I...
Lisa, I'm fine.
You have to stop pitying me.
For a minute there, you had me pitying myself.
It's true.
I caught her eating butter.
It's messed up I brought you out for cheese.
You're gonna have wicked gas tonight.
Probably.
Listen, Lisa.
You don't have to feel guilty about doing things without me.
I'm a big girl.
Okay?
So go finish your fondue and we'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Well, you heard that.
She's fine.
So you can head on home.
Actually, we're kind of having a nice time.
BOTH:
Really?
Yeah.
CARMEN:
I didn't even own one pair of shoes...
- ...when I walked barefoot into this country.
- Ew.
Within a year, I taught myself to speak English...
Carmen, honey, put a pin in it.
Dalia's mama's here to inspire her.
To speak English by listening to NPR's All Things Considered.
Dalia, I know you're mad at me.
I'm mad at me too.
And I'm mad at Steven.
And I'm mad at Carmen...
- You're mad at me?
- It isn't always rational.
It's hard to understand the choices I've made but I'm trying to show you that if you're unhappy in life it's your responsibility to fix it.
- No one else is gonna fix it for you.
DALIA:
I know.
And that's why I made Uncle Noah buy me a Kangaroo Jack.
Dalia.
I'm pretty sure I was clear about no movie pets.
That said, he is a cute caramel color.
That I was not expecting.
And he makes me really happy, Mommy.
He does.
And I can keep my cell phone in his pocket.
Then, Carmen, we have a new member of the family.
Thank you so much, Mommy.
He is way cooler than the Hangover monkey.
[PANS CRASHING]
[CARMEN SCREAMS]
So this was fun.
Thank you for getting me out of the house tonight.
My mom says when you wanna thank someone, send a thank-you card but I don't want a thank-you card.
I want you to let me touch your boob.
My boob?
Either boob.
Just so I can say I did, mostly.
You have three seconds.
Go for it.
[CLEARS THROAT]
So, what's your address?
You don't have to send a thank-you card.
Bye.
[English

Previously on The Firm
Mitch took the drive.
I don't know where, and neither does she.
And since you don't know where to find the drive,
I don't need you anymore.
Let's make a deal.
At 2100 hours, you will drive to Dulles Airport Access Road and you will wait for further instructions.
I don't care about the drive, I just want Abby.
McDeere's wife doesn't know where the drive is.
How do you know?
Let's just say we asked her in a way that encouraged the truth.
You tortured her
- Stack?
- I told you to come alone.
You're under arrest as a material witness in an FBI investigation.
If a judge rules he's not a material witness, the FBI have no right to search the drive.
Then get McDeere out, and get us that drive.
Cuff yourselves.
I've known Abby longer than I've known my own wife.
You just find Abby.
- You're in federal custody.
- Not anymore.
I got out, and we got the drive.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do -
No, hey, you listen to me!
Meet me at the park near Grace Church on the south side of the street.
It's the only option we have at this point.
Wait 'til we make contact.
When I give the order, drive her in.
- Do you have the drive?
- Where's Abby?
Close.
You know, I have to say
I underestimated what you and your family are capable of.
When Sarah violated protocol, asked the court to assign her a lawyer,
I guess it was bad luck for both of us.
You win, Stack.
I just want my wife back.
It's not about winning, it's about shifting the balance.
I don't give a damn about your mission.
Show me my wife, or I will walk away right now.
You know, we're not too different, you and I.
We make choices everyday - which client to fight for... which ones you can't save...
- You and I are nothing alike.
- Don't be too sure.
It's easy to think of me as a monster.
Killing.
People can't look past it.
That's something you learn to get over as a soldier;
People die.
And no amount of wasted money or tears can stop it.
Drive her in.
- I need to see her.
- Not possible.
You chose this place,
I can't drag her out in front of everyone.
When I get the drive, my men in the car will walk away.
How do I know that that's Abby?
How do I know it's the real drive?
It seems we've come to the point where we're just going to have to trust each other.
Excuse me...
Uh, I like your camera.
I've been thinking about getting one of those.
You should.
You mind if I take a look?
Sure.
Great, thanks.
My people won't be patient much longer.
Do we have a deal?
Thank you.
Where are you going?
McDeere!
You do not want to test me!
- What happened?
- It's not her.
What - how do you know?
Because I can see it wasn't her wedding ring.
It's not her.
It's a set-up.
Look, are you sure?
We're not getting a second chance.
It's not her.
He didn't bring her.
Why wouldn't he bring her?
If she was alive, he would have let us see her.
You...
You don't know that.
She's dead.
He killed her.
He never planned to let us see her.
I have to talk to Claire, I have to see Claire.
I did this.
It's my fault!
Hey, you didn't do anything!
We were all in this, right from the start!
We all go wrapped up in it.
And it's not over yet.
Stack's crazy, and if that wasn't Abby in the car, he's comin' after us now.
Mitch, we can find her.
FBI's gonna help us.
Come on, get in the car.
I don't have the drive.
McDeere wouldn't give it up.
You're a persuasive guy, Kevin.
How's that possible?
- He demanded to see his wife.
- And?
And I couldn't make that happen.
- The situation went bad.
- Bad how?
You know what - don't tell me.
It doesn't matter now.
If McDeere gives the real drive to the feds, nothing we do is going to matter!
My thoughts exactly.
But every mission comes to an end.
The safe play now is to eject.
You're leaving?
Doesn't have to be alone.
Emotion's not my strong point, Alex, but the truth is, I've come to... care about you and what we have.
Kevin...
I've made arrangements at the airport.
I can have someone pick you up.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
You know how I feel, but my life is here.
My firm...
The FBI will come at you.
I'm ready for that.
Nothing they have connects to me.
I made sure the trail ends with the other 3 partners that are involved.
I expected as much.
Goodbye, Alex.
Like hell it's over.
This won't be over until you charge him with obstructing justice.
You keep pointing that finger at me, it's going to be obstructing your windpipe.
He's angry, Lewis.
I'm angry.
I went after McDeere to make a point.
We all need to trust the system.
I have zero tolerance for cowboys.
I didn't think I had to make that point to you.
It's his wife, Diane.
The system can take a backseat for a minute.
You hear this?
I'm arresting him right now.
It won't stick!
I signed the McDeeres out for a debriefing and they overpowered me.
You don't even know where they are.
You don't even know if they're still in the city.
Miss.
Ruckheiser...
Mitch and Ray McDeere are here to see you.
Here?
Yes, ma'am.
They're in the lobby with a nervous Russian.
We didn't get her - Stack still has Abby.
Do you have any idea where he's holding her?
Did he give you any clue?
We don't even know if she's alive.
Look, you have to help us!
There is a drive in there that we got from Stack.
Now on it is information that proves that he's killing Noble Insurance patients.
It's encrypted.
It's military grade.
I got close, but I couldn't access the full key.
Who the hell is this guy?
Dimitri Portnoy, a friend from my days at Brushy Mountain.
He's been helping us out.
Unofficially...
I'm on parole.
I'm not supposed to touch computers.
Wayne, take Mr. Portnoy and the drive to the techs.
Mr. Portnoy, if you can speed up our access,
I'll personally take care of your parole.
What about Abby?
What are you gonna do for her?
Mitch... we've got most of my people on it.
I'm gonna go see where they're at.
We're ready, Diane.
You have to hear the whole story.
Lewis Coleman.
Marshall Coleman, this is Officer Ford, DC Police.
I'm out in the seventh district.
I'm calling about a woman named Abby McDeere...
She's been found.
Her body's been found?
Oh no, Marshall...
I mean yes, but not like that.
She's alive.
She was picked up by a passing motorist.
Obviously been through a lot of trauma.
She won't say much.
Seems to be in some kind of shock.
I ran her prints and got an alert to notify you.
Can you put her on, please?
I can try.
We're gonna take her to the hospital...
Get her looked at.
That's when the court appointed Sarah's case to me.
Now she was supposed to call Stack.
But she broke protocol.
Sarah admitted that?
We found her!
Mitch...
It's Abby.
- Abby?
- Mitch?
Oh, God, I thought I lost you.
Are you okay?
I love you.
We had to give her a sedative.
She should be fine.
So she's not hurt?
It's hard to know what we're dealing with.
There are no apparent injuries, but her anxietal level is so high, it's affecting her vitals.
- Like a panic attack?
- Yeah, exhaustion, anxiety...
I don't know what she went through, but whatever it was, it took an emotional toll.
We'll keep her for now, see how she does.
Thank you.
Not injured.
Yeah, but something happened to her.
And how did she get away?
I don't know, I guess we'll figure that out.
Claire...
Your mom's gonna be okay.
They've just given her something to sleep.
What happened to her?
They don't know.
They're gonna keep her here overnight, and just make sure that everything's fine.
So what about the hard drive?
Feds have it, they're crackin' it now.
- And Stack?
- We left him at Grace Park.
I hear Abby's doing well.
Here it comes.
Here what comes?
You always want something, Tarrance.
You don't have to feign interest in Abby.
Just get on with it.
Our techs are cracking the drive.
Dimitri's been a big help, but we could use you there to put the evidence into context.
- How long do you need?
- A couple hours.
You'd be back before Abby's up.
Just go, honey.
We'll stay here in case she wakes up.
The agents are with us, and you and Ray should finish it.
It's not gonna be over until Alex and Stack are convicted.
The hard drive contains 3 discrete files.
The first has a formula:
patient's name, medical condition, are entered here.
That triggers a number of input fields.
Formal diagnosis, prescriptions...
Age, family history, prior surgery.
Right, so the first part gives you a clear picture of the patient's condition.
Then it calculates life expectancy.
You can see here, this patient was expected to live for another 17 months.
And that file cross-references with the cost?
Stack has been doing the math, seeing who costs the company the most.
Right, then they assign the patient a number.
More money they cost, the higher the number.
And that's how Stack chooses who to kill.
Now, the second file seems to be a database of victims.
They're all Noble patients, all diagnosed with terminal conditions.
- Any patterns?
- Not really.
Male, female, as young as 20, as old as 98.
Homes, hospices...
That's Margaret Whittaker, the woman that Sarah murdered.
Can we see that one?
Looks like she was projected to cost the company two million over the next fourteen months.
Wow.
How many victims in total?
Well, the hard drive has 117 patients that we can't confirm are dead,
Well, the hard drive but it looks that way.
But there are another 46 that were scheduled for termination.
Thanks to you guys, they're now under our protection.
What about the third file on the drive?
Those are Stack's people.
Sarah is one of them
- Any names?
- No, just numbers
Probably people Stack knew from his days in the army.
We're that.
And Stack?
Alex Clark?
Those arrests are happening as we speak.
Before the deposition, let's get emails, texts, everything that predates the contract.
I'm sorry, what exactly is going on here?
- Alex Clark?
- Yes.
We need you to come with us.
Hands behind your back, please.
What is this about?
It's fine, I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
117 counts of murder?
One hell of a misunderstanding.
Excuse me...
You can't -
We don't have him.
Track his cell, credit cards, everything!
Get his face up at the airports.
What about the flight plan?
I don't give a damn.
Just file it.
Where to, Major?
Warfield.
We need a private air strip.
I can arrange for the equipment.
Negative, Sergeant.
Everything's arranged.
I've known this day might come for quite a while.
Is the mission over, sir?
Are we standing down?
Kevin Stack.
The FBI just left your office.
Good thing I wasn't in it.
Hardly a time for jokes.
Can I assume this precious mission of yours is blown?
Looks that way.
Then you need to come in.
We need to know what we're dealing with here.
That's not a good idea.
Your judgement, Kevin, as to what constitutes a good idea at this point is worth less than nothing.
Now if you intend to disappear and leave us holding a bag of federal questions, you will at least come in and help us answer them before you go.
You're a smart guy, Allard, you'll think of something.
Oh, I am a smart guy, Kevin.
And a connected one.
Now you either come here now, or we'll come get you.
And whoever we send will not be in as good a mood as I am now.
Where?
I'm still at the Washington Hilton, the Presidential suite.
If the feds are looking for me, I'm not walking into the Hilton.
Go in the back.
You'll find a freight elevator just past the massive kitchen.
Next time you threaten me, Allard,
I will not be in as good a mood as I am now.
Look at you.
All your power.
You ever fight for anything, Allard?
You ever care about anything other than money?
Agent Tarrance!
You didn't.
If I go down, so do you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Agent Tarrance, this company will do everything in its power to help your investigation.
Kevin Stack, you're under arrest for the murder of...
Ah, hell, maybe I should list the people you didn't murder.
It might take less time.
Abby was picked up on the road about 200 yards north.
She must have been making a run for it.
Building's been abandoned for years.
This must be where Stack had her taken for questioning.
So who's this guy?
Maybe the guy that was asking the questions.
You think Abby did this?
We'll have to ask.
You know what this is for...
Not something you see everyday.
Waterboarding a civilian - A schoolteacher.
Yeah, well, Stack's military.
His guys are ex-army.
They did waterboard tests on CIA operatives.
The average agent could only hold back the truth for 16 seconds.
My God.
Can you just imagine what she went through?
Hey...
How you doing?
I'm right here.
Everyone's here.
Claire?
She's just down the hall with Ray and Tammy.
We've been rotating.
We didn't want you to get overwhelmed.
I'm...
I'm okay.
I'm so sorry, Abby.
You want to tell me what happened?
Where you were?
What they did to you?
It's okay, you don't have to talk about it.
You can tell me when you're ready.
Stack?
He's been arrested.
It's over, Abby.
The feds, they have the drive.
They know everything.
Andrew's dead.
The police found his body in the river.
What about Alex?
She was also arrested.
The US Attorney picked her up today at the office.
Good.
It's your choice, Miss.
Clark.
You can continue to deny involvement -
You mean tell the truth?
And take your chances, but... lawyer to lawyer, you have my word:
When we prove you guilty, this office will have no mercy for you.
Lawyer to lawyer -
Last time I checked, you can prove a case without evidence.
We'll get it.
We arrested Kevin Stack.
He might have a lot to say about the lawyer who failed to keep him out of prison.
Somehow I doubt it.
And I'm innocent, so anything he did say would be a lie.
You knew Kevin Stack was terminating Noble patients.
You knew Sarah Holt was a hired killer.
You pressured Andrew Palmer to bring Mitch McDeere in-house as a way to control Sarah's case.
How does this work, Diane?
You just keep listing things you think I did, and then, what - I break down and confess?
Here's my confession:
I was terribly naive.
Apparently Stack was working with some of my colleagues behind my back.
Andrew Palmer is probably the ringleader.
Our records show that he set up some secret room at the firm for Stack to keep files.
But you knew nothing about that?
No.
We preserved those files for your review.
They connect Stack to several other attorneys at Kinross, but not me.
We also found proof of payment made to those lawyers by Noble Insurance.
Very neat and clean.
My office will also send over a log for the those who accessed the room.
Proves I was never inside.
Before his death,
Andrew Palmer made it clear that you were helping Kevin Stack.
Really...
Well, that sounds like...
What's the word...
Hearsay.
If you say so.
You're the trial lawyer.
You killed a lot of people, Alex.
Not just Kevin Stack, not just his loyal soldiers.
You.
And you will go down for your part in this.
I'm just getting started.
Shot in the dark here, but I'm guessing Yale law.
That's right.
Makes sense.
You Yalies are so conceptual.
No time for practical realities like facts.
I'm a Georgetown gal.
A bulldog, just like your boss, Frank Shore.
We're old friends.
You don't have enough to charge me and you know it.
Even worse, I know it.
So... maybe we can cut the rest of our little chat short.
Hm?
You can't release her!
I don't want to release her, Mitch, but she's right.
We don't have enough to charge.
I can testify.
To what?
She didn't choose which victims to kill, she didn't do the killing.
She is Stack's partner!
She is equally responsible, and you know it.
Yeah, I do know that.
And I just told Alex I wouldn't rest until the day I could prove it.
But, sadly, that day is not today.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
This thing is really blowing up.
117 counts of murder, that gets some attention around here.
Diane, we have to talk about this.
We're arresting 3 other lawyers at Kinross, our agents are picking them up right now.
And they would not help Stack without Alex's blessing.
We'll talk later.
Between Stack, his soldiers, and three lawyers, we have enough to focus on.
They're not charging Alex?
Can you change it?
Can you convince her?
Well, we could try and go over her head...
You talk to her.
You said Diane was smart.
If there's a way, she'll get on board.
Mitch... we cannot let her get away with what she did.
To us.
You going down?
There she is.
It's good to see you up.
A few days ago it was you in here.
Did I miss Mitch?
Yeah, he went to see Diane Ruckheiser.
She released Alex.
Ray and Tammy are just in the waiting room.
They could fill you in on the gaps, if that's what you need.
No, no.
Actually, I came to see you.
We found the room where you were being held.
So you know what else we found.
And who else we found.
I assume that you did what was necessary to get away.
There won't be an investigation.
It's closed.
Now, the water and the white cloth...
Were they used?
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry, Abby.
I know guys who've been through that.
And it stayed with them for a long time.
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe.
Have you told the doctors?
Have you told Mitch?
You need to tell him.
Not yet.
You can't get out the other side of this without the people that you love.
You need to tell Mitch.
I'll tell him when I'm ready.
You promise me.
Lewis...
I need to tell him in my own time.
I'm on your side, Mitch.
You may not believe that, but it's true.
Then why don't you start acting like it, Diane.
Alex Clark is guilty.
I don't care if you have sufficient evidence.
The feds hold people all the time without proof!
You practically made it an art form!
Hey!
What is going on with you?
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not anything close to fine.
You're a wreck.
You want to pick a fight with me, you can.
Will it change anything?
It won't.
You got yourself into a mess, Mitch.
And it's not going away.
So you can stand here and yell at me, or go help your family start moving forward.
Might be easier to yell at you.
I'm sure.
It's okay, Mitch.
Maybe not today...
But it will be.
Okay, sit here.
We've got a blanket, pillows from upstairs, remote, tissues...
Fantastic.
Anything you need, just tell me and I'll get it.
Ah, I like this.
I should get sick more often.
I'm sorry, Claire.
It's okay.
So am I.
- For what?
- Everything.
We were okay in the program.
I didn't hate it.
Why would you say that?
Well, I just mean...
I know we left because you guys wanted me to have a normal life.
You listen, we left because we all wanted to have a normal life.
You have nothing to feel guilty about, do you hear me?
Yeah.
- I like your hair.
- Thanks.
Tammy did it.
Socks...
I'll get your fuzzy ones.
There you go.
Do you want anything else?
I think Claire's got it under control.
How you feeling?
I just need to sit here for a while.
You going to Stack's arraignment?
I don't have to.
No, you should go.
If you wanted to talk...
I still don't know what happened.
I told you, we'll talk about it when I'm ready.
I know, but it's just, I...
Babe, it's me.
What's goin' on?
Mitch, I can't help you with this right now.
- What does that mean?
- It means...
It means you should go to the arraignment.
117 counts of murder.
That's what they're investigating.
Today, they'll charge a much lower amount.
Maybe ten or 20.
We also just got notice that the US Attorney may decide to pursue the death penalty.
They won't follow through with it.
They'll offer life without parole to avoid a trial.
Doesn't matter if it's true, Kevin.
It's enough that it's even a possibility.
What now?
It doesn't look good.
We knew what would happen if the feds got the drive.
Who do they have?
They're putting names to the faces of your people.
They're focused on finding the actual killers.
They also arrested the three partners at Kinross.
But not you.
They tried.
I was ready.
The other partners could talk, put you at the centre.
Just words.
They won't be able to prove the connection.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
I tried to protect you and the company but it just wasn't possible.
That doesn't work for me.
I brought you in to handle this.
And that's what I expect to happen.
I wish I could, but you knew the risk.
Listen to me.
You will figure this out.
You will find a way to get me out of here.
Or what?
Or you're going down with the rest of us.
Here's some new information for you, Alex.
I recorded every conversation you and I ever had about this mission of ours.
- That's not true.
- Doesn't matter if it's true.
It's enough that it's even a possibility.
It's conflict for me to represent you.
I'll waive any conflict.
It's worth it to me to have a lawyer so motivated.
Calling CR-12461.
United States vs. Kevin Stack.
Defendant is charged with 15 counts of murder.
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
We're only charging 15, but the FBI is investigating over 100 suspected killings.
Order.
Quiet!
I'm only going to say this once.
If the gallery, including the members of the press, disrupt this process again.
Alex Clark for the defendant.
Waive reading of the rights and charges.
So waived.
Mr. Stack, how do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honour.
Your Honour, my office is investigating
Miss.
Clark's role in this enterprise.
We object to her serving as counsel.
Any conflict's been waived by my client, Your Honour.
And if Diane had anything real,
I'd be waiting for my arraignment.
She's right, Miss Ruckheiser,
I can't exclude her because you think she's involved.
The defendant is held without bail.
- Any motions?
- Yes, Your Honour.
The defence will be moving to suppress the hard drive taken from my client.
On what grounds?
On the grounds that it was stolen.
We don't know anything about that.
The drive was provided to us by a private citizen.
- The Fourth Amendment?
- The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure by law enforcement.
We're allowed to use evidence turned in by private citizens.
Unless those private citizens are acting as agents of the police.
You met with Mitch McDeere.
He asked you to start an investigation.
You told him to come back with hard evidence.
I never encouraged any illegal activity.
You couldn't get a warrant for the drive, so you instructed him to do what you couldn't do yourself.
Oh, I won't stand here and listen to this.
Your Honour, this man and those loyal to him killed over 100 people.
We are talking about one of the most vile, mass murderers in modern criminal history.
I want a hearing.
My client was almost killed by Mitch McDeere and his brother, a convicted felon.
- Are we done?
- We are done.
For today.
But I'm granting the hearing.
Your Honour...
It's 100 murders, Miss Ruckheiser.
All hinging on one key piece of evidence.
Any judge would look at the circumstances.
If you didn't blow it, you'll be fine.
What the hell did they do to you, Abbs?
They wanted the hard drive, and they thought I knew where it was.
And they forced you to tell them?
I told them about Dimitri.
But I didn't know where he lived.
I tried to lie, but... they do it so that you think you're drowning.
Oh God.
Does Mitch know?
Honestly, Tammy, when I see him, the things I want to say to him...
It's better that I don't.
These things that happen to us, they're not just bad luck.
He looks for them.
He finds them, and then he refuses to walk away.
You really think that?
He talks about being a big lawyer, about all that potential being taken away, but he's just scared.
What if he's not that great?
Well, this way, he never has to find out.
Big future interrupted again.
Honey, you're angry.
That's understandable.
I'm not just angry, Tammy.
I'm...
I'm different.
After what happened, it can't be the same.
I'll give you a few minutes.
I have a question.
And you actually think I'm going to answer it?
Sarah Holt was protecting your mission.
All those innocent people you killed.
What kind of mission could ever justify that?
I'm sorry, Counsellor.
I'm going to hang on to that one.
It's because there was no mission.
Other than whatever crap it is you told Sarah.
All your loyal pack of mental cases.
Bottom line, Stack, you're just a greedy corporate shill
- who did it for the money.
- Careful, Mitch.
I'm a man with many friends.
Something Sarah forgot.
You're done.
Why, because I'm in prison?
So was Sarah.
And yet, somehow, her cell door opened at just the right time.
What makes you think that can't happen again?
Mr. McDeere, Mitch!
The US Attorney credits you for exposing the Noble conspiracy.
Exposing is one thing, proving it is another.
I ran your name through our archives, and there's a mention of a Mitch McDeere ten years ago.
You helped the FBI take out a mob law firm in Memphis.
So what's the deal here, is this what you do?
I'm sorry, we need to go.
Alex Clark made a prediction this morning.
She said the hard drive would be suppressed.
Alex Clark isn't known for her stellar judgement.
Are you worried she'll embarrass you on the stand?
Mr. McDeere, is this a possibility?
Kevin Stack killed over 100 people.
If he walks out today, the last thing the world should be worried about is my embarrassment.
Uh, excuse me - Mr. McDeere?
My name is Steven Hath.
This is my wife, Meredith.
This is my brother, Ray, and our associate, Tammy Hemphill.
We don't want to keep you.
We just, uh, wanted to say thanks.
Our son Daniel was one of the patients scheduled to be killed by Kevin Stack.
He has leukemia.
We just heard last month.
So thank you.
All of you.... for protecting what little time we have left with our son.
Thank you...
Please send your son our best.
- So sweet of you, thank you.
- Thank you for saying something.
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.
You McDeeres, I gotta give it to you.
When you steal a hard drive, you go all out.
I talked to my bosses, they're offering full immunity in exchange for your testimony against Stack and his people.
Though, I have to admit, they had to think about it.
We'll take the deal, Diane.
But forgive us if we don't act like you did us a favour.
It's been hard for you guys.
I get that.
But it won't get any easier in that courtroom.
Mitch... nervous?
- In a courtroom?
- No.
You must be.
I think I remember you saying you've never tried a case in court before.
Not quite.
Never tried a case in front of a jury.
I've done hundreds of hearings.
My cases never seem to last long enough to get to trial.
One of the partners at Kinross, Andrew Palmer, he told us about a secret room at Kinross.
- Objection, hearsay.
- Sustained.
Regardless of how you heard about the room, please tell the court how you obtained the hard drive.
We went to Kinross beforehand to assess the security.
You didn't just go to Kinross.... you and Ray wore a disguise.
Yes.
Because you intended to steal what you knew was private property.
You didn't want to be identified.
Okay, I suppose.
Tell us...
what was the disguise?
I was pretending to be a woman getting a divorce.
Ray was my attorney.
Brilliant.
We needed to get a key to the room, from Kevin Stack.
And so we came up with a way to get access without anybody getting hurt.
You exposed him to peanut oil because you knew he was severely allergic and would be instantly incapacitated.
- For a short while.
- You didn't know that.
He could have gone into anaphylactic shock.
- He could have died.
- That wasn't likely.
You recklessly risked his life to steal that drive.
That's reckless disregard for human life.
If he died, it would be murder.
We had a shot of epinephrine to prevent that.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize...
- Did you call an ambulance?
- No.
No?
Care to elaborate on that, Mr. McDeere?
I posed as a paramedic.
I kept my eye on him.
He was never in any danger.
I see.
Did you get a medical degree while you were serving time in prison for manslaughter?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
I have to say, Miss Ruckheiser... the level of deception here is concerning.
I agree, Your Honour, but it doesn't change the fact that law enforcement wasn't involved.
Oh, please.
You met with McDeere.
He asked you for a warrant.
You told him to get it himself.
We've been over this.
Your Honour, you see what this was.
A carefully-plotted and then executed scheme to steal private property that almost killed my client.
True.
But it also exposed him as a killer, so you'll forgive me if I pass on the moral outrage.
Your Honour, it's over 100 counts of murder.
I wish that made a difference.
My legal analysis of the search is the same, regardless of the number of victims.
If you suppress the drive, Your Honour,
I'd like my client released today.
File that under wishful thinking, Miss Clark.
I'll take the day to consider my ruling.
You'll have my decision in the morning.
Mr. McDeere... what you did saved a lot of lives.
As a human being, I thank you for that.
But as a judge,
I'm not sure the law can endorse it.
An early *** in the prosecution of former Noble vice president, Kevin Stack.
Judge Kirzan should take the bench shortly.
Her decision could very possibly end this case before it really begins.
A tough day yesterday on the stand for lawyer Mitchell McDeere and the other government witnesses.
What if we lose?
Forget the hard drive...
Why can't the government make their case another way?
They could try, but then they couldn't use any of the evidence they discovered from the hard drive.
Which would be pretty much everything.
Are you sure you don't want to come inside?
I'm not ready to see Stack yet.
But Claire and I are just fine out here.
I just wanted us all to be together when we win.
Is there anything more cowardly than hiring someone to kill?
Paying someone, or persuading someone to do the unspeakable while you wait for news that it's done?
Maybe one thing.
Hiding behind the law.
Hiring some mouthpiece to find a way out.
Making the law and the court your protector.
Let's be clear.
The evidence on this hard drive is staggering.
It proves beyond any doubt that this defendant is evil.
But is it admissible?
Miss Ruckheiser's right.
The Fourth Amendment doesn't exclude evidence provided to the government by a private citizen.
But what does that mean?
Is there no limit to what a private citizen can do to secure evidence?
I don't know where that line gets crossed, but surely, the conduct in this case comes close.
And, more troublingly, was Mr. McDeere acting as a private citizen when he hatched and executed this dangerous plan?
If an average citizen had met with Miss.
Ruckheiser,
I might feel differently.
But Mr. McDeere is far from that.
An experienced lawyer, he knew exactly what Miss Ruckheiser was saying.
Get us evidence.
This court finds that Mr. McDeere and his associates were, effectively, acting as agents of the government - the disguises, the peanut oil, all of it.
Shocks the conscience of the court.
The hard drive is excluded.
Miss Ruckheiser, I hope it's not all you've got, because, for now, Mr. Stack is free to go.
Mr. Stack!
Any comments for the press?
Mr. Stack!
Mr. Stack!
Mitch... a word.
We'll look, but without the drive, we may not have enough to re-charge.
Diane...
Abby...
How could this be possible, Lewis?
It doesn't have to be like this, Abby.
We can arrest him for what he did to you, but you have to testify.
Stack was there, wasn't he - you saw him give the order.
I saw him doing more than that, [whispers] Andrew...
Wait a minute.
Diane, we need to talk...
Like I said, I have friends everywhere.
Kevin Stack.
I'm arresting you for the murder of Andrew Palmer.
You can't be serious!
Another charge you can't possibly prove.
We'll see.
I have a feeling this one might stick.
We have a witness who saw you give the order.
Let's go.
I didn't know you had a case for Andrew.
I didn't know we had a witness.
Who?
Me.
Previously on The Firm
Mitch took the drive.
I don't know where, and neither does she.
And since you don't know where to find the drive,
I don't need you anymore.
Let's make a deal.
At 2100 hours, you will drive to Dulles Airport Access Road and you will wait for further instructions.
I don't care about the drive, I just want Abby.
McDeere's wife doesn't know where the drive is.
How do you know?
Let's just say we asked her in a way that encouraged the truth.
You tortured her
- Stack?
- I told you to come alone.
You're under arrest as a material witness in an FBI investigation.
If a judge rules he's not a material witness, the FBI have no right to search the drive.
Then get McDeere out, and get us that drive.
Cuff yourselves.
I've known Abby longer than I've known my own wife.
You just find Abby.
- You're in federal custody.
- Not anymore.
I got out, and we got the drive.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do -
No, hey, you listen to me!
Meet me at the park near Grace Church on the south side of the street.
It's the only option we have at this point.
Wait 'til we make contact.
When I give the order, drive her in.
- Do you have the drive?
- Where's Abby?
Close.
You know, I have to say
I underestimated what you and your family are capable of.
When Sarah violated protocol, asked the court to assign her a lawyer,
I guess it was bad luck for both of us.
You win, Stack.
I just want my wife back.
It's not about winning, it's about shifting the balance.
I don't give a damn about your mission.
Show me my wife, or I will walk away right now.
You know, we're not too different, you and I.
We make choices everyday - which client to fight for... which ones you can't save...
- You and I are nothing alike.
- Don't be too sure.
It's easy to think of me as a monster.
Killing.
People can't look past it.
That's something you learn to get over as a soldier;
People die.
And no amount of wasted money or tears can stop it.
Drive her in.
- I need to see her.
- Not possible.
You chose this place,
I can't drag her out in front of everyone.
When I get the drive, my men in the car will walk away.
How do I know that that's Abby?
How do I know it's the real drive?
It seems we've come to the point where we're just going to have to trust each other.
Excuse me...
Uh, I like your camera.
I've been thinking about getting one of those.
You should.
You mind if I take a look?
Sure.
Great, thanks.
My people won't be patient much longer.
Do we have a deal?
Thank you.
Where are you going?
McDeere!
You do not want to test me!
- What happened?
- It's not her.
What - how do you know?
Because I can see it wasn't her wedding ring.
It's not her.
It's a set-up.
Look, are you sure?
We're not getting a second chance.
It's not her.
He didn't bring her.
Why wouldn't he bring her?
If she was alive, he would have let us see her.
You...
You don't know that.
She's dead.
He killed her.
He never planned to let us see her.
I have to talk to Claire, I have to see Claire.
I did this.
It's my fault!
Hey, you didn't do anything!
We were all in this, right from the start!
We all go wrapped up in it.
And it's not over yet.
Stack's crazy, and if that wasn't Abby in the car, he's comin' after us now.
Mitch, we can find her.
FBI's gonna help us.
Come on, get in the car.
I don't have the drive.
McDeere wouldn't give it up.
You're a persuasive guy, Kevin.
How's that possible?
- He demanded to see his wife.
- And?
And I couldn't make that happen.
- The situation went bad.
- Bad how?
You know what - don't tell me.
It doesn't matter now.
If McDeere gives the real drive to the feds, nothing we do is going to matter!
My thoughts exactly.
But every mission comes to an end.
The safe play now is to eject.
You're leaving?
Doesn't have to be alone.
Emotion's not my strong point, Alex, but the truth is, I've come to... care about you and what we have.
Kevin...
I've made arrangements at the airport.
I can have someone pick you up.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
You know how I feel, but my life is here.
My firm...
The FBI will come at you.
I'm ready for that.
Nothing they have connects to me.
I made sure the trail ends with the other 3 partners that are involved.
I expected as much.
Goodbye, Alex.
Like hell it's over.
This won't be over until you charge him with obstructing justice.
You keep pointing that finger at me, it's going to be obstructing your windpipe.
He's angry, Lewis.
I'm angry.
I went after McDeere to make a point.
We all need to trust the system.
I have zero tolerance for cowboys.
I didn't think I had to make that point to you.
It's his wife, Diane.
The system can take a backseat for a minute.
You hear this?
I'm arresting him right now.
It won't stick!
I signed the McDeeres out for a debriefing and they overpowered me.
You don't even know where they are.
You don't even know if they're still in the city.
Miss.
Ruckheiser...
Mitch and Ray McDeere are here to see you.
Here?
Yes, ma'am.
They're in the lobby with a nervous Russian.
We didn't get her - Stack still has Abby.
Do you have any idea where he's holding her?
Did he give you any clue?
We don't even know if she's alive.
Look, you have to help us!
There is a drive in there that we got from Stack.
Now on it is information that proves that he's killing Noble Insurance patients.
It's encrypted.
It's military grade.
I got close, but I couldn't access the full key.
Who the hell is this guy?
Dimitri Portnoy, a friend from my days at Brushy Mountain.
He's been helping us out.
Unofficially...
I'm on parole.
I'm not supposed to touch computers.
Wayne, take Mr. Portnoy and the drive to the techs.
Mr. Portnoy, if you can speed up our access,
I'll personally take care of your parole.
What about Abby?
What are you gonna do for her?
Mitch... we've got most of my people on it.
I'm gonna go see where they're at.
We're ready, Diane.
You have to hear the whole story.
Lewis Coleman.
Marshall Coleman, this is Officer Ford, DC Police.
I'm out in the seventh district.
I'm calling about a woman named Abby McDeere...
She's been found.
Her body's been found?
Oh no, Marshall...
I mean yes, but not like that.
She's alive.
She was picked up by a passing motorist.
Obviously been through a lot of trauma.
She won't say much.
Seems to be in some kind of shock.
I ran her prints and got an alert to notify you.
Can you put her on, please?
I can try.
We're gonna take her to the hospital...
Get her looked at.
That's when the court appointed Sarah's case to me.
Now she was supposed to call Stack.
But she broke protocol.
Sarah admitted that?
We found her!
Mitch...
It's Abby.
- Abby?
- Mitch?
Oh, God, I thought I lost you.
Are you okay?
I love you.
We had to give her a sedative.
She should be fine.
So she's not hurt?
It's hard to know what we're dealing with.
There are no apparent injuries, but her anxietal level is so high, it's affecting her vitals.
- Like a panic attack?
- Yeah, exhaustion, anxiety...
I don't know what she went through, but whatever it was, it took an emotional toll.
We'll keep her for now, see how she does.
Thank you.
Not injured.
Yeah, but something happened to her.
And how did she get away?
I don't know, I guess we'll figure that out.
Claire...
Your mom's gonna be okay.
They've just given her something to sleep.
What happened to her?
They don't know.
They're gonna keep her here overnight, and just make sure that everything's fine.
So what about the hard drive?
Feds have it, they're crackin' it now.
- And Stack?
- We left him at Grace Park.
I hear Abby's doing well.
Here it comes.
Here what comes?
You always want something, Tarrance.
You don't have to feign interest in Abby.
Just get on with it.
Our techs are cracking the drive.
Dimitri's been a big help, but we could use you there to put the evidence into context.
- How long do you need?
- A couple hours.
You'd be back before Abby's up.
Just go, honey.
We'll stay here in case she wakes up.
The agents are with us, and you and Ray should finish it.
It's not gonna be over until Alex and Stack are convicted.
The hard drive contains 3 discrete files.
The first has a formula:
patient's name, medical condition, are entered here.
That triggers a number of input fields.
Formal diagnosis, prescriptions...
Age, family history, prior surgery.
Right, so the first part gives you a clear picture of the patient's condition.
Then it calculates life expectancy.
You can see here, this patient was expected to live for another 17 months.
And that file cross-references with the cost?
Stack has been doing the math, seeing who costs the company the most.
Right, then they assign the patient a number.
More money they cost, the higher the number.
And that's how Stack chooses who to kill.
Now, the second file seems to be a database of victims.
They're all Noble patients, all diagnosed with terminal conditions.
- Any patterns?
- Not really.
Male, female, as young as 20, as old as 98.
Homes, hospices...
That's Margaret Whittaker, the woman that Sarah murdered.
Can we see that one?
Looks like she was projected to cost the company two million over the next fourteen months.
Wow.
How many victims in total?
Well, the hard drive has 117 patients that we can't confirm are dead,
Well, the hard drive but it looks that way.
But there are another 46 that were scheduled for termination.
Thanks to you guys, they're now under our protection.
What about the third file on the drive?
Those are Stack's people.
Sarah is one of them
- Any names?
- No, just numbers
Probably people Stack knew from his days in the army.
We're that.
And Stack?
Alex Clark?
Those arrests are happening as we speak.
Before the deposition, let's get emails, texts, everything that predates the contract.
I'm sorry, what exactly is going on here?
- Alex Clark?
- Yes.
We need you to come with us.
Hands behind your back, please.
What is this about?
It's fine, I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
117 counts of murder?
One hell of a misunderstanding.
Excuse me...
You can't -
We don't have him.
Track his cell, credit cards, everything!
Get his face up at the airports.
What about the flight plan?
I don't give a damn.
Just file it.
Where to, Major?
Warfield.
We need a private air strip.
I can arrange for the equipment.
Negative, Sergeant.
Everything's arranged.
I've known this day might come for quite a while.
Is the mission over, sir?
Are we standing down?
Kevin Stack.
The FBI just left your office.
Good thing I wasn't in it.
Hardly a time for jokes.
Can I assume this precious mission of yours is blown?
Looks that way.
Then you need to come in.
We need to know what we're dealing with here.
That's not a good idea.
Your judgement, Kevin, as to what constitutes a good idea at this point is worth less than nothing.
Now if you intend to disappear and leave us holding a bag of federal questions, you will at least come in and help us answer them before you go.
You're a smart guy, Allard, you'll think of something.
Oh, I am a smart guy, Kevin.
And a connected one.
Now you either come here now, or we'll come get you.
And whoever we send will not be in as good a mood as I am now.
Where?
I'm still at the Washington Hilton, the Presidential suite.
If the feds are looking for me, I'm not walking into the Hilton.
Go in the back.
You'll find a freight elevator just past the massive kitchen.
Next time you threaten me, Allard,
I will not be in as good a mood as I am now.
Look at you.
All your power.
You ever fight for anything, Allard?
You ever care about anything other than money?
Agent Tarrance!
You didn't.
If I go down, so do you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Agent Tarrance, this company will do everything in its power to help your investigation.
Kevin Stack, you're under arrest for the murder of...
Ah, hell, maybe I should list the people you didn't murder.
It might take less time.
Abby was picked up on the road about 200 yards north.
She must have been making a run for it.
Building's been abandoned for years.
This must be where Stack had her taken for questioning.
So who's this guy?
Maybe the guy that was asking the questions.
You think Abby did this?
We'll have to ask.
You know what this is for...
Not something you see everyday.
Waterboarding a civilian - A schoolteacher.
Yeah, well, Stack's military.
His guys are ex-army.
They did waterboard tests on CIA operatives.
The average agent could only hold back the truth for 16 seconds.
My God.
Can you just imagine what she went through?
Hey...
How you doing?
I'm right here.
Everyone's here.
Claire?
She's just down the hall with Ray and Tammy.
We've been rotating.
We didn't want you to get overwhelmed.
I'm...
I'm okay.
I'm so sorry, Abby.
You want to tell me what happened?
Where you were?
What they did to you?
It's okay, you don't have to talk about it.
You can tell me when you're ready.
Stack?
He's been arrested.
It's over, Abby.
The feds, they have the drive.
They know everything.
Andrew's dead.
The police found his body in the river.
What about Alex?
She was also arrested.
The US Attorney picked her up today at the office.
Good.
It's your choice, Miss.
Clark.
You can continue to deny involvement -
You mean tell the truth?
And take your chances, but... lawyer to lawyer, you have my word:
When we prove you guilty, this office will have no mercy for you.
Lawyer to lawyer -
Last time I checked, you can prove a case without evidence.
We'll get it.
We arrested Kevin Stack.
He might have a lot to say about the lawyer who failed to keep him out of prison.
Somehow I doubt it.
And I'm innocent, so anything he did say would be a lie.
You knew Kevin Stack was terminating Noble patients.
You knew Sarah Holt was a hired killer.
You pressured Andrew Palmer to bring Mitch McDeere in-house as a way to control Sarah's case.
How does this work, Diane?
You just keep listing things you think I did, and then, what - I break down and confess?
Here's my confession:
I was terribly naive.
Apparently Stack was working with some of my colleagues behind my back.
Andrew Palmer is probably the ringleader.
Our records show that he set up some secret room at the firm for Stack to keep files.
But you knew nothing about that?
No.
We preserved those files for your review.
They connect Stack to several other attorneys at Kinross, but not me.
We also found proof of payment made to those lawyers by Noble Insurance.
Very neat and clean.
My office will also send over a log for the those who accessed the room.
Proves I was never inside.
Before his death,
Andrew Palmer made it clear that you were helping Kevin Stack.
Really...
Well, that sounds like...
What's the word...
Hearsay.
If you say so.
You're the trial lawyer.
You killed a lot of people, Alex.
Not just Kevin Stack, not just his loyal soldiers.
You.
And you will go down for your part in this.
I'm just getting started.
Shot in the dark here, but I'm guessing Yale law.
That's right.
Makes sense.
You Yalies are so conceptual.
No time for practical realities like facts.
I'm a Georgetown gal.
A bulldog, just like your boss, Frank Shore.
We're old friends.
You don't have enough to charge me and you know it.
Even worse, I know it.
So... maybe we can cut the rest of our little chat short.
Hm?
You can't release her!
I don't want to release her, Mitch, but she's right.
We don't have enough to charge.
I can testify.
To what?
She didn't choose which victims to kill, she didn't do the killing.
She is Stack's partner!
She is equally responsible, and you know it.
Yeah, I do know that.
And I just told Alex I wouldn't rest until the day I could prove it.
But, sadly, that day is not today.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
This thing is really blowing up.
117 counts of murder, that gets some attention around here.
Diane, we have to talk about this.
We're arresting 3 other lawyers at Kinross, our agents are picking them up right now.
And they would not help Stack without Alex's blessing.
We'll talk later.
Between Stack, his soldiers, and three lawyers, we have enough to focus on.
They're not charging Alex?
Can you change it?
Can you convince her?
Well, we could try and go over her head...
You talk to her.
You said Diane was smart.
If there's a way, she'll get on board.
Mitch... we cannot let her get away with what she did.
To us.
You going down?
There she is.
It's good to see you up.
A few days ago it was you in here.
Did I miss Mitch?
Yeah, he went to see Diane Ruckheiser.
She released Alex.
Ray and Tammy are just in the waiting room.
They could fill you in on the gaps, if that's what you need.
No, no.
Actually, I came to see you.
We found the room where you were being held.
So you know what else we found.
And who else we found.
I assume that you did what was necessary to get away.
There won't be an investigation.
It's closed.
Now, the water and the white cloth...
Were they used?
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry, Abby.
I know guys who've been through that.
And it stayed with them for a long time.
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe.
Have you told the doctors?
Have you told Mitch?
You need to tell him.
Not yet.
You can't get out the other side of this without the people that you love.
You need to tell Mitch.
I'll tell him when I'm ready.
You promise me.
Lewis...
I need to tell him in my own time.
I'm on your side, Mitch.
You may not believe that, but it's true.
Then why don't you start acting like it, Diane.
Alex Clark is guilty.
I don't care if you have sufficient evidence.
The feds hold people all the time without proof!
You practically made it an art form!
Hey!
What is going on with you?
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not anything close to fine.
You're a wreck.
You want to pick a fight with me, you can.
Will it change anything?
It won't.
You got yourself into a mess, Mitch.
And it's not going away.
So you can stand here and yell at me, or go help your family start moving forward.
Might be easier to yell at you.
I'm sure.
It's okay, Mitch.
Maybe not today...
But it will be.
Okay, sit here.
We've got a blanket, pillows from upstairs, remote, tissues...
Fantastic.
Anything you need, just tell me and I'll get it.
Ah, I like this.
I should get sick more often.
I'm sorry, Claire.
It's okay.
So am I.
- For what?
- Everything.
We were okay in the program.
I didn't hate it.
Why would you say that?
Well, I just mean...
I know we left because you guys wanted me to have a normal life.
You listen, we left because we all wanted to have a normal life.
You have nothing to feel guilty about, do you hear me?
Yeah.
- I like your hair.
- Thanks.
Tammy did it.
Socks...
I'll get your fuzzy ones.
There you go.
Do you want anything else?
I think Claire's got it under control.
How you feeling?
I just need to sit here for a while.
You going to Stack's arraignment?
I don't have to.
No, you should go.
If you wanted to talk...
I still don't know what happened.
I told you, we'll talk about it when I'm ready.
I know, but it's just, I...
Babe, it's me.
What's goin' on?
Mitch, I can't help you with this right now.
- What does that mean?
- It means...
It means you should go to the arraignment.
117 counts of murder.
That's what they're investigating.
Today, they'll charge a much lower amount.
Maybe ten or 20.
We also just got notice that the US Attorney may decide to pursue the death penalty.
They won't follow through with it.
They'll offer life without parole to avoid a trial.
Doesn't matter if it's true, Kevin.
It's enough that it's even a possibility.
What now?
It doesn't look good.
We knew what would happen if the feds got the drive.
Who do they have?
They're putting names to the faces of your people.
They're focused on finding the actual killers.
They also arrested the three partners at Kinross.
But not you.
They tried.
I was ready.
The other partners could talk, put you at the centre.
Just words.
They won't be able to prove the connection.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
I tried to protect you and the company but it just wasn't possible.
That doesn't work for me.
I brought you in to handle this.
And that's what I expect to happen.
I wish I could, but you knew the risk.
Listen to me.
You will figure this out.
You will find a way to get me out of here.
Or what?
Or you're going down with the rest of us.
Here's some new information for you, Alex.
I recorded every conversation you and I ever had about this mission of ours.
- That's not true.
- Doesn't matter if it's true.
It's enough that it's even a possibility.
It's conflict for me to represent you.
I'll waive any conflict.
It's worth it to me to have a lawyer so motivated.
Calling CR-12461.
United States vs. Kevin Stack.
Defendant is charged with 15 counts of murder.
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
We're only charging 15, but the FBI is investigating over 100 suspected killings.
Order.
Quiet!
I'm only going to say this once.
If the gallery, including the members of the press, disrupt this process again.
Alex Clark for the defendant.
Waive reading of the rights and charges.
So waived.
Mr. Stack, how do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honour.
Your Honour, my office is investigating
Miss.
Clark's role in this enterprise.
We object to her serving as counsel.
Any conflict's been waived by my client, Your Honour.
And if Diane had anything real,
I'd be waiting for my arraignment.
She's right, Miss Ruckheiser,
I can't exclude her because you think she's involved.
The defendant is held without bail.
- Any motions?
- Yes, Your Honour.
The defence will be moving to suppress the hard drive taken from my client.
On what grounds?
On the grounds that it was stolen.
We don't know anything about that.
The drive was provided to us by a private citizen.
- The Fourth Amendment?
- The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure by law enforcement.
We're allowed to use evidence turned in by private citizens.
Unless those private citizens are acting as agents of the police.
You met with Mitch McDeere.
He asked you to start an investigation.
You told him to come back with hard evidence.
I never encouraged any illegal activity.
You couldn't get a warrant for the drive, so you instructed him to do what you couldn't do yourself.
Oh, I won't stand here and listen to this.
Your Honour, this man and those loyal to him killed over 100 people.
We are talking about one of the most vile, mass murderers in modern criminal history.
I want a hearing.
My client was almost killed by Mitch McDeere and his brother, a convicted felon.
- Are we done?
- We are done.
For today.
But I'm granting the hearing.
Your Honour...
It's 100 murders, Miss Ruckheiser.
All hinging on one key piece of evidence.
Any judge would look at the circumstances.
If you didn't blow it, you'll be fine.
What the hell did they do to you, Abbs?
They wanted the hard drive, and they thought I knew where it was.
And they forced you to tell them?
I told them about Dimitri.
But I didn't know where he lived.
I tried to lie, but... they do it so that you think you're drowning.
Oh God.
Does Mitch know?
Honestly, Tammy, when I see him, the things I want to say to him...
It's better that I don't.
These things that happen to us, they're not just bad luck.
He looks for them.
He finds them, and then he refuses to walk away.
You really think that?
He talks about being a big lawyer, about all that potential being taken away, but he's just scared.
What if he's not that great?
Well, this way, he never has to find out.
Big future interrupted again.
Honey, you're angry.
That's understandable.
I'm not just angry, Tammy.
I'm...
I'm different.
After what happened, it can't be the same.
I'll give you a few minutes.
I have a question.
And you actually think I'm going to answer it?
Sarah Holt was protecting your mission.
All those innocent people you killed.
What kind of mission could ever justify that?
I'm sorry, Counsellor.
I'm going to hang on to that one.
It's because there was no mission.
Other than whatever crap it is you told Sarah.
All your loyal pack of mental cases.
Bottom line, Stack, you're just a greedy corporate shill
- who did it for the money.
- Careful, Mitch.
I'm a man with many friends.
Something Sarah forgot.
You're done.
Why, because I'm in prison?
So was Sarah.
And yet, somehow, her cell door opened at just the right time.
What makes you think that can't happen again?
Mr. McDeere, Mitch!
The US Attorney credits you for exposing the Noble conspiracy.
Exposing is one thing, proving it is another.
I ran your name through our archives, and there's a mention of a Mitch McDeere ten years ago.
You helped the FBI take out a mob law firm in Memphis.
So what's the deal here, is this what you do?
I'm sorry, we need to go.
Alex Clark made a prediction this morning.
She said the hard drive would be suppressed.
Alex Clark isn't known for her stellar judgement.
Are you worried she'll embarrass you on the stand?
Mr. McDeere, is this a possibility?
Kevin Stack killed over 100 people.
If he walks out today, the last thing the world should be worried about is my embarrassment.
Uh, excuse me - Mr. McDeere?
My name is Steven Hath.
This is my wife, Meredith.
This is my brother, Ray, and our associate, Tammy Hemphill.
We don't want to keep you.
We just, uh, wanted to say thanks.
Our son Daniel was one of the patients scheduled to be killed by Kevin Stack.
He has leukemia.
We just heard last month.
So thank you.
All of you.... for protecting what little time we have left with our son.
Thank you...
Please send your son our best.
- So sweet of you, thank you.
- Thank you for saying something.
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.
You McDeeres, I gotta give it to you.
When you steal a hard drive, you go all out.
I talked to my bosses, they're offering full immunity in exchange for your testimony against Stack and his people.
Though, I have to admit, they had to think about it.
We'll take the deal, Diane.
But forgive us if we don't act like you did us a favour.
It's been hard for you guys.
I get that.
But it won't get any easier in that courtroom.
Mitch... nervous?
- In a courtroom?
- No.
You must be.
I think I remember you saying you've never tried a case in court before.
Not quite.
Never tried a case in front of a jury.
I've done hundreds of hearings.
My cases never seem to last long enough to get to trial.
One of the partners at Kinross, Andrew Palmer, he told us about a secret room at Kinross.
- Objection, hearsay.
- Sustained.
Regardless of how you heard about the room, please tell the court how you obtained the hard drive.
We went to Kinross beforehand to assess the security.
You didn't just go to Kinross.... you and Ray wore a disguise.
Yes.
Because you intended to steal what you knew was private property.
You didn't want to be identified.
Okay, I suppose.
Tell us...
what was the disguise?
I was pretending to be a woman getting a divorce.
Ray was my attorney.
Brilliant.
We needed to get a key to the room, from Kevin Stack.
And so we came up with a way to get access without anybody getting hurt.
You exposed him to peanut oil because you knew he was severely allergic and would be instantly incapacitated.
- For a short while.
- You didn't know that.
He could have gone into anaphylactic shock.
- He could have died.
- That wasn't likely.
You recklessly risked his life to steal that drive.
That's reckless disregard for human life.
If he died, it would be murder.
We had a shot of epinephrine to prevent that.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize...
- Did you call an ambulance?
- No.
No?
Care to elaborate on that, Mr. McDeere?
I posed as a paramedic.
I kept my eye on him.
He was never in any danger.
I see.
Did you get a medical degree while you were serving time in prison for manslaughter?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
I have to say, Miss Ruckheiser... the level of deception here is concerning.
I agree, Your Honour, but it doesn't change the fact that law enforcement wasn't involved.
Oh, please.
You met with McDeere.
He asked you for a warrant.
You told him to get it himself.
We've been over this.
Your Honour, you see what this was.
A carefully-plotted and then executed scheme to steal private property that almost killed my client.
True.
But it also exposed him as a killer, so you'll forgive me if I pass on the moral outrage.
Your Honour, it's over 100 counts of murder.
I wish that made a difference.
My legal analysis of the search is the same, regardless of the number of victims.
If you suppress the drive, Your Honour,
I'd like my client released today.
File that under wishful thinking, Miss Clark.
I'll take the day to consider my ruling.
You'll have my decision in the morning.
Mr. McDeere... what you did saved a lot of lives.
As a human being, I thank you for that.
But as a judge,
I'm not sure the law can endorse it.
An early *** in the prosecution of former Noble vice president, Kevin Stack.
Judge Kirzan should take the bench shortly.
Her decision could very possibly end this case before it really begins.
A tough day yesterday on the stand for lawyer Mitchell McDeere and the other government witnesses.
What if we lose?
Forget the hard drive...
Why can't the government make their case another way?
They could try, but then they couldn't use any of the evidence they discovered from the hard drive.
Which would be pretty much everything.
Are you sure you don't want to come inside?
I'm not ready to see Stack yet.
But Claire and I are just fine out here.
I just wanted us all to be together when we win.
Is there anything more cowardly than hiring someone to kill?
Paying someone, or persuading someone to do the unspeakable while you wait for news that it's done?
Maybe one thing.
Hiding behind the law.
Hiring some mouthpiece to find a way out.
Making the law and the court your protector.
Let's be clear.
The evidence on this hard drive is staggering.
It proves beyond any doubt that this defendant is evil.
But is it admissible?
Miss Ruckheiser's right.
The Fourth Amendment doesn't exclude evidence provided to the government by a private citizen.
But what does that mean?
Is there no limit to what a private citizen can do to secure evidence?
I don't know where that line gets crossed, but surely, the conduct in this case comes close.
And, more troublingly, was Mr. McDeere acting as a private citizen when he hatched and executed this dangerous plan?
If an average citizen had met with Miss.
Ruckheiser,
I might feel differently.
But Mr. McDeere is far from that.
An experienced lawyer, he knew exactly what Miss Ruckheiser was saying.
Get us evidence.
This court finds that Mr. McDeere and his associates were, effectively, acting as agents of the government - the disguises, the peanut oil, all of it.
Shocks the conscience of the court.
The hard drive is excluded.
Miss Ruckheiser, I hope it's not all you've got, because, for now, Mr. Stack is free to go.
Mr. Stack!
Any comments for the press?
Mr. Stack!
Mr. Stack!
Mitch... a word.
We'll look, but without the drive, we may not have enough to re-charge.
Diane...
Abby...
How could this be possible, Lewis?
It doesn't have to be like this, Abby.
We can arrest him for what he did to you, but you have to testify.
Stack was there, wasn't he - you saw him give the order.
I saw him doing more than that, [whispers] Andrew...
Wait a minute.
Diane, we need to talk...
Like I said, I have friends everywhere.
Kevin Stack.
I'm arresting you for the murder of Andrew Palmer.
You can't be serious!
Another charge you can't possibly prove.
We'll see.
I have a feeling this one might stick.
We have a witness who saw you give the order.
Let's go.
I didn't know you had a case for Andrew.
I didn't know we had a witness.
Who?
Me.
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola-- handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys
- that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.
Oh, that's her.
It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
- Oh.
- Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
- Come on, Cece, you know how to do this.
- Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug balls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
- All right.
- Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball?
- Dad.
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ ♪ It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...
- No...
- sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
I don't...
Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap-- crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess.
Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Are you...?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
- Okay.
- He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went Legoltod with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides
I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho!
Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one-- you know the rule.
- Ah!
Look at that right there.
- That's...
Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
Okay.
- I, uh,
I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
Hey, Dad,
- you want to help us?
- I have to stay away from salmonella.
You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says...
It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you,
- but it's been months.
- Jess.
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry, I thought,
I thought, I-
- I'm s-- I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram-- all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me...
Salmonella...
- Salmonella.
- Okay.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song, huh?
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.
- Great night.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after-- the afterparty.
- The afterparty.
- The after-- yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan:
We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap-- there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap;
- They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me.
I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular.
Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
- The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.
- Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...
Dead.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell-- dead.
Dead.
You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us,
- I mean, the voice of the NFL-- Steve Sabol?
Dead.
- Also dead.
- Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius.
All you got to do is
- follow the money.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
Yeah, it's my plan B.
Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between... whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the...
Carol is not a zombie?
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight thing where...
It's not like the Twilight...
No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't really...
you don't get it.
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight, that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
- It's the same as Twilight...
- Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen,
I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth--
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
- Go hit on her.
- What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her...
- Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't hit on...
- Hey, Mom.
Mom, uh,
- Jess...
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
I like your de, uh... your de... de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives,
Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two...
No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey!
All right.
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- All day.
I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!
Why are you yelling at me?
I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!
Joan, I've got to say you are great... at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
- You want to give it a try?
- Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- Well, no, no, no...
- Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
- What?
Dad...
- Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously,
I'm not...
Okay.
Fine, you're right.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick.
♪ Every time I try to tell you ♪
♪ The words just come out wrong ♪
Nick!
♪ So I have to say "I love you" ♪
♪ In a song.
- Nick!
- I love that.
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
!
- I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...
Nick, this is not what we talked about.
- I know but it got...
- Give me that baster.
- No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot?
What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation,
- Ha!
- And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade-- it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
- He is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What?
What are you saying?
- What?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything...
- Anything, - 'cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not... you don't have any information
- about anything.
- Information at all.
Nothing.
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.
- What?
- Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt.
I mean...
- No.
We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
- Winston.
Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston...
Everybody else really hot, too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
Ooh!
Thank you.
- Manly.
- Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
- Okay?
For you to have.
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take... that's right...
What are we having here, turkey sushi?
What is this?
Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins!
Yes!
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
!
- What?
- In conclusion...
I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said...
it couldn't be done.
They said,
"You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
- Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait.
What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it
- in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day
- of my entire life.
- Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex.
Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
You lit this place on fire,
- you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.
Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs,
- I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.
- You can't volunteer right after...
- I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.
- Joanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.
I saw something.
You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural.
Bring it to you.
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious.
No.
What?
Let me finish.
Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
- You have to admit that...
- No.
- What?
...
- they're never gonna make it work.
- No.
- And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Honey, are you an addict?
Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes.
What, are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
- Are you into pot?
Is this a rehab?
- What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
When can we start eating?
It's off.
Off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
- Honey?
- Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess.
Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't, 'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just...
I thought... maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that... since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
- Not for me.
- Hmm.
All right.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
- Yeah.
- I know, right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
All day!
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
I'm...
You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay...
Schmidt?
Yes...
I am...
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that
I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again-
- I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're done with those.
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola...
handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys
- that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.
Oh, that's her.
It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
- Oh.
- Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
- Come on, Cece, you know how to do this.
- Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug balls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
- All right.
- Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball?
- Dad.
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
* Who's that girl?
* Who's that girl?
* * It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...
- No...
- sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
I don't...
Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap... crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess.
Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Are you...?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
- Okay.
- He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went Legoltod with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides
I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho!
Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one...
you know the rule.
- Ah!
Look at that right there.
- That's...
Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
Okay.
- I, uh,
I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
Hey, Dad,
- you want to help us?
- I have to stay away from salmonella.
You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says...
It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you,
- but it's been months.
- Jess.
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry, I thought,
I thought, I...
I'm s...
I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram... all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me...
Salmonella...
- Salmonella.
- Okay.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song, huh?
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.
- Great night.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after...
the afterparty.
- The afterparty.
- The after... yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan:
We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap...
there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap;
- They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me.
I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular.
Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
- The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.
- Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...
Dead.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell... dead.
Dead.
You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us,
- I mean, the voice of the NFL...
Steve Sabol?
Dead.
- Also dead.
- Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius.
All you got to do is
- follow the money.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
Yeah, it's my plan B.
Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between... whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the...
Carol is not a zombie?
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight thing where...
It's not like the Twilight...
No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't really...
you don't get it.
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight, that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
- It's the same as Twilight...
- Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen,
I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth...
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
- Go hit on her.
- What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her...
- Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't hit on...
- Hey, Mom.
Mom, uh,
- Jess...
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
I like your de, uh... your de... de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives,
Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two...
No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey!
All right.
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- All day.
I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!
Why are you yelling at me?
I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!
Joan, I've got to say you are great... at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
- You want to give it a try?
- Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- Well, no, no, no...
- Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
- What?
Dad...
- Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously,
I'm not...
Okay.
Fine, you're right.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick.
* Every time I try to tell you *
* The words just come out wrong *
Nick!
* So I have to say "I love you" *
* In a song.
- Nick!
- I love that.
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
!
- I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...
Nick, this is not what we talked about.
- I know but it got...
- Give me that baster.
- No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot?
What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation,
- Ha!
- And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade...
it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
- He is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What?
What are you saying?
- What?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything...
- Anything, - 'cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not... you don't have any information
- about anything.
- Information at all.
Nothing.
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.
- What?
- Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt.
I mean...
- No.
We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
- Winston.
Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston...
Everybody else really hot, too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
Ooh!
Thank you.
- Manly.
- Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
- Okay?
For you to have.
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take... that's right...
What are we having here, turkey sushi?
What is this?
Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins!
Yes!
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
!
- What?
- In conclusion...
I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said...
it couldn't be done.
They said,
"You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
- Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait.
What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it
- in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day
- of my entire life.
- Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex.
Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
You lit this place on fire,
- you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.
Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs,
- I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.
- You can't volunteer right after...
- I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.
- Joanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.
I saw something.
You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural.
Bring it to you.
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious.
No.
What?
Let me finish.
Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
- You have to admit that...
- No.
- What?
...
- they're never gonna make it work.
- No.
- And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Honey, are you an addict?
Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes.
What, are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
- Are you into pot?
Is this a rehab?
- What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
When can we start eating?
It's off.
Off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
- Honey?
- Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess.
Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't, 'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just...
I thought... maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that... since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
- Not for me.
- Hmm.
All right.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
- Yeah.
- I know, right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
All day!
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
I'm...
You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay...
Schmidt?
Yes...
I am...
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that
I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again...
I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're done with those.
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
(Indistinct chatter)
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola-- handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
WINSTON:
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
CECE:
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
JESS:
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys
- that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have. (Knocking)
Oh, that's her.
It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
- Oh.
- Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
- Come on, Cece, you know how to do this.
- Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug balls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
- All right.
- Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball?
JESS:
Dad.
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ ♪ It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
JOAN:
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...
- No...
- sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
(Elevator bell dings)
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
I don't...
Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap-- crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess.
Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Are you...?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
(Sighs)
WINSTON:
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
(Laughs)
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
- Okay.
- He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went Legoltod with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides
I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho!
Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one-- you know the rule.
- Ah!
Look at that right there.
- That's...
Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
- (Laughing):
Okay.
- I, uh,
I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
(Laughs)
Hey, Dad,
- you want to help us?
- I have to stay away from salmonella.
(Scoffs) You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says...
It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you,
- but it's been months.
- Jess.
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry, I thought,
I thought, I-
- I'm s-- I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram-- all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
(Sighs)
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
JOAN:
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
JOAN:
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me...
Salmonella...
- Salmonella.
- Okay.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.
("It Doesn't Have to Be That Way" by Jim Croce playing)
Hey, remember that song, huh?
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.
- Great night.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after-- the afterparty.
- The afterparty.
- The after-- yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan:
We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap-- there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap;
- They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me.
I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
(Laughs)
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular.
Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
- The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
CECE:
What are you doing?
- I'm bored.
- Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...
BOTH:
Dead.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell-- dead.
Dead.
You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us,
- I mean, the voice of the NFL-- Steve Sabol?
Dead.
- Also dead.
- Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius.
All you got to do is
- follow the money.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
BOTH:
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
(Mouths)
Yeah, it's my plan B.
Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between... whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the...
Carol is not a zombie?
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight thing where...
It's not like the Twilight...
No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't really...
you don't get it.
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight, that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
- It's the same as Twilight...
- Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen,
I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth--
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
♪
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
(Clicks tongue)
- Go hit on her.
- What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her...
- Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't hit on...
- Hey, Mom.
Mom, uh,
- Jess...
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
(Clears throat)
I like your de, uh... your de... de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives,
Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
(Both grunting)
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
(Scoffs) Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two...
No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey!
All right.
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- All day.
I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!
Why are you yelling at me?
I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!
NICK:
Joan, I've got to say you are great... at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
- You want to give it a try?
- Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- Well, no, no, no...
- Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
(Giggling) Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
- What?
Dad...
- Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously,
I'm not...
Okay.
Fine, you're right.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick.
♪ Every time I try to tell you ♪
♪ The words just come out wrong ♪
Nick!
BOTH: ♪ So I have to say "I love you" ♪
♪ In a song.
- Nick!
- I love that.
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
!
- I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...
Nick, this is not what we talked about.
- I know but it got...
- Give me that baster.
JOAN:
No!
(Nick and Jess yell)
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot?
What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
(Grunts)
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
(Grunts)
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation,
- Ha!
- And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
(Knife tapping rapidly)
Don't touch the blade-- it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
(Grunts)
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
(Bell dings) Time!
(Whoops)
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
- He is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What?
What are you saying?
- What?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything...
- Anything, - 'cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not... you don't have any information
- about anything.
- Information at all.
Nothing.
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.
- What?
BIG SCHMIDT:
Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
(Laughs)
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt.
I mean...
- No.
We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
- Winston.
Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston...
Everybody else really hot, too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
Ooh!
Thank you.
JOAN:
Manly.
BOB:
Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
- Okay?
For you to have.
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take... that's right...
BOB:
What are we having here, turkey sushi?
What is this?
(Loud clink)
Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins!
Yes!
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
!
- What?
JESS:
In conclusion... (Clears throat)
I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said...
it couldn't be done.
They said,
"You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
JOAN:
Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait.
What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it
- in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day
- of my entire life.
NICK:
Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex.
Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
NICK:
You lit this place on fire,
- you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.
SCHMIDT:
Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs,
- I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.
- You can't volunteer right after...
- I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.
- Joanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.
I saw something.
You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural.
Bring it to you.
JESS:
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious.
No.
What?
Let me finish.
Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
- You have to admit that...
- No.
- What?
...
- they're never gonna make it work.
- No.
- And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
(Gasps) I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!
BOB:
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Honey, are you an addict?
Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes.
What, are you living with drug dealers?
(All talking)
When can we start eating?
- Are you into pot?
Is this a rehab?
- What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
(All talking)
When can we start eating?
It's off.
Off.
Shut up, everybody!
(Silence)
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
- Honey?
- Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess.
Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
(Laughs)
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't, 'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
(Laughs) I just...
I thought... maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that... since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life. (Chuckles)
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
(Laughs)
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
(Yowls)
(Laughter)
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
BIG SCHMIDT:
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
- Not for me.
- Hmm.
All right.
(Clears his throat)
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
BIG SCHMIDT:
Yeah.
WINSTON:
I know, right?
Yeah.
(Laughs) Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
All day!
(Groaning)
(Winston groans)
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
BIG SCHMIDT:
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
I'm...
WINSTON:
You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
(Whoops) I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
(Sighs)
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay...
Schmidt?
Yes...
I am...
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that
I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again-
- I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're done with those.
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
(Elevator bell dings)
(sighs)
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola-- handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys
- that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.
Oh, that's her.
- It's okay, man.
- What's okay, man?
- Oh.
- Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
- Come on, Cece, you know how to do this.
- Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug balls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
- All right.
- Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball?
- Dad.
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ ♪ It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...
- No...
- Sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
I don't...
Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap-- crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess.
Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Are you...?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
- Okay.
- He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went Legoltod with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides
I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho!
Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one-- you know the rule.
- Ah!
Look at that right there.
- That's...
Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
Okay.
- I, uh,
I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
Hey, Dad, you want to help us?
I have to stay away from salmonella.
You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says...
It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you,
- but it's been months.
- Jess.
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry, I thought,
I thought, I-
- I'm s-- I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram-- all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me...
Salmonella...
- Salmonella.
- Okay.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song, huh?
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.
- Great night.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after-- the afterparty.
- The afterparty.
- The after-- yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan:
We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap-- there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap;
- They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me.
I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular.
Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
- The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.
- Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...
Dead.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell-- dead.
Dead.
You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us,
- I mean, the voice of the NFL-- Steve Sabol?
Dead.
- Also dead.
- Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius.
All you got to do is
- follow the money.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
Yeah, it's my plan B.
Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between... whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the...
Carol is not a zombie?
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight thing where...
It's not like the Twilight...
No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't get it.
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight, that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
- It's the same as Twilight...
- Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen,
I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth--
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
- Go hit on her.
- What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her...
- Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't hit on...
- Hey, Mom.
Mom, uh,
- Jess...
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
I like your de, uh... your de... de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives,
Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two...
No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey!
All right.
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- All day.
I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!
Joan, I've got to say you are great... at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
- You want to give it a try?
- Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- Well, no, no, no...
- Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
- What?
Dad...
- Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously,
I'm not...
Okay.
Fine, you're right.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick.
♪ Every time I try to tell you ♪
♪ The words just come out wrong ♪
Nick!
♪ So I have to say "I love you" ♪
♪ In a song.
- Nick!
- I love that.
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
!
- I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...
Nick, this is not what we talked about.
- I know but it got...
- Give me that baster.
No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot?
What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation,
- Ha!
- And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade-- it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
- He is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What?
What are you saying?
- What?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything...
- Anything, - 'Cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not... you don't have any information
- about anything.
- Information at all.
Nothing.
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.
- What?
- Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt.
I mean...
- No.
We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
- Winston.
Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston...
Everybody else really hot, too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
Ooh!
Thank you.
- Manly.
- Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
- Okay?
For you to have.
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take...
What are we having here, turkey sushi?
- What is this?
- Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins!
Yes!
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
!
- What?
- In conclusion...
I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said...
it couldn't be done.
They said,
"You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait.
What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it
- in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day
- of my entire life.
- Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex.
Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
You lit this place on fire,
- you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.
Listen, if Jeanie's up for grabs,
- I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.
- You can't volunteer right after...
- I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.
- Jeanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.
I saw something.
You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural.
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious.
- No.
What?
Let me finish.
- Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
- You have to admit that...
- No.
- What?
...
- They're never gonna make it work.
- No.
- And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little jujube was high as a kite!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
- Honey, are you an addict?
- Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes.
What, are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
- Are you into pot?
- What are you doing?
- Is this a rehab?
- Are you selling your... body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
When can we start eating?
It's off.
Off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
- Honey?
- Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess.
Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't, 'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just...
I thought... maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that... since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
- Not for me.
- Hmm.
All right.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
- Yeah.
- I know, right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
All day!
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay...
Schmidt?
Yes...
I am...
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that
I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again-
- I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're done with those.
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola.
- Handmade.
- Eighteen dollars?
You're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals, so starve yourselves.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they have one meal together?
Sure they can.
If they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys.
My mom's gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00.
And then my dad's gonna be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys that my mom's a little perky.
Wait.
You think she's perky?
She doesn't have my dark side.
Got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads.
I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like them, don't trust them.
- Oh, that's her.
- It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
- Momsicle.
- Oh, jujube.
- Showed up looking like a Pilgrim.
- Every year.
- This is my mom, Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Come on over.
I wanna give y'all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball.
- Cece, you know how.
- Yep.
- You in the white shirt.
Come on in.
- I don't do hug balls.
- Hug ball jump in.
Hug ball jump in.
- Okay.
- You gotta jump in.
Whoo!
- All right.
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball.
- Dad.
- Oh, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
It's Jess
No, no, no.
It was my mistake.
It's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom.
- It's all right.
I'll spend my holiday at a coffee shop, sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't wanna blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad?
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9 a.m. And my dad's coming at 2:30."
No idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
- I don't...
- Mm-hm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap.
That's crazy.
Mom, Dad, help.
There's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
- Jess, are you okay?
- Jess?
What's the matter?
Are you all...?
Oh, damn it, Jess.
That's the second time today.
Smile, Mom.
You still got it.
- Jessica, what are you doing?
- I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
That was a long time ago, Cece.
When I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
What's with the crappy beer?
You hate that.
Let's just say my cousin doesn't have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota.
Went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
Been that way since we were kids.
Made my life hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Ha-ha-ha!
Yes, yes, yes.
Tell me he's gonna sit on you when he gets here.
- He's a good guy.
He's totally changed.
- Okay.
Settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went to Legoland with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any rides I was uncomfortable with.
- Ho!
Ha, ha!
- Oh!
- How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- All right.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Schmidt.
- I go by Schmidt around here.
There can only be one.
You know the rules.
Oh!
I'll give you that there.
Where's Krista?
- Krista and I have a new arrangement.
- Okay.
I, uh, can sleep with whoever I want.
But she doesn't speak to me or live with me anymore.
- Hey, Dad, you wanna help us?
- I have to stay away from salmonella.
- You don't have to lick it, Bob.
- No, no, no, my doctor said...
- It was a joke.
It was just a joke.
- My doctor says any...
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom, you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you but it's been months.
- Jess.
- I'm sorry, I thought...
I thought...
I...
I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram.
All those pictures of sad trees and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Bob, that's terrible.
I'm so sorry.
- No, really, I had no idea.
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.
Really.
- Come here.
Let me just give you a...
- Salmonella.
Salmonella.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song?
Huh?
- Yeah.
That was a night.
Great night.
- Do I remember that.
- No, I'm not talking about the concert.
- No, the after-party.
The after-party.
Yes.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly, this is a little bit crazy.
But if this is gonna work, you're both helping me.
- I'm out of here.
- Sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- They got married too young.
They got divorced too young.
I think this could make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan.
We're gonna make my mom look so hot, my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap, there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap.
It's a makeover.
Only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of schedule.
You're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap.
They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything?
- I've got something bad inside me.
I ruin things.
- Let's do this parent trap.
- Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She is spectacular.
- Wow!
- You know we used to date, right?
- You?
Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
- Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
Then I dumped her because I was, like, "Whatever."
- You mean when you ran away scared?
- Exactly.
You're not enough man for a woman like that.
- You are?
- Damn right I am.
If you guys wanna find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
And the winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
- What are you doing?
Nice.
- I'm bored.
It seems like every time they wanna move a team to Los Angeles the team that's most likely to move here, the owner, Al Davis, dead.
And they talk to the Ravens and their owner, Art Modell.
- Dead.
- Dead.
Know what I mean?
Who's gonna speak out for us?
The voice of the NFL, Steve Sabol?
- Also dead.
- Dead.
Exactly.
- You know, it doesn't take a genius.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
Follow the money.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
- Big business.
Chicken corporations.
- Uh-huh.
Corn.
Yeah.
Explain to me again why we're doing this?
Because when Cece's all washed-up as a model she wants to be a makeup artist and I wanna help her realize her dreams.
Yeah.
It's my plan B.
Okay, stop.
Seriously.
It's just too much.
The makeup and your dress?
I wear makeup in Portland to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
What's it about?
- It's about zombies.
- Zombies.
- And it's a relationship story.
There's a great love story that could be made into a movie.
- The love story is between whom?
- The zombie and Carol.
The zombie and the...
- Carol is not a zombie?
A regular person.
- A rich girl.
- So it's like Twilight.
- It's not like Twilight.
No, it isn't.
The vampire falls in love with a regular person.
It's the same thing.
Is there another guy in Twilight that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
- Yes.
It's the same as Twilight.
- Let me...
Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
- Yes.
- Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes.
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen, I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow.
I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
- The trap has been set.
- Is it working?
Mm-hm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
Go hit on her.
- What?
- My dad gets super jealous.
- If you go lay some sweet game on her...
- On your mother?
- I was gonna make Schmidt do it.
- I can't hit on your mother, Jess.
- Hey, Mom?
Mom.
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
Ahem.
I really like your de...
Your décolletage.
Say hello to my sister-wives, Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
- All right, time for delts.
- Oh, yeah?
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
It's all about size.
- Look at the mass on this bitch.
- That's stupid.
- What's your calf situation?
- Wanna see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two...
- No, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- Wheelbarrow?
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hands on the ground.
- Hey.
- Whoo!
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- All right.
- Come on.
Work those calves.
- I can do this all day.
- I got it all day, man.
- I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- I got it all day.
- I could do this all day.
- How long can you do this?
- All day!
- Yeah, I got it all day too.
- Winston!
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I could do this all day.
All day, Winston.
- This is great.
- I'm doing it all day!
Joan, I've gotta say, you are great at doing what you're doing.
- You've got those beautiful, strong arms.
- Ha, ha.
You wanna give it a try?
Okay, just...
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- No, no, no.
- Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry then.
Show me.
- Mm.
Yeah.
- We gotta get the whole thing.
- There you go.
- It is happening.
Heh-heh.
I can feel the chemistry.
I can hear it.
I sprayed all over.
Clean-up time.
Like, whoa.
- Jess, what are you doing?
- Watching the game.
- You're doing the Parent Trap thing.
- What?
Dad.
- Yes.
- I have a master's.
I'm not parent-trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously, I'm not...
Okay.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time.
It never works out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick?
Every time I try to tell you The words just come out wrong
Nick.
So I have to say I love you in a song
- Nick.
- I love that.
- Thanks for helping but I'm calling it off.
- She's doing one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, Jess.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
- I don't know how.
It happens all the time.
Don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Croce or the sweet smells of turkey...
- No, Nick.
This is not what we talked about.
- I know but...
- Give me that baster.
- No.
No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom, please.
Come on.
Brand new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
You don't have to do it.
You can go back to your basting.
- What, you get a little jealous, Bob?
- Of that idiot?
Are you kidding me?
- She's gotta stop doing this.
- I know.
- She's so stubborn.
- I wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- Of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got them.
Mm.
- I was just wondering.
Ah, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this thing is a draw.
I mean, you did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
I mean, you belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
How much more can you take?
I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right.
You know what?
Forget it.
I give.
- Yes!
Unh!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Yeah, but know this, all right?
Caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation and cheese courses and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
Okay, you may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood but I am Schmidt a refined and enlightened pescetarian, about 90 percent of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade, it's hot.
- A classic julienne.
- Marine Corps Cook of the Year, 2003.
Oh!
Ha, ha!
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
- Perfection.
- This is a masterpiece here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Makes sense with you two.
Must have worked up an appetite.
- What?
- Time!
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
Nice squeeze-bottle work, Bobby Flay.
- Okay, he is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Come on, we are getting hungry.
Why don't you stay here?
I'll sleep on the couch.
- What are you saying?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything.
- I don't know anything.
- You don't have information about anything.
- Nothing.
The answer is nothing.
- Happened.
- What?
- Answer a question.
Which plating is more masculine?
Do you guys wanna know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How?
- I'm super-secure.
You kiss a man.
- Ha.
Yeah.
- If you wanna be the one true Schmidt, I mean.
- No.
Yeah.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah.
- I'll kiss a man.
Winston?
You know, he'd do.
- Winston?
- I could go for stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
I'll kiss Winston.
I'll kiss Winston all day.
- I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
- Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston.
- Is everybody else really hot too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
- Thank you.
- Manly.
- Beautiful.
Hey, Winston.
Uh, I got you this.
It's an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
- Just make sure you take it.
What are we having, turkey sushi?
What is this?
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap is just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that, they're more complicated than that.
- And they're not even real twins.
- Twins.
Yes.
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters but they do it and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
- What?
- In conclusion ahem, I wanna say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said it couldn't be done.
They said, "You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
- Honey, what are you saying?
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- No.
- We saw you guys in the bathroom.
It was the greatest day of my entire life.
There was so much love there.
- And sex.
There's a sex energy too, Jess.
- And sex.
You lit this place on fire, you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
- It was a great kiss.
A hookup.
It meant nothing.
- If Joanie's up for grabs, I volunteer.
- I volunteer too.
- I volunteered first.
You can't volunteer after.
- I'm in the game.
- You just wanted me for my body.
- Yep.
And I'm fine with that.
Joanie, what if it was like that?
You guys had a spark.
You connected.
- Let's get natural.
- If you got together today it would be different.
I think you could make each other happy.
- I'm serious.
No.
What?
- Jess, you gotta let it go.
No, I'm not letting it go.
You have to admit they're never gonna make it work.
- And you scratched my van.
- Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
Ah!
I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
But the reason I was in your van is because your little jujube was high as a kite.
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, are you an addict?
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
- I don't sell my body for rent.
No.
- A women living with three guys...
When can we start eating?
...It's off.
It's off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just wanna be a family.
Jess, you have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess?
- Honey?
- Where are you going?
Jess.
The turkey.
Jess?
Honey?
Can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day and it could have been really nice but it wasn't because I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just...
I thought maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I'm just worried that since you guys are alone, that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami and start solving crimes together.
You have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah.
You know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
- Heh-heh.
- Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
- Rawrr!
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
- And so is your dad.
- Okay.
Are we doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mm-mm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
Nope.
Face smells like a dude's face.
Not for me.
All right.
Ahem.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston.
- What's up?
- Yeah.
- I know, right?
- Yeah.
Heh-heh-heh.
Hmm.
I can't do it.
Okay.
Well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
Winston.
All day!
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoo!
I did it!
I'm the one true Schmidt!
- You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
- Not on Thanksgiving!
Whoo!
I kissed a dude.
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache too.
I know she did.
You okay, Schmidt?
Yes, I am.
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
- Love you.
- Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
Love you, sweetheart.
Joan, I just wanna say that I'm really happy that, you know we got past all that.
- Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again, I will end you.
- Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Yeah, we're done with those.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
So I'll have to say I love you In a song
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola-- handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys
- that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.
Oh, that's her.
It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
- Oh.
- Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
- Come on, Cece, you know how to do this.
- Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug balls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
- All right.
- Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball?
- Dad.
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ ♪ It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...
- No...
- sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
I don't...
Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap-- crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess.
Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Are you...?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
- Okay.
- He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went to Legoland with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides
I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho!
Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one-- you know the rule.
- Ah!
Look at that right there.
- That's...
Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
Okay.
- I, uh,
I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
Hey, Dad,
- you want to help us?
- I have to stay away from salmonella.
You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says...
It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you,
- but it's been months.
- Jess.
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry, I thought,
I thought, I-
- I'm s-- I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram-- all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me...
Salmonella...
- Salmonella.
- Okay.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song, huh?
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.
- Great night.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after-- the afterparty.
- The afterparty.
- The after-- yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan:
We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap-- there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap;
- They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me.
I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular.
Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
- The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.
- Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...
Dead.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell-- dead.
Dead.
You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us,
- I mean, the voice of the NFL-- Steve Sabol?
Dead.
- Also dead.
- Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius.
All you got to do is
- follow the money.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
Yeah, it's my plan B.
Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between... whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the...
Carol is not a zombie?
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight thing where...
It's not like the Twilight...
No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't really...
you don't get it.
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight, that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
- It's the same as Twilight...
- Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen,
I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth--
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
- Go hit on her.
- What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her...
- Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't hit on...
- Hey, Mom.
Mom, uh,
- Jess...
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
I like your de, uh... your de... de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives,
Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two...
No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey!
All right.
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- All day.
I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!
Why are you yelling at me?
I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!
Joan, I've got to say you are great... at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
- You want to give it a try?
- Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- Well, no, no, no...
- Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
- What?
Dad...
- Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously,
I'm not...
Okay.
Fine, you're right.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick.
♪ Every time I try to tell you ♪
♪ The words just come out wrong ♪
Nick!
♪ So I have to say "I love you" ♪
♪ In a song.
- Nick!
- I love that.
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
!
- I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...
Nick, this is not what we talked about.
- I know but it got...
- Give me that baster.
- No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot?
What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation,
- Ha!
- And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade-- it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
- He is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What?
What are you saying?
- What?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything...
- Anything, - 'cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not... you don't have any information
- about anything.
- Information at all.
Nothing.
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.
- What?
- Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt.
I mean...
- No.
We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
- Winston.
Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston...
Everybody else really hot, too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
Ooh!
Thank you.
- Manly.
- Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
- Okay?
For you to have.
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take... that's right...
What are we having here, turkey sushi?
What is this?
Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins!
Yes!
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
!
- What?
- In conclusion...
I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said...
it couldn't be done.
They said,
"You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
- Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait.
What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it
- in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day
- of my entire life.
- Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex.
Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
You lit this place on fire,
- you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.
Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs,
- I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.
- You can't volunteer right after...
- I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.
- Joanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.
I saw something.
You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural.
Bring it to you.
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious.
No.
What?
Let me finish.
Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
- You have to admit that...
- No.
- What?
...
- they're never gonna make it work.
- No.
- And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Honey, are you an addict?
Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes.
What, are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
- Are you into pot?
Is this a rehab?
- What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
When can we start eating?
It's off.
Off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
- Honey?
- Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess.
Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't, 'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just...
I thought... maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that... since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
- Not for me.
- Hmm.
All right.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
- Yeah.
- I know, right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
All day!
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
I'm...
You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay...
Schmidt?
Yes...
I am...
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that
I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again-
- I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're done with those.
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?

- THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.
- TELL ME ABOUT THIS OTHER WAY, I'LL LET YOU GO.
- LUCY SAID SHE'D BRING JAMES AND I INTO THE BARN WITH HER.
- SO, LUCY LEFT YOU BEHIND.
- YOU TAKE ME TO JAMES,
AND YOU WON'T EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME AGAIN.
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I'M GONNA LET YOU NEAR MY SON?
- BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, EVERYONE YOU LOVE WILL DIE.
- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO, JAMES?
- I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.
- JUST SAYING IT'S POSSIBLE.
DANNY!
DAMN IT.
HAD TO BE ARLA THAT DID THIS.
- SHE'S GOT AUDREY NOW.
OKAY, METEOR STORM STARTED LAST NIGHT.
THAT MEANS THEY GOTTA BE LOOKING FOR THAT DAMN BARN.
IF AUDREY GOES IN...
- TROUBLES ARE GONE.
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED THAT WE MIGHT HAVE
JUST LOST AUDREY FOREVER?
YOU'RE THINKING THAT TODAY MIGHT BE THE DAY THE TROUBLES STOP?
- HEY, WAIT!
DID YOU FEEL THAT?
- NO.
- WHICH MEANS THAT THE TROUBLES ARE STILL HERE.
THAT MEANS THAT AUDREY HASN'T GONE IN THE BARN YET.
COME ON.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE BARN, RIGHT?
NOW, IF ARLA PUT A GUN TO AUDREY'S HEAD,
AND SHE HAD TO LEAD HER SOMEWHERE,
WHERE WOULD SHE TAKE HER?
WHERE?
- I--
PARKER AND I WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT WHERE THE OTHER AUDREY LOST HER MEMORIES,
THE FIELD WITH THE IMPRINT IN IT.
- YEAH...
- LIKE A BUILDING HAD BEEN THERE.
- OUT AT KICK 'EM JENNY NECK.
- YEAH.
- CAN ONLY GET THERE BY BOAT.
WE'LL TAKE MINE.
IF SOMEONE HADN'T STOLEN IT.
- ARLA.
- DAMN IT!
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
YOU'VE HAD WITH MY SON.
- WE'RE MARRIED.
WE'RE IN LOVE.
- TILL I TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE A PSYCHO SERIAL KILLER.
- SHH.
WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH.
LIKES TO CLIMB, NOT FLY.
ODD BIRD.
HELLO, AUDREY.
- AGENT HOWARD.
OR WHOEVER THE HELL YOU ARE.
- LOOKING FOR THE BARN, RIGHT?
COME ON.
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.
NO, YOU'LL TAKE US THERE.
- AH.
YOU MUST BE ARLA.
I JUST LEFT JAMES COGAN AT HAVEN JOE'S BAKERY.
- HE'S ALIVE?
IS HE OKAY?
- CONFUSED.
HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH TIME HAD PASSED.
KEPT WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO PAY PHONES.
HE'S STILL THERE.
GO TO HIM.
HERE.
SAY HI TO HIM ON HIS NEW CELL PHONE.
- JAMES.
- ARLA, IS THAT YOU?
- JAMES, BABY.
IT'S ME.
- I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TOO, BABY.
- I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.
IF YOU MAKE ONE MOVE TO FOLLOW ME, I WILL SHOOT YOU DEAD.
- COME.
WE'LL CHAT A BIT.
MAY I OFFER YOU SOME TEA?
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- THINK OF ME AS YOUR RIDE.
I DROP YOU OFF, AND THEN WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
I PICK YOU UP.
- IN A BARN?
- YES.
LOOK.
WELL, IT'S QUITE A BIT MORE THAN A BARN.
- HOW DID THAT GET HERE?
- IT COMES WHENEVER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT.
IT COMES WHEN YOU'RE READY.
- OKAY, SO THAT'S IT?
I GO INTO THE BARN, AND THEN THE TROUBLES END FOR 27 YEARS?
- NOT THAT SIMPLE.
IF IT WAS, I COULD JUST PICK YOU UP AND THROW YOU IN.
- NO.
YOU COULDN'T.
- YOU HAVE TO WANT TO GO IN.
YOU HAVE TO WANT TO GO AWAY.
THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS THE TROUBLES TO END FOR 27 YEARS.
- WELL, THEN, SEE, THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM, MORPHEUS.
I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY.
- YOU'LL BE BACK TO HAVEN.
- YEAH, BUT AS SOMEBODY ELSE, RIGHT?
AUDREY PARKER GOES AWAY.
AUDREY...
DIES.
- YES.
- BUT I DON'T WANT AUDREY TO DIE.
- OKAY.
GO AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE WAY TO STAY.
- WHAT?
I CAN JUST GO?
- YES.
BUT KNOW THIS, AUDREY.
THE SKY IS STARTING TO FALL.
WHILE YOU'RE OUT THERE ATTEMPTING THE IMPOSSIBLE,
TRYING TO STAY,
IT WILL CONTINUE TO FALL FASTER AND FASTER,
UNTIL THE TOWN AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE IN IT
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.
NOW, GO.
YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.
- AUDREY!
- OVER HERE!
- YOU'RE OKAY.
- HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
- DUKE STOLE A BOAT.
- BORROWED.
WHERE'S ARLA?
- SHE'S GONE.
BUT HOWARD, HE--
THE BARN IS GONE.
I GOTTA FIND ARLA.
SHE HAS MY SON.
- I'M--I'M SURE THAT IT'S ME,
BUT I THOUGHT THE METEORS ARE SUPPOSED TO PASS OVER HAVEN.
WHA--
WHY IS IT HITTING US?
- BECAUSE I WON'T GO IN THE BARN.
AND THEY'RE GONNA COME FASTER AND FASTER
UNTIL I FIND MY SON AND HE TELLS US HOW TO STOP THIS.
- FOUND HIM YET?
- VINCE.
YOU GOT THAT TWO-TON JACK?
A GUY ON BARKHOUSE DRIVE IS TRAPPED UNDER A WALL.
SAID HIS HOUSE EXPLODED.
- THE HUNTER STORM HAS BEGUN.
UH, YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.
- YEAH, I DO.
OH...
- I HAD TO DO IT.
HE'S LOST HIS MIND.
YESTERDAY, WE HAD ARLA THE SKINWALKER TIED UP,
BUT DAVE HIT ME OVER THE HEAD AND SET HER FREE.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW.
- VINCE, THERE'S METEORS FALLING.
WHAT IF THERE'S A FIRE?
DAVE CAN'T BE DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO KEEP LOCKED IN A TRUNK.
LET HIM OUT.
- OH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
- SORRY, DAVE.
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.
- MY SKIFF WAS ABANDONED AT SOUTH DOWN DOCKS.
JAMES AND ARLA LEFT IT.
- WAITER DIDN'T SEE A CAR, DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WENT.
- HE SAID JAMES WAS REALLY SICK,
THAT HE'S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.
- IF THE BARN KEPT HIM ALIVE,
MAYBE HE CAN'T LEAVE IT.
- THE WHOLE TOWN IS GETTING BOMBARDED.
- PUT OUT AN APB.
CONTACT ALL THE HOSPITALS, DOCTORS--WE'LL FIND HIM.
- I'M GONNA CHECK THE SECURITY CAMERAS AT THE DOCKS.
MAYBE THEY SWIPED ANOTHER BOAT.
- I'M SORRY, FOLKS, THIS ENTRANCE IS CLOSED OFF.
- OKAY.
I'LL RUN YOU A COOL BATH, OKAY?
THAT'LL HELP GET THE FEVER DOWN.
- I DON'T FEEL RIGHT.
- YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST NOT USED TO ALL THE MODERN BUGS.
IT'S ALL GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS NOW.
I HOPE SO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG.
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HELP YOU SETTLE IN AGAIN.
THINGS AREN'T SO DIFFERENT.
- ARLA.
- YEAH?
- IF I'VE BEEN GONE FOR 27 YEARS...
THEN WHY DO YOU STILL LOOK SO YOUNG?
- I STAYED YOUNG FOR YOU, SILLY.
NOW HUSH.
WE HAVE TO GET YOU WELL SO WE CAN GET YOU OUTTA HERE
BEFORE YOUR MOTHER FINDS US.
- HEY.
- ALL THIS TIME AND SHE'S STILL AFTER ME.
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND WHY.
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
OKAY, WE HAVE OUR LIVES TO LIVE TOO.
I WON'T LET HER HURT YOU AGAIN.
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
- I LOVE YOU TOO, BABY.
WHAT?
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
I HEAR YOUR JAMES IS SICK.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- HOW DO YOU THINK I KNOW?
AUDREY PARKER'S RUNNING AROUND LOOKING FOR YOU.
- SHE'S NOT IN THE BARN?
- NO.
YOU SEE, YOU CAN TELL BY THE CAR-SIZED ROCKS FALLING FROM THE SKY.
AND SHE'S NOT GOING IN UNTIL SHE FINDS JAMES.
SO, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE CAN BOTH GET WHAT WE NEED.
YOU WANT JAMES BETTER, RIGHT?
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- BUT THE BARN CAN.
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BARN IS.
- AUDREY CAN SUMMON THE BARN.
AND SHE'LL DO IT TO SAVE JAMES JUST LIKE SHE DID BEFORE.
- WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU, CROCKER?
- 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT AUDREY HAS TO GO IN THE BARN.
I'M TIRED OF LIVING IN A DISASTER MOVIE.
TROUBLES HAVE TO STOP.
YOU JUST MEET ME AND BRING JAMES.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
- DAMN IT, VINCE.
I KNOW WHAT VINCE TOLD YOU, BUT HE LIED, DWIGHT.
- SO, YOU DIDN'T FREE ARLA?
- NOT REALLY THE POINT.
VINCE KNOWS THAT I'LL TRY TO KEEP AUDREY OUT OF THE BARN,
AND THAT'S WHY HE TIED ME UP.
- SO, VINCE WANTS HER TO GO IN?
THOUGHT HE LIKED AUDREY.
- HE LOVES HER.
BUT HE SAYS HE HAS TO BE PRACTICAL.
BIG COWARD, IF YOU ASK ME.
THE LITTLE GUY'S GOT ALL THE FIGHT IN HIM.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- VINCE AND I TRIED TO KEEP SARAH
OUT OF THE BARN ONCE BEFORE.
LET'S JUST SAY IT DIDN'T WORK.
VINCE DECIDED THERE AND THEN THAT THE BEST THING FOR EVERYONE IS FOR AUDREY TO JUST KEEP GOING BACK IN.
THINK WE HAVE TO BREAK THE DAMN CYCLE.
WE HAVE TO FACE THE SITUATION HEAD ON,
DEAL WITH THE DAMN TROUBLES,
AND NOT JUST KEEP USING THAT POOR GIRL AS A BAND-AID.
- ANY IDEA WHERE WE CAN FIND VINCE?
- OH, YEAH.
I ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO FIND MY BROTHER.
- I TOLD YOU AUDREY COULD BRING THE BARN.
WE'LL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
SHE'S CLOSE BY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THIS BARN SAVED HIM LAST TIME.
WE JUST HAVE TO GET HIM BETTER,
AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
RIGHT, BABY?
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO, HUH?
YOU'LL BE OKAY.
OKAY.
- YOU DID ALL THIS FOR HIM?
- I DID IT FOR US.
YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE, CROCKER?
- NO.
- WELL, IF YOU HAD, THEN YOU'D UNDERSTAND.
- DUKE?
- DON'T MOVE.
CROCKER, GET THEIR GUNS.
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE HIM INSIDE OF THE BARN,
MAKE HIM BETTER, AND THEN BRING HIM BACK OUT TO ME.
- NO.
- OH, YOU WILL.
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU DON'T COME BACK THIS TIME...
I'LL BLOW NATHAN'S BRAINS OUT.
- NO.
YOU WON'T.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE TOMMY?
GAVE ME THAT GUN WITH NO BULLETS IN IT?
I DIDN'T FORGET THAT.
- YOU USED ME TO BRING JAMES TO HER.
- YAHTZEE.
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED THE TROUBLES TO STOP.
- I DO.
I WANT AUDREY TO STICK AROUND TOO.
IT SEEMS YOUR JAMES IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS
HOW TO MAKE BOTH THOSE THINGS HAPPEN.
- JAMES?
JAMES.
HELLO.
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.
HE'S NOT OKAY.
HE'S FADING.
- BRING HIM INTO THE BARN.
IT CAN SAVE HIS LIFE.
- PARKER, IF YOU GO IN THERE, YOU MIGHT NEVER COME OUT.
- HOWARD SAID THIS BARN ONLY COMES WHEN I'M READY.
MAYBE IT ONLY DISAPPEARS WHEN I'M READY TO LEAVE.
AND I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE...
EITHER OF YOU.
- HEY!
- NATHAN, I HAVE TO GO AFTER HIM.
HE'S MY ONLY CHANCE.
- THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- ME TOO.
- YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME OUT HERE AGAIN.
- YOU'RE NOT GOING IN.
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA STOP ME ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE THE BARN?
- I GUESS SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO STAY OUT HERE
AND WATCH THE SKIN QUILT.
NATHAN...
YOU MAKE SURE SHE COMES BACK OUT.
- I WILL.
- READY?
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
IT'S JUST A BARN.
- LOVE WHAT HOWARD'S DONE WITH THE PLACE.
- WHAT IS THIS THING?
- PARKER...
I CAN FEEL.
MY SKIN, THE AIR, EVERYTHING.
- MUST BE THIS PLACE.
- WHATEVER'S GOING ON WITH THE TROUBLES WITH HAVEN,
THIS...
BARN IS AT THE CENTER OF IT.
WE NEED TO TAKE IT OUT.
IT SOLVES ALL OUR PROBLEMS.
YOU CAN'T GET TRAPPED IN HERE IF WE BLOW IT UP.
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- HUH.
- THAT'S ME.
- NO.
THAT'S SARAH.
- SARAH?
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SEE US.
- ARE WE IN THE 1950s?
- THE BARN TRANSPORTED US BACK IN TIME?
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
- SO, DON'T DROP IT, VINCENT.
YOU'RE SHAKING, YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING.
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.
FOCUS.
- DON'T TOUCH IT.
- FOCUS.
- IS THAT VINCE AND DAVE?
- LISTEN TO 'EM ARGUING.
- GUESS SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.
- WILL YOU QUIT BREATHING DOWN MY NECK?
- YOU'RE SHAKING.
STOP SHAKING.
- IT'S LIKE WE'RE WATCHING A SCENE FROM THE PAST.
- HURRY UP.
- OR IT'S A MEMORY.
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF SARAH'S MEMORIES?
- GOOD.
GO, GO!
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!
IT DID NOTHING.
- IT'S COMPLETELY INTACT.
- THIS OLD BARN SHOULD BE SPLINTERS.
- THIS IS MORE THAN A BARN.
- WELL, THANK YOU FOR TRYING.
BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO GO.
- BUT WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR SON?
- I TOOK HIM SOMEWHERE SAFE.
- WAS HE WITH HIS FATHER?
- JAMES'S FATHER?
HE'S NOT EVEN BORN YET.
- NOT EVEN BORN?
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BLOWING UP THE BARN EARLIER.
MAYBE HOWARD OVERHEARD US.
- YOU'RE RIGHT, AUDREY.
THAT WAS SARAH'S MEMORY.
- THAT YOU SHOWED TO US.
- YOU'RE NOT TAKING AUDREY AWAY.
- OH, IT CAN'T BE STOPPED.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SHOW YOU.
- HOW DO WE KNOW THAT MEMORY'S EVEN REAL?
- HOW 'BOUT I SHOW YOU A MEMORY OF SARAH'S
THAT YOU KNOW IS REAL, NATHAN?
- I DON'T LIKE THAT.
- OKAY, SO, HE JUST SAID THAT IT WOULD BE ONE OF SARAH'S MEMORIES
THAT YOU REMEMBER, WHICH MEANS IT'S GOTTA BE 1955.
THAT'S WHEN YOU WENT BACK IN TIME TO FIND--
TO FIND DUKE, RIGHT?
DON'T YOU HAVE A JACKET LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.
THAT'S WEIRD.
UH, I DON'T THINK JAMES IS UP THAT WAY.
PARKER...
AUDREY, WAIT.
- OH, MY GOD.
- I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS EVER COMING BACK.
- HE'S HERE.
JAMES!
JAMES!
- PARKER?
PARKER!
PARKER!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
AUDREY.
- WHO ARE YOU?
- NATHAN.
NATHAN WUORNOS.
I'M YOUR FATHER.
- I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHO YOU WERE.
- THIS WOULD BE WEIRD EVEN IF WE WEREN'T MEETING IN A GIANT, SUPERNATURAL
STEAM ROOM.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
AUDREY AND I.
- WHAT, SO SHE CAN KILL ME?
- WHAT?
- AGAIN?
KILL HER SON TO SAVE HERSELF.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHEN I CAME TO HAVEN TO FIND MY MOTHER SARAH,
I FOUND LUCY INSTEAD.
SHE WAS FRANTIC.
SHE'D JUST FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR.
AND I SAID, "THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY."
- WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
WHAT'S THE OTHER WAY?
- ME.
MY DEATH WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD KEEP HER OUT OF THE BARN.
- BUT AUDR--
LUCY NEVER WOULD'VE HURT YOU, NOT EVEN TO SAVE HERSELF.
- THE DAY I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE HAVEN,
SOMEBODY SNUCK UP AND BASHED ME IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.
ARLA FOUND OUT IT WAS MY MOM.
- ARLA LIED.
LUCY STILL WENT IN THAT BARN.
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER EXPLANATION.
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR AUDREY
AS WELL AS YOU THINK.
NATHAN?
- PARKER.
GOOD.
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO--
- TALK TO WHO?
- I SAW JAMES.
- I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE.
- SETTLE DOWN.
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH SOMEBODY INSIDE THIS DAMN THING.
- YOU LOVE AUDREY, DON'T YOU?
AT LEAST ADMIT IT TO YOURSELF.
- SHUT UP.
I'M NOT TAKING ADVICE FROM A WALKING PURSE.
HEY!
- RELAX, CROCKER.
IF WE WANTED TO KILL YOU, THIS WOULD BE OVER ALREADY.
- HOW'D YOU FIND THE BARN?
- WE HAD EVERY MEMBER OF THE GUARD LOOKING FOR IT.
NOW WHERE IS PARKER?
- SHE'S INSIDE.
- DID I SAY YOU COULD SPEAK?
- SHE'S ALREADY GONE IN.
GOOD.
- THINK WE'RE GONNA WAIT HERE WITH YOU.
MAKE SURE AUDREY'S STILL IN THERE WHEN IT LEAVES.
- IF ANY OF YOU COME FOR THIS GUN,
I'LL SEPARATE AT LEAST THREE OF YOU FROM YOUR TROUBLES
BEFORE ANYONE TOUCHES ME.
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, DUKE.
WHEN THIS IS OVER, WE CAN ALL JUST WALK AWAY.
- HELL HATH NO FURY, EH, JORDAN?
- I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE OF NATHAN.
- RIGHT.
- WHEN THAT BARN DISAPPEARS, MY TROUBLE GOES WITH IT.
I'LL BE ABLE TO TOUCH PEOPLE, BE TOUCHED.
I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL AGAIN, DUKE.
I'D THINK YOU'D WANT IT TOO.
- HE'D RATHER HAVE AUDREY.
- I TOLD YOU, SHUT UP!
- BOTH YOU AND NATHAN...
IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN NEITHER OF YOU CAN HAVE.
IT'S ALMOST...
SAD.
- HE'S YOUR SON, ISN'T HE?
- OUR SON.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
NOT EXACTLY SURE
HOW THAT CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE GONE.
I GUESS IT WAS A WAY TO BE WITH YOU.
I KNOW THAT--
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY.
- NO.
IT DOESN'T.
PART OF ME'S GLAD.
AT LEAST THIS WAY, IF I DO DISAPPEAR,
I HAVE SOME PROOF THAT I EXISTED.
- YOU ARE NOT DISAPPEARING.
NOT THIS TIME.
- WHAT DID JAMES TELL YOU?
- JAMES THINKS HE'S THE ANSWER.
HE THINKS...
THAT SOMEHOW KILLING HIM ENDS THE TROUBLES.
WE NEED TO FIND JAMES.
FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO HIM.
- HOWARD?
I KNOW YOU'RE HIDING SOMEWHERE.
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.
I'M NOT MAKING MY CHOICE UNTIL YOU SHOW ME MY SON.
- OKAY.
HE'S RIGHT THERE.
- OH...
JAMES.
IT'S SO GOOD TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
- WHERE'S ARLA?
I WANT TO SEE HER.
- JAMES, THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT ARLA THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW.
- I WANT TO TALK TO ARLA!
- JAMES.
- JAMES, STOP.
- AH...
OKAY, THAT HURT.
- YOU WANT TO SEE ARLA?
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GO BRING HER TO YOU.
OH!
REALLY, VINCE?
OH, NO.
- THEY'RE JUST TRANQUILIZERS.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM,
BUT I CAN'T LET HIM STOP AUDREY.
- HE WANTS AUDREY TO GO BACK INTO THE BARN.
- BECAUSE I WANT THE TROUBLES TO END.
I WANT THIS TO END!
- NOBODY WANTS THE TROUBLES TO END MORE THAN I DO.
MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BECAUSE OF THEM,
BUT THIS CAN'T KEEP HAPPENING OVER AND OVER.
- VINCENT, WHAT IF AUDREY CAN FIND A WAY TO CHANGE THINGS?
- WE TRIED BEFORE.
- DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T TRY AGAIN!
- VINCE.
LOOK, GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE YOU GET HURT.
- TAKE THE MEN AND GO.
- BUT--
- GUNS ARE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS, KIRK.
GO HOME.
- YES, SIR.
- WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO HIM?
- 'CAUSE HE'S THE BOSS.
WE'RE LEAVING.
- YOU'RE IN THE GUARD.
- THEY WORK FOR ME.
ALWAYS HAVE.
- THAT EXPLAINS A FEW THINGS.
- VINCE, PLEASE.
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE AUDREY GOES AWAY, RIGHT?
- IT'LL BE HER CHOICE.
- I'VE LOST TOO MUCH.
I WON'T LET IT ALL BE FOR NOTHING.
- LEAVE NOW, JORDAN.
- SO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US, VINCE?
THAT TATTOO--
- I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU, DUKE.
- I APPRECIATE THAT.
- IN FACT, I'M THE REASON THE OTHERS NEVER WENT AFTER YOU.
AND BELIEVE ME, THEY WANTED TO.
- JAMES WANTS TO SEE YOU.
- I THOUGHT HE MIGHT.
JAMES.
HUSH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG?
- TROUBLES DON'T WORK IN HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- AFTER YOU DIED, OKAY, MY TROUBLE STARTED.
AND MY SKIN FELL OFF.
BUT I-I CAN LIVE INSIDE THE SKIN OF OTHER PEOPLE.
- TELL HIM, ARLA.
TELL HIM HOW MANY WOMEN YOU MURDERED TO GET THAT SKIN.
- YOU MURDERED PEOPLE?
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK SO YOUNG?
- BABE, I-- I DID IT FOR YOU.
- DON'T TOUCH ME!
- I WAITED FOR YOU.
I KILLED FOR YOU.
I KILLED FOR US!
- YOU KILLED--WHAT?
OH, MY GOD!
AAH!
- RUINED EVERYTHING!
- NO!
NO!
- HEY!
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT!
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.
JUST GET HER OUT OF THE BARN, IT MIGHT BRING HER BACK TO LIFE.
JAMES.
JAMES, IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
THE BARN SAVED YOU LAST TIME.
IT'LL FIX YOU AGAIN.
- ARLA LIED.
- YEAH.
- YOU DIDN'T KILL ME.
- NO.
WHY WOULD-- WHY WOULD I WANT TO KILL YOU?
- 'CAUSE THEN THE TROUBLES...
BUT THEN I GUESS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, DID IT?
- WHY WOULD KILLING YOU-- WHY WOULD THAT END THE TROUBLES?
- BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME.
L-LUCY SAID THAT KILLING SOMEONE SHE LOVED
WAS THE ONLY WAY TO END THE TROUBLES.
NOT--NOT JUST FOR 27 YEARS, BUT FOREVER.
HAVEN WOULD BE A TRUE HAVEN AGAIN.
- WHAT?
- BUT YOU'RE NOT LUCY ANYMORE.
WE JUST MET, SO YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
- HEY...
- WHO DO YOU LOVE, AUDREY?
- READY TO GO?
- WHY?
- THAT METEOR STORM IS ABOUT TO POUND HAVEN FROM THE FACE--
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE METEOR STORM.
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.
MY CHOICES.
WHERE'S JAMES?
- HEALING.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
- NO, I WANT HIM TO HAVE A LIFE.
THE LIFE THAT I CAN'T HAVE.
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE BELONGS HERE NOW, LIKE HIS MOTHER.
- WHY?
WHY DO I BELONG HERE?
- THINK OF THE BARN AS AN AMPLIFIER FOR YOU.
WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, YOUR ENERGY KEEPS THE TROUBLES AT BAY.
BUT AFTER 27 YEARS,
THAT ENERGY STARTS TO RUN OUT.
TROUBLES START AGAIN.
SO, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT AND RECHARGE.
- RECHARGE?
RECHARGE WITH WHAT?
- LOVE.
IT ENERGIZES YOU SO YOU CAN GO BACK INTO THE BARN
AND STOP THE TROUBLES AGAIN.
- AM I EVEN HUMAN?
- AUDREY...
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
YOU ARE VERY, VERY HUMAN.
- SO, I'M-- I'M TROUBLED THEN.
- NO.
- THEN WHY DO I NEED TO KILL THE MAN I LOVE TO END ALL THIS?
AM I BEING PUNISHED?
- IT DOES SEEM THAT WAY.
YES.
- THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY.
- I'M SORRY.
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS THIS ENDS.
ONE STOPS THE TROUBLE FOR 27 YEARS, THE OTHER...
FOREVER.
WE REALLY SHOULD GO NOW.
- WAIT.
I NEED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
- WHAT DID JAMES SAY?
- HE WAS WRONG.
KILLING HIM...
IT WON'T WORK.
GOOD-BYE, DWIGHT.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.
- I GOT IT.
- AUDREY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AWAY.
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE CAN TRY.
- NO, DAVE.
INNOCENT PEOPLE WILL NOT DIE TO KEEP ME OUT OF THERE.
- I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE EASIER THIS TIME, BUT...
IT'S NOT.
BYE, AUDREY.
- GOOD-BYE, VINCE.
DUKE...
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
- IT WAS EASY.
IT ACTUALLY WASN'T, BUT...
YOU KNOW ME.
I LIKE THE CHALLENGE.
- I'M SORRY I WON'T REMEMBER YOU WHEN I COME BACK.
ESPECIALLY COLORADO.
- PARKER, IF WE--
NO.
THIS IS NOT GOOD-BYE.
TAKE ME WITH YOU.
- NO.
NATHAN?
NATHAN, I WON'T BE ALONE, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL BE WITH OUR SON.
- I AM GONNA DIE BEFORE I LET YOU GO.
- I KNOW.
DUKE...
- AUDREY!
- MAKE SURE NATHAN DOES NOT FOLLOW ME IN.
PROMISE ME.
- AUDREY, DON'T DO THIS.
- PROMISE ME THAT, DUKE.
- I PROMISE, AUDREY.
- AUDREY, DON'T DO THIS.
- 27 YEARS, NATHAN.
THEN WE'LL GET TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
GOOD-BYE.
- WE'RE NOT LETTING HER GO IN THERE.
- YES, WE ARE.
LISTEN.
SHE'S TRYING TO HELP ALL THESE PEOPLE.
SHE'S TRYING TO HELP THIS TOWN,
AND IT IS HER CHOICE.
IT'S NOT YOURS.
IT'S NOT MINE.
I HATE IT.
BUT IT'S STILL HER CHOICE.
- YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER TOO.
- YEAH.
- THEN HOW CAN YOU LET HER GO?
LOOK AT HER.
LOOK AT HER!
- AUDREY, STOP!
- I THOUGHT IT WAS MADE FAIRLY CLEAR.
THAT WON'T WORK ON THE BARN.
- THAT WAS MADE CLEAR.
WHAT ABOUT HURTING YOU?
- THEY'RE NOT STOPPING.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP.
- GET HER, DUKE.
GO, SAVE HER.
- AUDREY!
- AUDREY.
AUDREY!
AUDREY!
- Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the hunter meteor storm hits, the troubles disappear, but then so do I.
- The guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
- Audrey is going in that barn over my dead body.
- Tell me about Sarah.
- You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath you're always somehow the same.
- There's a skinwalker in Haven?
- We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model.
Someone special.
- Arla Cogan?
- Skinwalker's building the Colorado kid's wife.
- You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
- There is another way.
- Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
- Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
- So, Lucy left you behind.
- You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
- What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
- Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
- Where do you want to go, James?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
- She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
- Troubles are gone.
- That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the troubles stop?
- Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
- No.
- Which means that the troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
Where?
- I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, the field with the imprint in it.
- Yeah...
- Like a building had been there.
- Out at kick 'em Jenny neck.
- Yeah.
- Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
- I don't know what kind of relationship you've had with my son.
- We're married.
We're in love.
- Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
- Shh.
White-breasted nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
- Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
- Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
- No, you'll take us there.
- Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
Say hi to him on his new cell phone.
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
- James, baby.
It's me.
- I want to talk to him.
- I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
- I can't wait to see you too, baby.
- I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
- Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
- Who the hell are you?
- Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
- In a barn?
- Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
- How did that get here?
- It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
- Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the troubles end for 27 years?
- Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
- No.
You couldn't.
- You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the troubles to end for 27 years.
- Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
- You'll be back to Haven.
- Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
- Yes.
- But I don't want Audrey to die.
- Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
- What?
I can just go?
- Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
- Audrey!
- Over here!
- You're okay.
- How did you get here?
- Duke stole a boat.
- Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
- She's gone.
But Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
- I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
- Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
- Found him yet?
- Vince.
You got that two-ton Jack?
A guy on barkhouse drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
- The hunter storm has begun.
Uh, you don't wanna know.
- Yeah, I do.
Oh...
- I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
- Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
- Oh, maybe you're right.
- Sorry, Dave.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- My skiff was abandoned at South down docks.
James and Arla left it.
- Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
- He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
- If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
- The whole town is getting bombarded.
- Put out an apb.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors... we'll find him.
- I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
Maybe they swiped another boat.
- I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
- Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
- I don't feel right.
- You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically modified foods now.
- I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
- Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
- If I've been gone for 27 years...
Then why do you still look so young?
- I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
- Hey.
- All this time and she's still after me.
I guess I understand why.
- That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, baby.
What?
- You have a problem.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So, maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
- You can't do that.
- But the barn can.
- I don't know where the barn is.
- Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
- Why should I trust you, Crocker?
- 'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
- Damn it, Vince.
I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
- So, you didn't free Arla?
- Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
- So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
- He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
- What are you talking about?
- Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
Think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
- Any idea where we can find Vince?
- Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
- I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
- You did all this for him?
- I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
- No.
- Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
- Duke?
- Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
- No.
- Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
- No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
- You used me to bring James to her.
- Yahtzee.
- I thought you wanted the troubles to stop.
- I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
- James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
- Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
- Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
- Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
Either of you.
- Hey!
- Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
- Then I'm going with you.
- Me too.
- You're not leaving me out here again.
- You're not going in.
- How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
- I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
- I will.
- Ready?
- What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
- Love what Howard's done with the place.
- What is this thing?
- Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
- Must be this place.
- Whatever's going on with the troubles with Haven, this...
Barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
It solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
- What just happened?
- Huh.
- That's me.
- No.
That's Sarah.
- Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
- Are we in the 1950s?
- The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So, don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
- Don't touch it.
- Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
- Guess some things never change.
- Will you quit breathing down my neck?
- You're shaking.
Stop shaking.
- It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
- Hurry up.
- Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
- Good.
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
It did nothing.
- It's completely intact.
- This old barn should be splinters.
- This is more than a barn.
- Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
- But who will take care of your son?
- I took him somewhere safe.
- Was he with his father?
- James's father?
He's not even born yet.
- Not even born?
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
- You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
- That you showed to us.
- You're not taking Audrey away.
- Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
- How do we know that memory's even real?
- How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
- I don't like that.
- Okay, so, he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find...
To find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
- Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
- He's here.
James!
James!
- Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
- Who are you?
- Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
- I've always wondered who you were.
- This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
- Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
- What are you talking about?
- When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "there's gotta be another way."
- What did you find out?
What's the other way?
- Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
- But audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
- The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
- Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
- Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
Nathan?
- Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
- Talk to who?
- I saw James.
- I need to know what's going on in there.
- Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
- You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
- Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.
Hey!
- Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
- How'd you find the barn?
- We had every member of the guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
- She's already gone in.
Good.
- Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
- If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your troubles before anyone touches me.
- This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
- Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
- I'm not here because of Nathan.
- Right.
- When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
- He'd rather have Audrey.
- I told you, shut up!
- Both you and Nathan...
In love with a woman neither of you can have.
It's almost... sad.
- He's your son, isn't he?
- Our son.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Not exactly sure how that conversation would have gone.
I guess it was a way to be with you.
I know that...
That sounds crazy.
- No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if I do disappear,
I have some proof that I existed.
- You are not disappearing.
Not this time.
- What did James tell you?
- James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks...
That somehow killing him ends the troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
- Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
- Okay.
He's right there.
- Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
- Where's Arla?
I want to see her.
- James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
- I want to talk to Arla!
- James.
- James, stop.
- Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
- You want to see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
- Oh!
Really, Vince?
Oh, no.
- They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
- He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
- Because I want the troubles to end.
I want this to end!
- Nobody wants the troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
- Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
- We tried before.
- Doesn't mean we can't try again!
- Vince.
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
- Take the men and go.
- But...
- Guns are not gonna solve this, kirk.
Go home.
- Yes, sir.
- What?
Why are you listening to him?
- 'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
- You're in the guard.
- They work for me.
Always have.
- That explains a few things.
- Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
- It'll be her choice.
- I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
- Leave now, Jordan.
- So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
- I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
- I appreciate that.
- In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
- James wants to see you.
- I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
- Troubles don't work in here.
What happened to you?
- After you died, okay, my trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-I can live inside the skin of other people.
- Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
- You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
- Babe, I...
I did it for you.
- Don't touch me!
- I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
- You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
Aah!
- Ruined everything!
- No!
No!
- Hey!
- This is your fault!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
The barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
- Arla lied.
- Yeah.
- You didn't kill me.
- No.
Why would...
Why would I want to kill you?
- 'Cause then the troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
- Why would killing you...
Why would that end the troubles?
- Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
- What?
- But you're not Lucy anymore.
We just met, so you don't love me.
- Hey...
- Who do you love, Audrey?
- Ready to go?
- Why?
- That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
- I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's James?
- Healing.
That's what you wanted.
- No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
- That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
- Why?
Why do I belong here?
- Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
- Recharge?
Recharge with what?
- Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the troubles again.
- Am I even human?
- Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
- So, I'm...
I'm troubled then.
- No.
- Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
- It does seem that way.
Yes.
- There's gotta be another way.
- I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really should go now.
- Wait.
I need to say good-bye.
- What did James say?
- He was wrong.
Killing him...
It won't work.
Good-bye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
- I got it.
- Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
- No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me out of there.
- I thought this might be easier this time, but...
It's not.
Bye, Audrey.
- Good-bye, Vince.
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
- It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but...
You know me.
I like the challenge.
- I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
- Parker, if we...
No.
This is not good-bye.
Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
- I am gonna die before I let you go.
- I know.
Duke...
- Audrey!
- Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
- I promise, Audrey.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- 27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good-bye.
- We're not letting her go in there.
- Yes, we are.
Listen.
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
- You're in love with her too.
- Yeah.
- Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
- Audrey, stop!
- I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
- That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
- They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
- Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
- Audrey!
- Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!
- Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the Hunter meteor storm hits, the Troubles disappear, but then so do I.
- The Guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
- Audrey's going in that barn over my dead body.
- Tell me about Sarah.
- You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath, you're always somehow the same.
- There's a skinwalker in Haven?
- We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model;
someone special.
- Arla Cogan?
- Skinwalker's building the Colorado Kid's wife.
- You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
- There is another way.
(clangs)
- Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
(gun clicks)
- Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
- So, Lucy left you behind.
- You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
- What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
- Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
- Where do you wanna go, James?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
- She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
- Troubles are gone.
- That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the Troubles stop?
- Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
- No.
- Which means that the Troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
Where?
- I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, a field with the imprint in it.
- Yeah, okay.
- Like a building had been there.
- Out at Kick 'Em Jenny Neck.
- Yeah.
- Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
- I don't know what kind of relationship you had with my son.
- We're married.
We're in love.
- Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
- Shh.
(chirping)
White-Breasted Nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
- Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
- Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
- No, you'll take us there.
- Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's Bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
Say hi to him on his new cellphone.
(ringing)
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
- Ah...
James, baby.
It's me.
- I wanna talk to him.
- I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
- I can't wait to see you too, baby.
(phone beeps)
- I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
- Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
- Who the hell are you?
- Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you UP-
- In a barn?
- Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
- How did that get here?
- It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
- Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the Troubles end for 27 years?
- Mm...
Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
- No.
You couldn't.
- You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the Troubles to end for 27 years.
- Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, Morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
- You'll be back to Haven.
- Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
- Yes.
- But I don't want Audrey to die.
- Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
- What?
I can just go?
- Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
(Nathan):
Audrey!
- Over here!
- You're okay.
(Audrey gasping)
- How did you get here?
- Duke stole a boat.
- Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
- She's gone, but Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
(whooshing)
- I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
- Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
(theme music)
(siren wailing)
(woman):
Found him yet?
- Vince.
You got that 2-ton Jack?
A guy on Barkhouse Drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
- The Hunter Storm has begun.
(muffled groan, thumping)
Uh, you don't wanna know.
- Yeah, I do.
(sighs)
- Oh...
(muffled speech)
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
(people screaming)
- Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
- Oh, maybe you're right.
(siren approaching)
(engine starting) (groans)
(muffled shouts) Sorry, Dave.
- All right.
- Thanks.
- My skiff was abandoned at South Down Docks.
James and Arla left it.
- Ah...
Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
- He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
- If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
(siren wails, horn honks)
- The whole town is getting bombarded.
- I'll put out an APB.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors...
we'll find him.
- I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
You know, maybe they swiped another boat.
(man):
I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
(indistinct chatter)
(people chattering)
(coughing)
- Okay.
(James mumbling)
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
- Ah...
I don't feel right.
- You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically-modified foods now.
- Ah...
I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
- Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
- If I've been gone for 27 years, then... why do you still look so young?
- I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
(coughing)
- Hey.
- All this time and she's still after me.
(sighs) I guess I understand why.
- That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, baby.
(cellphone ringing)
(ringing)
- What?
- You have a problem.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
- You can't do that.
- But the barn can.
- I don't know where the barn is.
- Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
- Why should I trust you, Crocker?
- 'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
(whooshing)
(rumble, siren wails)
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
(muffled shouting, banging)
- Damn it, Vince.
(muffled speech) (clanging metal)
(grunts)
- I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
- So, you didn't free Arla?
- Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
- So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
- He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
- What are you talking about?
- Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
I think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn Troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
- Any idea where we can find Vince?
- Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
- I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
(grunts) What's wrong with him?
- I dunno.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
(James grunts)
- You did all this for him?
- I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
- No.
- Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
- Duke?
- Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
- No.
- Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
- No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
(gun clicks)
- You used me to bring James to her.
- Yahtzee.
- I thought you wanted the Troubles to stop?
- I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
- James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
- Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
- Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
- Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
either of you.
(coughing)
- Hey!
- Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
- Then I'm going with you.
- Me too.
- You're not leaving me out here again.
- You're not going in.
- How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
- I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
- I will.
- Ready?
- What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
Love what Howard's done with the place.
- What is this thing?
- Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
- Must be this place.
- Whatever's going on with the Troubles with Haven, this... barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
Solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
(rumbling)
- What just happened?
- Huh?
(Car approaches)
- That's me.
- No.
That's Sarah.
- Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
- Are we in the 1950s?
- The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
- Don't touch it.
- Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
- Guess some things never change.
- Will you quit breathing down my neck?
- Well, you're shaking.
Stop shaking.
- It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
- Hurry UP-
- Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
- Good.
Come, come!
Go, go, go, go, go!
(ticking) (gasping)
- It did nothing.
It's completely intact.
This old barn should be splinters.
- This is more than a barn.
- Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
- But who will take care of your son?
- I took him somewhere safe.
- Was he with his father?
- James's father?
He's not even born yet.
- Not even born?
(ethereal whooshing)
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
- You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
- That you showed to us.
- You're not taking Audrey away.
- Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
- How do we know that memory's even real?
- How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
- I don't like that.
- Okay, so he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find... to find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
- Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
- Oh... my...
God.
- I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
- He's here.
James!
James!
- Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
- Who are you?
- Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
- Always wondered who you were.
- This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
- Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
- What are you talking about?
- When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was... frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "There's gotta be another way."
- What did you find out?
What's the other way?
- Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
- But Audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
- The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
- Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
- Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
(scoffs) (Audrey):
Nathan?
(footsteps approaching)
- Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
- Talk to who?
- I saw James.
- I need to know what's going on in there.
- Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
- You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
- Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.
Hey!
- Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
- How'd you find the barn?
- We had every member of the Guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
- She's already gone in.
Good.
- Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
- If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your Troubles before anyone touches me.
- This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
- Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
- I'm not here because of Nathan.
- Right.
- When that barn disappears, my Trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
- He'd rather have Audrey.
- I told you, shut up!
- Both you and Nathan... in love with a woman neither of you can have.
Um!
It's almost... sad.
- He's your son, isn't he?
- Our son.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Ah...
Not exactly sure how that conversation would've gone.
I guess it was a way to...
be with you.
I know that... sounds crazy.
- No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
(scoffs)
At least this way, if I do disappear, I have some proof that I existed.
- You're not disappearing.
Not this time.
- What did James tell you?
- James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks... that somehow killing him ends the Troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
- Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
- Okay.
He's right there.
- Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
- Where's Arla?
I wanna see her.
- James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
- I want to talk to Arla!
- James...
- James, stop.
- Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
- You wanna see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
(gunshot)
- Oh!
Ah...
Really, Vince?
- Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
- He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
(whooshing)
(rumbling)
- Because I want the Troubles to end.
I want this to end!
- Nobody wants the Troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
- Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
- We tried before.
- Doesn't mean we can't try again!
- Vince?
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
- Take the men and go.
- But...
- Guns are not gonna solve this, Kirk.
Go home.
- Yes, sir.
- What?
Why are you listening to him?
- 'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
- You're in the Guard.
- They work for me.
Always have.
- That explains a few things.
- Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
- It'll be her choice.
- I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
- Leave now, Jordan.
- So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
- I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
- I appreciate that.
- In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
- James wants to see you.
- I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
- Troubles don't work in here.
(James stammering)
- What happened to you?
- After you died, okay, my Trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-I can live inside the skin of other people.
- Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
- You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
- Babe, I...
I did it for you.
- Don't touch me!
- I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
- You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
(Shouting in rage) (panting)
- Ruined everything!
- Don't!
No!
Hey!
- Oh!
- This is your fault!
(Arla gasping)
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
Well, the barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
- Arla lied.
- Yeah.
- You didn't kill me.
- No.
Why would...
why would I wanna kill you?
- 'Cause then the Troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
- Why would killing you...
why would that end the Troubles?
- Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the Troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
- What?
- But you're not Lucy anymore.
- Um...
- But we just met, so you don't love me.
- Hey.
- Who do you love, Audrey?
(James breathing erratically)
- Ready to go?
- Why?
- That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
- I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
(Audrey scoffs)
Where's James?
- Healing.
That's what you wanted.
- No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
- That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
- Why?
Why do I belong here?
- Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the Troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
- Recharge?
Recharge with what?
- Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the Troubles again.
- Am I even human?
- Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
- So, I'm...
I'm Troubled then.
- No.
- Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
- It does seem that way.
Yes.
- There's gotta be another way.
- I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the Trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really... should go now.
- Wait.
I need to say goodbye.
- What did James say?
(whooshing)
- He was wrong.
Killing him... it won't work.
Goodbye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
- I got it.
- Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
- No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me outta there.
- I thought this might be easier this time, but... it's not.
Bye, Audrey.
- Goodbye, Vince.
(rumbling)
(sighs)
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
- It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but... you know me:
I like the challenge.
- I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
- Parker, if we...
No.
This is not goodbye.
Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
- I am gonna die before I let you go.
- I know.
Duke...
- Audrey!
- Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
- I promise, Audrey.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- 27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good bye.
- We're not lettin' her go in there.
- Yes, we are.
Listen!
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
- You're in love with her too.
- Yeah.
- Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
(grunts)
Audrey, stop!
- I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
- That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
(nervous breathing)
(gunshot)
(indistinct shouting)
(rumbling)
(mumbling) (Duke):
They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
- Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
- Audrey!
(distant explosions, rumbling)
- Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!

CNST, Montreal
PREVIOUSLY ON HAVEN...
IF I GO INTO THAT BARN WHEN THE HUNTER METEOR STORM HITS,
THE TROUBLES DISAPPEAR, BUT THEN SO DO I.
- THE GUARD WANTS AUDREY IN THE BARN TOMORROW.
- AUDREY IS GOING IN THAT BARN OVER MY DEAD BODY.
- TELL ME ABOUT SARAH.
- YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS COME BACK WITH A DIFFERENT NAME, BUT UNDERNEATH YOU'RE ALWAYS SOMEHOW THE SAME.
- THERE'S A SKINWALKER IN HAVEN?
- WE DISCOVERED THE SKINWALKER WAS STEALING
PARTS OF WOMEN'S FACES, BUILDING A CUSTOM MODEL.
SOMEONE SPECIAL.
- ARLA COGAN?
- SKINWALKER'S BUILDING THE COLORADO KID'S WIFE.
- YOU CAN'T STOP THE TROUBLES.
ONLY AUDREY CAN.
- THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.
- TELL ME ABOUT THIS OTHER WAY, I'LL LET YOU GO.
- LUCY SAID SHE'D BRING JAMES AND I INTO THE BARN WITH HER.
- SO, LUCY LEFT YOU BEHIND.
- YOU TAKE ME TO JAMES,
AND YOU WON'T EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME AGAIN.
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I'M GONNA LET YOU NEAR MY SON?
- BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, EVERYONE YOU LOVE WILL DIE.
- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO, JAMES?
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET
- I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.
- JUST SAYING IT'S POSSIBLE.
DANNY!
DAMN IT.
HAD TO BE ARLA THAT DID THIS.
- SHE'S GOT AUDREY NOW.
OKAY, METEOR STORM STARTED LAST NIGHT.
THAT MEANS THEY GOTTA BE LOOKING FOR THAT DAMN BARN.
IF AUDREY GOES IN...
- TROUBLES ARE GONE.
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED THAT WE MIGHT HAVE
JUST LOST AUDREY FOREVER?
YOU'RE THINKING THAT TODAY MIGHT BE THE DAY THE TROUBLES STOP?
- HEY, WAIT!
DID YOU FEEL THAT?
- NO.
- WHICH MEANS THAT THE TROUBLES ARE STILL HERE.
THAT MEANS THAT AUDREY HASN'T GONE IN THE BARN YET.
COME ON.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE BARN, RIGHT?
NOW, IF ARLA PUT A GUN TO AUDREY'S HEAD,
AND SHE HAD TO LEAD HER SOMEWHERE,
WHERE WOULD SHE TAKE HER?
WHERE?
- I--
PARKER AND I WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT WHERE THE OTHER AUDREY LOST HER MEMORIES,
THE FIELD WITH THE IMPRINT IN IT.
- YEAH...
- LIKE A BUILDING HAD BEEN THERE.
- OUT AT KICK 'EM JENNY NECK.
- YEAH.
- CAN ONLY GET THERE BY BOAT.
WE'LL TAKE MINE.
IF SOMEONE HADN'T STOLEN IT.
- ARLA.
- DAMN IT!
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
YOU'VE HAD WITH MY SON.
- WE'RE MARRIED.
WE'RE IN LOVE.
- TILL I TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE A PSYCHO SERIAL KILLER.
- SHH.
WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH.
LIKES TO CLIMB, NOT FLY.
ODD BIRD.
HELLO, AUDREY.
- AGENT HOWARD.
OR WHOEVER THE HELL YOU ARE.
- LOOKING FOR THE BARN, RIGHT?
COME ON.
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.
NO, YOU'LL TAKE US THERE.
- AH.
YOU MUST BE ARLA.
I JUST LEFT JAMES COGAN AT HAVEN JOE'S BAKERY.
- HE'S ALIVE?
IS HE OKAY?
- CONFUSED.
HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH TIME HAD PASSED.
KEPT WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO PAY PHONES.
HE'S STILL THERE.
GO TO HIM.
HERE.
SAY HI TO HIM ON HIS NEW CELL PHONE.
- JAMES.
- ARLA, IS THAT YOU?
- JAMES, BABY.
IT'S ME.
- I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TOO, BABY.
- I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.
IF YOU MAKE ONE MOVE TO FOLLOW ME, I WILL SHOOT YOU DEAD.
- COME.
WE'LL CHAT A BIT.
MAY I OFFER YOU SOME TEA?
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- THINK OF ME AS YOUR RIDE.
I DROP YOU OFF, AND THEN WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
I PICK YOU UP.
- IN A BARN?
- YES.
LOOK.
WELL, IT'S QUITE A BIT MORE THAN A BARN.
- HOW DID THAT GET HERE?
- IT COMES WHENEVER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT.
IT COMES WHEN YOU'RE READY.
- OKAY, SO THAT'S IT?
I GO INTO THE BARN, AND THEN THE TROUBLES END FOR 27 YEARS?
- NOT THAT SIMPLE.
IF IT WAS, I COULD JUST PICK YOU UP AND THROW YOU IN.
- NO.
YOU COULDN'T.
- YOU HAVE TO WANT TO GO IN.
YOU HAVE TO WANT TO GO AWAY.
THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS THE TROUBLES TO END FOR 27 YEARS.
- WELL, THEN, SEE, THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM, MORPHEUS.
I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY.
- YOU'LL BE BACK TO HAVEN.
- YEAH, BUT AS SOMEBODY ELSE, RIGHT?
AUDREY PARKER GOES AWAY.
AUDREY...
DIES.
- YES.
- BUT I DON'T WANT AUDREY TO DIE.
- OKAY.
GO AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE WAY TO STAY.
- WHAT?
I CAN JUST GO?
- YES.
BUT KNOW THIS, AUDREY.
THE SKY IS STARTING TO FALL.
WHILE YOU'RE OUT THERE ATTEMPTING THE IMPOSSIBLE,
TRYING TO STAY,
IT WILL CONTINUE TO FALL FASTER AND FASTER,
UNTIL THE TOWN AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE IN IT
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.
NOW, GO.
YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.
- AUDREY!
- OVER HERE!
- YOU'RE OKAY.
- HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
- DUKE STOLE A BOAT.
- BORROWED.
WHERE'S ARLA?
- SHE'S GONE.
BUT HOWARD, HE--
THE BARN IS GONE.
I GOTTA FIND ARLA.
SHE HAS MY SON.
- I'M--I'M SURE THAT IT'S ME,
BUT I THOUGHT THE METEORS ARE SUPPOSED TO PASS OVER HAVEN.
WHA--
WHY IS IT HITTING US?
- BECAUSE I WON'T GO IN THE BARN.
AND THEY'RE GONNA COME FASTER AND FASTER
UNTIL I FIND MY SON AND HE TELLS US HOW TO STOP THIS.
- FOUND HIM YET?
- VINCE.
YOU GOT THAT TWO-TON JACK?
A GUY ON BARKHOUSE DRIVE IS TRAPPED UNDER A WALL.
SAID HIS HOUSE EXPLODED.
- THE HUNTER STORM HAS BEGUN.
UH, YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.
- YEAH, I DO.
OH...
- I HAD TO DO IT.
HE'S LOST HIS MIND.
YESTERDAY, WE HAD ARLA THE SKINWALKER TIED UP,
BUT DAVE HIT ME OVER THE HEAD AND SET HER FREE.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW.
- VINCE, THERE'S METEORS FALLING.
WHAT IF THERE'S A FIRE?
DAVE CAN'T BE DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO KEEP LOCKED IN A TRUNK.
LET HIM OUT.
- OH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
- SORRY, DAVE.
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.
- MY SKIFF WAS ABANDONED AT SOUTH DOWN DOCKS.
JAMES AND ARLA LEFT IT.
- WAITER DIDN'T SEE A CAR, DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WENT.
- HE SAID JAMES WAS REALLY SICK,
THAT HE'S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.
- IF THE BARN KEPT HIM ALIVE,
MAYBE HE CAN'T LEAVE IT.
- THE WHOLE TOWN IS GETTING BOMBARDED.
- PUT OUT AN APB.
CONTACT ALL THE HOSPITALS, DOCTORS--WE'LL FIND HIM.
- I'M GONNA CHECK THE SECURITY CAMERAS AT THE DOCKS.
MAYBE THEY SWIPED ANOTHER BOAT.
- I'M SORRY, FOLKS, THIS ENTRANCE IS CLOSED OFF.
- OKAY.
I'LL RUN YOU A COOL BATH, OKAY?
THAT'LL HELP GET THE FEVER DOWN.
- I DON'T FEEL RIGHT.
- YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST NOT USED TO ALL THE MODERN BUGS.
IT'S ALL GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS NOW.
I HOPE SO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG.
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HELP YOU SETTLE IN AGAIN.
THINGS AREN'T SO DIFFERENT.
- ARLA.
- YEAH?
- IF I'VE BEEN GONE FOR 27 YEARS...
THEN WHY DO YOU STILL LOOK SO YOUNG?
- I STAYED YOUNG FOR YOU, SILLY.
NOW HUSH.
WE HAVE TO GET YOU WELL SO WE CAN GET YOU OUTTA HERE
BEFORE YOUR MOTHER FINDS US.
- HEY.
- ALL THIS TIME AND SHE'S STILL AFTER ME.
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND WHY.
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
OKAY, WE HAVE OUR LIVES TO LIVE TOO.
I WON'T LET HER HURT YOU AGAIN.
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
- I LOVE YOU TOO, BABY.
WHAT?
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
I HEAR YOUR JAMES IS SICK.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- HOW DO YOU THINK I KNOW?
AUDREY PARKER'S RUNNING AROUND LOOKING FOR YOU.
- SHE'S NOT IN THE BARN?
- NO.
YOU SEE, YOU CAN TELL BY THE CAR-SIZED ROCKS FALLING FROM THE SKY.
AND SHE'S NOT GOING IN UNTIL SHE FINDS JAMES.
SO, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE CAN BOTH GET WHAT WE NEED.
YOU WANT JAMES BETTER, RIGHT?
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- BUT THE BARN CAN.
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BARN IS.
- AUDREY CAN SUMMON THE BARN.
AND SHE'LL DO IT TO SAVE JAMES JUST LIKE SHE DID BEFORE.
- WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU, CROCKER?
- 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT AUDREY HAS TO GO IN THE BARN.
I'M TIRED OF LIVING IN A DISASTER MOVIE.
TROUBLES HAVE TO STOP.
YOU JUST MEET ME AND BRING JAMES.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
- DAMN IT, VINCE.
I KNOW WHAT VINCE TOLD YOU, BUT HE LIED, DWIGHT.
- SO, YOU DIDN'T FREE ARLA?
- NOT REALLY THE POINT.
VINCE KNOWS THAT I'LL TRY TO KEEP AUDREY OUT OF THE BARN,
AND THAT'S WHY HE TIED ME UP.
- SO, VINCE WANTS HER TO GO IN?
THOUGHT HE LIKED AUDREY.
- HE LOVES HER.
BUT HE SAYS HE HAS TO BE PRACTICAL.
BIG COWARD, IF YOU ASK ME.
THE LITTLE GUY'S GOT ALL THE FIGHT IN HIM.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- VINCE AND I TRIED TO KEEP SARAH
OUT OF THE BARN ONCE BEFORE.
LET'S JUST SAY IT DIDN'T WORK.
VINCE DECIDED THERE AND THEN THAT THE BEST THING FOR EVERYONE IS FOR AUDREY TO JUST KEEP GOING BACK IN.
THINK WE HAVE TO BREAK THE DAMN CYCLE.
WE HAVE TO FACE THE SITUATION HEAD ON,
DEAL WITH THE DAMN TROUBLES,
AND NOT JUST KEEP USING THAT POOR GIRL AS A BAND-AID.
- ANY IDEA WHERE WE CAN FIND VINCE?
- OH, YEAH.
I ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO FIND MY BROTHER.
- I TOLD YOU AUDREY COULD BRING THE BARN.
WE'LL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
SHE'S CLOSE BY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THIS BARN SAVED HIM LAST TIME.
WE JUST HAVE TO GET HIM BETTER,
AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
RIGHT, BABY?
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO, HUH?
YOU'LL BE OKAY.
OKAY.
- YOU DID ALL THIS FOR HIM?
- I DID IT FOR US.
YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE, CROCKER?
- NO.
- WELL, IF YOU HAD, THEN YOU'D UNDERSTAND.
- DUKE?
- DON'T MOVE.
CROCKER, GET THEIR GUNS.
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE HIM INSIDE OF THE BARN,
MAKE HIM BETTER, AND THEN BRING HIM BACK OUT TO ME.
- NO.
- OH, YOU WILL.
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU DON'T COME BACK THIS TIME...
I'LL BLOW NATHAN'S BRAINS OUT.
- NO.
YOU WON'T.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE TOMMY?
GAVE ME THAT GUN WITH NO BULLETS IN IT?
I DIDN'T FORGET THAT.
- YOU USED ME TO BRING JAMES TO HER.
- YAHTZEE.
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED THE TROUBLES TO STOP.
- I DO.
I WANT AUDREY TO STICK AROUND TOO.
IT SEEMS YOUR JAMES IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS
HOW TO MAKE BOTH THOSE THINGS HAPPEN.
- JAMES?
JAMES.
HELLO.
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.
HE'S NOT OKAY.
HE'S FADING.
- BRING HIM INTO THE BARN.
IT CAN SAVE HIS LIFE.
- PARKER, IF YOU GO IN THERE, YOU MIGHT NEVER COME OUT.
- HOWARD SAID THIS BARN ONLY COMES WHEN I'M READY.
MAYBE IT ONLY DISAPPEARS WHEN I'M READY TO LEAVE.
AND I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE...
EITHER OF YOU.
- HEY!
- NATHAN, I HAVE TO GO AFTER HIM.
HE'S MY ONLY CHANCE.
- THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- ME TOO.
- YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME OUT HERE AGAIN.
- YOU'RE NOT GOING IN.
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA STOP ME ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE THE BARN?
- I GUESS SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO STAY OUT HERE
AND WATCH THE SKIN QUILT.
NATHAN...
YOU MAKE SURE SHE COMES BACK OUT.
- I WILL.
- READY?
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
IT'S JUST A BARN.
- LOVE WHAT HOWARD'S DONE WITH THE PLACE.
- WHAT IS THIS THING?
- PARKER...
I CAN FEEL.
MY SKIN, THE AIR, EVERYTHING.
- MUST BE THIS PLACE.
- WHATEVER'S GOING ON WITH THE TROUBLES WITH HAVEN,
THIS...
BARN IS AT THE CENTER OF IT.
WE NEED TO TAKE IT OUT.
IT SOLVES ALL OUR PROBLEMS.
YOU CAN'T GET TRAPPED IN HERE IF WE BLOW IT UP.
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- HUH.
- THAT'S ME.
- NO.
THAT'S SARAH.
- SARAH?
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SEE US.
- ARE WE IN THE 1950s?
- THE BARN TRANSPORTED US BACK IN TIME?
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
- SO, DON'T DROP IT, VINCENT.
YOU'RE SHAKING, YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING.
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.
FOCUS.
- DON'T TOUCH IT.
- FOCUS.
- IS THAT VINCE AND DAVE?
- LISTEN TO 'EM ARGUING.
- GUESS SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.
- WILL YOU QUIT BREATHING DOWN MY NECK?
- YOU'RE SHAKING.
STOP SHAKING.
- IT'S LIKE WE'RE WATCHING A SCENE FROM THE PAST.
- HURRY UP.
- OR IT'S A MEMORY.
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF SARAH'S MEMORIES?
- GOOD.
GO, GO!
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!
IT DID NOTHING.
- IT'S COMPLETELY INTACT.
- THIS OLD BARN SHOULD BE SPLINTERS.
- THIS IS MORE THAN A BARN.
- WELL, THANK YOU FOR TRYING.
BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO GO.
- BUT WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR SON?
- I TOOK HIM SOMEWHERE SAFE.
- WAS HE WITH HIS FATHER?
- JAMES'S FATHER?
HE'S NOT EVEN BORN YET.
- NOT EVEN BORN?
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BLOWING UP THE BARN EARLIER.
MAYBE HOWARD OVERHEARD US.
- YOU'RE RIGHT, AUDREY.
THAT WAS SARAH'S MEMORY.
- THAT YOU SHOWED TO US.
- YOU'RE NOT TAKING AUDREY AWAY.
- OH, IT CAN'T BE STOPPED.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SHOW YOU.
- HOW DO WE KNOW THAT MEMORY'S EVEN REAL?
- HOW 'BOUT I SHOW YOU A MEMORY OF SARAH'S
THAT YOU KNOW IS REAL, NATHAN?
- I DON'T LIKE THAT.
- OKAY, SO, HE JUST SAID THAT IT WOULD BE ONE OF SARAH'S MEMORIES
THAT YOU REMEMBER, WHICH MEANS IT'S GOTTA BE 1955.
THAT'S WHEN YOU WENT BACK IN TIME TO FIND--
TO FIND DUKE, RIGHT?
DON'T YOU HAVE A JACKET LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.
THAT'S WEIRD.
UH, I DON'T THINK JAMES IS UP THAT WAY.
PARKER...
AUDREY, WAIT.
- OH, MY GOD.
- I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS EVER COMING BACK.
- HE'S HERE.
JAMES!
JAMES!
- PARKER?
PARKER!
PARKER!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
AUDREY.
- WHO ARE YOU?
- NATHAN.
NATHAN WUORNOS.
I'M YOUR FATHER.
- I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHO YOU WERE.
- THIS WOULD BE WEIRD EVEN IF WE WEREN'T MEETING IN A GIANT, SUPERNATURAL
STEAM ROOM.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
AUDREY AND I.
- WHAT, SO SHE CAN KILL ME?
- WHAT?
- AGAIN?
KILL HER SON TO SAVE HERSELF.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHEN I CAME TO HAVEN TO FIND MY MOTHER SARAH,
I FOUND LUCY INSTEAD.
SHE WAS FRANTIC.
SHE'D JUST FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR.
AND I SAID, "THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY."
- WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
WHAT'S THE OTHER WAY?
- ME.
MY DEATH WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD KEEP HER OUT OF THE BARN.
- BUT AUDR--
LUCY NEVER WOULD'VE HURT YOU, NOT EVEN TO SAVE HERSELF.
- THE DAY I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE HAVEN,
SOMEBODY SNUCK UP AND BASHED ME IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.
ARLA FOUND OUT IT WAS MY MOM.
- ARLA LIED.
LUCY STILL WENT IN THAT BARN.
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER EXPLANATION.
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR AUDREY
AS WELL AS YOU THINK.
NATHAN?
- PARKER.
GOOD.
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO--
- TALK TO WHO?
- I SAW JAMES.
- I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE.
- SETTLE DOWN.
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH SOMEBODY INSIDE THIS DAMN THING.
- YOU LOVE AUDREY, DON'T YOU?
AT LEAST ADMIT IT TO YOURSELF.
- SHUT UP.
I'M NOT TAKING ADVICE FROM A WALKING PURSE.
HEY!
- RELAX, CROCKER.
IF WE WANTED TO KILL YOU, THIS WOULD BE OVER ALREADY.
- HOW'D YOU FIND THE BARN?
- WE HAD EVERY MEMBER OF THE GUARD LOOKING FOR IT.
NOW WHERE IS PARKER?
- SHE'S INSIDE.
- DID I SAY YOU COULD SPEAK?
- SHE'S ALREADY GONE IN.
GOOD.
- THINK WE'RE GONNA WAIT HERE WITH YOU.
MAKE SURE AUDREY'S STILL IN THERE WHEN IT LEAVES.
- IF ANY OF YOU COME FOR THIS GUN,
I'LL SEPARATE AT LEAST THREE OF YOU FROM YOUR TROUBLES
BEFORE ANYONE TOUCHES ME.
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, DUKE.
WHEN THIS IS OVER, WE CAN ALL JUST WALK AWAY.
- HELL HATH NO FURY, EH, JORDAN?
- I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE OF NATHAN.
- RIGHT.
- WHEN THAT BARN DISAPPEARS, MY TROUBLE GOES WITH IT.
I'LL BE ABLE TO TOUCH PEOPLE, BE TOUCHED.
I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL AGAIN, DUKE.
I'D THINK YOU'D WANT IT TOO.
- HE'D RATHER HAVE AUDREY.
- I TOLD YOU, SHUT UP!
- BOTH YOU AND NATHAN...
IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN NEITHER OF YOU CAN HAVE.
IT'S ALMOST...
SAD.
- HE'S YOUR SON, ISN'T HE?
- OUR SON.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
NOT EXACTLY SURE
HOW THAT CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE GONE.
I GUESS IT WAS A WAY TO BE WITH YOU.
I KNOW THAT--
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY.
- NO.
IT DOESN'T.
PART OF ME'S GLAD.
AT LEAST THIS WAY, IF I DO DISAPPEAR,
I HAVE SOME PROOF THAT I EXISTED.
- YOU ARE NOT DISAPPEARING.
NOT THIS TIME.
- WHAT DID JAMES TELL YOU?
- JAMES THINKS HE'S THE ANSWER.
HE THINKS...
THAT SOMEHOW KILLING HIM ENDS THE TROUBLES.
WE NEED TO FIND JAMES.
FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO HIM.
- HOWARD?
I KNOW YOU'RE HIDING SOMEWHERE.
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.
I'M NOT MAKING MY CHOICE UNTIL YOU SHOW ME MY SON.
- OKAY.
HE'S RIGHT THERE.
- OH...
JAMES.
IT'S SO GOOD TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
- WHERE'S ARLA?
I WANT TO SEE HER.
- JAMES, THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT ARLA THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW.
- I WANT TO TALK TO ARLA!
- JAMES.
- JAMES, STOP.
- AH...
OKAY, THAT HURT.
- YOU WANT TO SEE ARLA?
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GO BRING HER TO YOU.
OH!
REALLY, VINCE?
OH, NO.
- THEY'RE JUST TRANQUILIZERS.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM,
BUT I CAN'T LET HIM STOP AUDREY.
- HE WANTS AUDREY TO GO BACK INTO THE BARN.
- BECAUSE I WANT THE TROUBLES TO END.
I WANT THIS TO END!
- NOBODY WANTS THE TROUBLES TO END MORE THAN I DO.
MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BECAUSE OF THEM,
BUT THIS CAN'T KEEP HAPPENING OVER AND OVER.
- VINCENT, WHAT IF AUDREY CAN FIND A WAY TO CHANGE THINGS?
- WE TRIED BEFORE.
- DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T TRY AGAIN!
- VINCE.
LOOK, GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE YOU GET HURT.
- TAKE THE MEN AND GO.
- BUT--
- GUNS ARE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS, KIRK.
GO HOME.
- YES, SIR.
- WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO HIM?
- 'CAUSE HE'S THE BOSS.
WE'RE LEAVING.
- YOU'RE IN THE GUARD.
- THEY WORK FOR ME.
ALWAYS HAVE.
- THAT EXPLAINS A FEW THINGS.
- VINCE, PLEASE.
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE AUDREY GOES AWAY, RIGHT?
- IT'LL BE HER CHOICE.
- I'VE LOST TOO MUCH.
I WON'T LET IT ALL BE FOR NOTHING.
- LEAVE NOW, JORDAN.
- SO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US, VINCE?
THAT TATTOO--
- I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU, DUKE.
- I APPRECIATE THAT.
- IN FACT, I'M THE REASON THE OTHERS NEVER WENT AFTER YOU.
AND BELIEVE ME, THEY WANTED TO.
- JAMES WANTS TO SEE YOU.
- I THOUGHT HE MIGHT.
JAMES.
HUSH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG?
- TROUBLES DON'T WORK IN HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- AFTER YOU DIED, OKAY, MY TROUBLE STARTED.
AND MY SKIN FELL OFF.
BUT I-I CAN LIVE INSIDE THE SKIN OF OTHER PEOPLE.
- TELL HIM, ARLA.
TELL HIM HOW MANY WOMEN YOU MURDERED TO GET THAT SKIN.
- YOU MURDERED PEOPLE?
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK SO YOUNG?
- BABE, I-- I DID IT FOR YOU.
- DON'T TOUCH ME!
- I WAITED FOR YOU.
I KILLED FOR YOU.
I KILLED FOR US!
- YOU KILLED--WHAT?
OH, MY GOD!
AAH!
- RUINED EVERYTHING!
- NO!
NO!
- HEY!
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT!
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.
JUST GET HER OUT OF THE BARN, IT MIGHT BRING HER BACK TO LIFE.
JAMES.
JAMES, IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
THE BARN SAVED YOU LAST TIME.
IT'LL FIX YOU AGAIN.
- ARLA LIED.
- YEAH.
- YOU DIDN'T KILL ME.
- NO.
WHY WOULD-- WHY WOULD I WANT TO KILL YOU?
- 'CAUSE THEN THE TROUBLES...
BUT THEN I GUESS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, DID IT?
- WHY WOULD KILLING YOU-- WHY WOULD THAT END THE TROUBLES?
- BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME.
L-LUCY SAID THAT KILLING SOMEONE SHE LOVED
WAS THE ONLY WAY TO END THE TROUBLES.
NOT--NOT JUST FOR 27 YEARS, BUT FOREVER.
HAVEN WOULD BE A TRUE HAVEN AGAIN.
- WHAT?
- BUT YOU'RE NOT LUCY ANYMORE.
WE JUST MET, SO YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
- HEY...
- WHO DO YOU LOVE, AUDREY?
- READY TO GO?
- WHY?
- THAT METEOR STORM IS ABOUT TO POUND HAVEN FROM THE FACE--
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE METEOR STORM.
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.
MY CHOICES.
WHERE'S JAMES?
- HEALING.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
- NO, I WANT HIM TO HAVE A LIFE.
THE LIFE THAT I CAN'T HAVE.
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE BELONGS HERE NOW, LIKE HIS MOTHER.
- WHY?
WHY DO I BELONG HERE?
- THINK OF THE BARN AS AN AMPLIFIER FOR YOU.
WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, YOUR ENERGY KEEPS THE TROUBLES AT BAY.
BUT AFTER 27 YEARS,
THAT ENERGY STARTS TO RUN OUT.
TROUBLES START AGAIN.
SO, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT AND RECHARGE.
- RECHARGE?
RECHARGE WITH WHAT?
- LOVE.
IT ENERGIZES YOU SO YOU CAN GO BACK INTO THE BARN
AND STOP THE TROUBLES AGAIN.
- AM I EVEN HUMAN?
- AUDREY...
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
YOU ARE VERY, VERY HUMAN.
- SO, I'M-- I'M TROUBLED THEN.
- NO.
- THEN WHY DO I NEED TO KILL THE MAN I LOVE TO END ALL THIS?
AM I BEING PUNISHED?
- IT DOES SEEM THAT WAY.
YES.
- THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY.
- I'M SORRY.
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS THIS ENDS.
ONE STOPS THE TROUBLE FOR 27 YEARS, THE OTHER...
FOREVER.
WE REALLY SHOULD GO NOW.
- WAIT.
I NEED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
- WHAT DID JAMES SAY?
- HE WAS WRONG.
KILLING HIM...
IT WON'T WORK.
GOOD-BYE, DWIGHT.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.
- I GOT IT.
- AUDREY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AWAY.
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE CAN TRY.
- NO, DAVE.
INNOCENT PEOPLE WILL NOT DIE TO KEEP ME OUT OF THERE.
- I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE EASIER THIS TIME, BUT...
IT'S NOT.
BYE, AUDREY.
- GOOD-BYE, VINCE.
DUKE...
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
- IT WAS EASY.
IT ACTUALLY WASN'T, BUT...
YOU KNOW ME.
I LIKE THE CHALLENGE.
- I'M SORRY I WON'T REMEMBER YOU WHEN I COME BACK.
ESPECIALLY COLORADO.
- PARKER, IF WE--
NO.
THIS IS NOT GOOD-BYE.
TAKE ME WITH YOU.
- NO.
NATHAN?
NATHAN, I WON'T BE ALONE, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL BE WITH OUR SON.
- I AM GONNA DIE BEFORE I LET YOU GO.
- I KNOW.
DUKE...
- AUDREY!
- MAKE SURE NATHAN DOES NOT FOLLOW ME IN.
PROMISE ME.
- AUDREY, DON'T DO THIS.
- PROMISE ME THAT, DUKE.
- I PROMISE, AUDREY.
- AUDREY, DON'T DO THIS.
- 27 YEARS, NATHAN.
THEN WE'LL GET TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
GOOD-BYE.
- WE'RE NOT LETTING HER GO IN THERE.
- YES, WE ARE.
LISTEN.
SHE'S TRYING TO HELP ALL THESE PEOPLE.
SHE'S TRYING TO HELP THIS TOWN,
AND IT IS HER CHOICE.
IT'S NOT YOURS.
IT'S NOT MINE.
I HATE IT.
BUT IT'S STILL HER CHOICE.
- YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER TOO.
- YEAH.
- THEN HOW CAN YOU LET HER GO?
LOOK AT HER.
LOOK AT HER!
- AUDREY, STOP!
- I THOUGHT IT WAS MADE FAIRLY CLEAR.
THAT WON'T WORK ON THE BARN.
- THAT WAS MADE CLEAR.
WHAT ABOUT HURTING YOU?
- THEY'RE NOT STOPPING.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP.
- GET HER, DUKE.
GO, SAVE HER.
- AUDREY!
- AUDREY.
AUDREY!
AUDREY!
Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the hunter meteor storm hits, the troubles disappear, but then so do I.
The guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
Audrey is going in that barn over my dead body.
Tell me about Sarah.
You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath you're always somehow the same.
There's a skinwalker in Haven?
We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model.
Someone special.
Arla Cogan?
Skinwalker's building the Colorado kid's wife.
You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
There is another way.
[Clangs]
Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
[Gun clicks]
Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
So, Lucy left you behind.
You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
Where do you want to go, James?
[Dramatic music]
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
Troubles are gone.
That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the troubles stop?
Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
No.
Which means that the troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
Where?
- I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, the field with the imprint in it.
Yeah...
Like a building had been there.
- Out at kick 'em Jenny neck.
- Yeah.
Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
I don't know what kind of relationship you've had with my son.
We're married.
We're in love.
Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
Shh.
White-breasted nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
No, you'll take us there.
Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
[Dials] Say hi to him on his new cell phone.
[Phone line trilling]
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
- [Gasps] James, baby.
It's me.
- I want to talk to him.
I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
I can't wait to see you too, baby.
[Phone beeps]
I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
Who the hell are you?
Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
In a barn?
Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
How did that get here?
It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the troubles end for 27 years?
Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
No.
You couldn't.
You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the troubles to end for 27 years.
Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
You'll be back to Haven.
Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
Yes.
But I don't want Audrey to die.
Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
What?
I can just go?
Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
Audrey!
Over here!
You're okay.
How did you get here?
Duke stole a boat.
Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
She's gone.
But Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
[Wind whistles]
I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
[Somber folk music]
[Siren wailing]
Found him yet?
Vince.
You got that two-ton Jack?
A guy on barkhouse drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
The hunter storm has begun.
[Muffled groan, thumping]
Uh, you don't wanna know.
Yeah, I do.
[Sighs]
Oh...
[Muffled speech]
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
[People screaming]
Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
Oh, maybe you're right.
[Siren approaching]
[Groans]
[Muffled shouts]
Sorry, Dave.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
My skiff was abandoned at South down docks.
James and Arla left it.
Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
[Siren walls, horn honks]
The whole town is getting bombarded.
Put out an apb.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors... we'll find him.
I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
Maybe they swiped another boat.
I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
[People chattering]
[Coughing]
Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
I don't feel right.
You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically modified foods now.
[Exhales] I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
If I've been gone for 27 years...
Then why do you still look so young?
I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
[Coughing]
Hey.
All this time and she's still after me.
[Sighs] I guess I understand why.
That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
[Cell phone ringing]
What?
- You have a problem.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So, maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
You can't do that.
But the barn can.
I don't know where the barn is.
Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
Why should I trust you, Crocker?
'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
[Whooshing]
[Rumble, siren wails]
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
[Muffled shouting, banging]
Damn it, Vince.
[Muffled speech]
[Grunts]
I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
So, you didn't free Arla?
Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
What are you talking about?
Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
Think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
Any idea where we can find Vince?
Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
- [Grunts]
- What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
- [Grunts]
You did all this for him?
I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
No.
Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
Duke?
Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
No.
Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
[Gun clicks]
You used me to bring James to her.
Yahtzee.
I thought you wanted the troubles to stop.
I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
Either of you.
[Coughing]
Hey!
Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
Then I'm going with you.
Me too.
You're not leaving me out here again.
You're not going in.
How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
I will.
Ready?
What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
Love what Howard's done with the place.
What is this thing?
Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
Must be this place.
Whatever's going on with the troubles with Haven, this...
Barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
It solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
[Rumbling]
What just happened?
Huh.
[Car approaches]
That's me.
No.
That's Sarah.
Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
Are we in the 1950s?
The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So, don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
- Don't touch it.
- Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
Guess some things never change.
Will you quit breathing down my neck?
You're shaking.
Stop shaking.
It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
Hurry up.
Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
Good.
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
[Ticking]
It did nothing.
It's completely intact.
This old barn should be splinters.
This is more than a barn.
Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
But who will take care of your son?
I took him somewhere safe.
Was he with his father?
James's father?
He's not even born yet.
Not even born?
[Ethereal whooshing]
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
That you showed to us.
You're not taking Audrey away.
Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
How do we know that memory's even real?
How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
I don't like that.
Okay, so, he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find...
To find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
He's here.
James!
James!
Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
Who are you?
Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
I've always wondered who you were.
This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
What are you talking about?
When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "there's gotta be another way."
What did you find out?
What's the other way?
Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
But Audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
- [Scoffs]
- Nathan?
[Footsteps approaching]
Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
Talk to who?
I saw James.
I need to know what's going on in there.
Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.
Hey!
Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
How'd you find the barn?
We had every member of the guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
She's already gone in.
Good.
Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your troubles before anyone touches me.
This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
I'm not here because of Nathan.
Right.
When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
He'd rather have Audrey.
I told you, shut up!
Both you and Nathan...
In love with a woman neither of you can have.
It's almost... sad.
He's your son, isn't he?
Our son.
Why didn't you tell me?
[Chuckles] Not exactly sure how that conversation would have gone.
I guess it was a way to be with you.
I know that...
That sounds crazy.
No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if I do disappear,
I have some proof that I existed.
You are not disappearing.
Not this time.
What did James tell you?
James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks...
That somehow killing him ends the troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
Okay.
He's right there.
Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
Where's Arla?
I want to see her.
James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
I want to talk to Arla!
James.
James, stop.
Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
You want to see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
[Gunshot] Oh!
[Groans]
Really, Vince?
Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
[Whooshing]
[Rumbles]
Because I want the troubles to end.
I want this to end!
Nobody wants the troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
We tried before.
Doesn't mean we can't try again!
Vince.
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
Take the men and go.
But...
Guns are not gonna solve this, kirk.
Go home.
Yes, sir.
What?
Why are you listening to him?
'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
You're in the guard.
They work for me.
Always have.
That explains a few things.
Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
It'll be her choice.
I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
Leave now, Jordan.
So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
I appreciate that.
In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
James wants to see you.
I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
Troubles don't work in here.
[Stammering]
What happened to you?
After you died, okay, my trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-I can live inside the skin of other people.
Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
Babe, I...
I did it for you.
Don't touch me!
I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
Aah!
[Panting]
- Ruined everything!
- No!
No!
Hey!
[Gasps]
This is your fault!
[Gasps]
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
The barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
Arla lied.
Yeah.
You didn't kill me.
No.
Why would...
Why would I want to kill you?
'Cause then the troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
Why would killing you...
Why would that end the troubles?
Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
What?
But you're not Lucy anymore.
We just met, so you don't love me.
Hey...
Who do you love, Audrey?
Ready to go?
Why?
That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's James?
Healing.
That's what you wanted.
No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
Why?
Why do I belong here?
Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
Recharge?
Recharge with what?
Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the troubles again.
Am I even human?
Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
So, I'm...
I'm troubled then.
No.
Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
It does seem that way.
Yes.
There's gotta be another way.
I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really should go now.
Wait.
I need to say good-bye.
What did James say?
He was wrong.
Killing him...
It won't work.
Good-bye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
I got it.
Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me out of there.
I thought this might be easier this time, but...
It's not.
Bye, Audrey.
Good-bye, Vince.
[Rumbling]
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but...
You know me.
I like the challenge.
I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
Parker, if we...
No.
This is not good-bye.
Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
I am gonna die before I let you go.
I know.
Duke...
- Audrey!
Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
I promise, Audrey.
Audrey, don't do this.
27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good-bye.
We're not letting her go in there.
Yes, we are.
Listen.
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
You're in love with her too.
Yeah.
Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
[Grunts]
Audrey, stop!
I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
[Gunshot]
[Rumbling]
They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
Audrey!
[Distant explosions, rumbling]
Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!
Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the Hunter meteor storm hits, the troubles disappear, but then so do I.
- The Guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
- Audrey is going in that barn over my dead body.
Tell me about Sarah.
You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath you're always somehow the same.
- There's a skinwalker in Haven?
- We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model.
Someone special.
Arla Cogan?
- Skinwalker's building the Colorado kid's wife.
- You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
There is another way.
- Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
- Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
So, Lucy left you behind.
You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
- What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
- Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
- Where do you want to go, James?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
Troubles are gone.
- That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the troubles stop?
Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
No.
- Which means that the troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
Where?
- I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, the field with the imprint in it.
Yeah...
- Like a building had been there.
- Out at kick 'em Jenny neck.
- Yeah.
- Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
- I don't know what kind of relationship you've had with my son.
- We're married.
We're in love.
- Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
Shh.
White-breasted nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
- Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
No, you'll take us there.
Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
Say hi to him on his new cell phone.
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
- James, baby.
It's me.
- I want to talk to him.
- I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
- I can't wait to see you too, baby.
I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
Who the hell are you?
Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
In a barn?
- Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
How did that get here?
- It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the troubles end for 27 years?
Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
No.
You couldn't.
- You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the troubles to end for 27 years.
- Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
You'll be back to Haven.
- Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
Yes.
- But I don't want Audrey to die.
Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
What?
I can just go?
Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
Audrey!
Over here!
You're okay.
How did you get here?
Duke stole a boat.
Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
- She's gone.
But Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
- I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
- Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
Found him yet?
Vince.
You got that two-ton Jack?
A guy on barkhouse drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
- The Hunter storm has begun.
Uh, you don't wanna know.
Yeah, I do.
Oh...
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
- Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Sorry, Dave.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- My skiff was abandoned at South down docks.
James and Arla left it.
- Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
- He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
- If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
- The whole town is getting bombarded.
Put out an APB.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors... we'll find him.
- I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
Maybe they swiped another boat.
- I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
I don't feel right.
- You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically modified foods now.
I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
- Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
- If I've been gone for 27 years...
Then why do you still look so young?
- I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
Hey.
- All this time and she's still after me.
I guess I understand why.
That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
What?
- You have a problem.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So, maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
You can't do that.
But the barn can.
- I don't know where the barn is.
Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
- Why should I trust you, Crocker?
- 'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
Damn it, Vince.
I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
So, you didn't free Arla?
Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
- So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
What are you talking about?
- Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
Think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
- Any idea where we can find Vince?
Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
- I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
You did all this for him?
I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
No.
- Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
Duke?
Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
No.
Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
- You used me to bring James to her.
Yahtzee.
- I thought you wanted the troubles to stop.
I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
- Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
- Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
Either of you.
Hey!
- Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
Then I'm going with you.
Me too.
- You're not leaving me out here again.
You're not going in.
- How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
- I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
I will.
Ready?
- What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
- Love what Howard's done with the place.
What is this thing?
Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
Must be this place.
- Whatever's going on with the troubles with Haven, this...
Barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
It solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
What just happened?
Huh.
That's me.
No.
That's Sarah.
Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
Are we in the 1950s?
- The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So, don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
- Don't touch it.
- Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
- Guess some things never change.
- Will you quit breathing down my neck?
- You're shaking.
Stop shaking.
- It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
Hurry up.
Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
- Good.
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
It did nothing.
It's completely intact.
- This old barn should be splinters.
- This is more than a barn.
Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
- But who will take care of your son?
- I took him somewhere safe.
Was he with his father?
James's father?
He's not even born yet.
Not even born?
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
- You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
That you showed to us.
- You're not taking Audrey away.
Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
- How do we know that memory's even real?
- How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
I don't like that.
- Okay, so, he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find...
To find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
- Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
Oh, my God.
- I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
He's here.
James!
James!
Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
Who are you?
- Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
- I've always wondered who you were.
- This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
What are you talking about?
- When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "there's gotta be another way."
- What did you find out?
What's the other way?
Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
But Audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
- The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
- Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
Nathan?
Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
Talk to who?
I saw James.
- I need to know what's going on in there.
Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.
Hey!
Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
How'd you find the barn?
- We had every member of The Guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
She's already gone in.
Good.
- Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
- If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your troubles before anyone touches me.
This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
- Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
- I'm not here because of Nathan.
Right.
- When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
He'd rather have Audrey.
I told you, shut up!
Both you and Nathan...
In love with a woman neither of you can have.
It's almost... sad.
He's your son, isn't he?
Our son.
Why didn't you tell me?
Not exactly sure how that conversation would have gone.
I guess it was a way to be with you.
I know that...
That sounds crazy.
No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if I do disappear,
I have some proof that I existed.
You are not disappearing.
Not this time.
What did James tell you?
- James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks...
That somehow killing him ends the troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
Okay.
He's right there.
Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
- Where's Arla?
I want to see her.
- James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
I want to talk to Arla!
James.
James, stop.
- Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
You want to see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
Oh!
Really, Vince?
Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
- He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
- Because I want the troubles to end.
I want this to end!
- Nobody wants the troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
- Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
We tried before.
- Doesn't mean we can't try again!
Vince.
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
Take the men and go.
But...
- Guns are not gonna solve this, Kirk.
Go home.
Yes, sir.
What?
Why are you listening to him?
'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
You're in The Guard.
They work for me.
Always have.
- That explains a few things.
Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
It'll be her choice.
I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
Leave now, Jordan.
- So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
- I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
I appreciate that.
- In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
James wants to see you.
I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
- Troubles don't work in here.
What happened to you?
- After you died, okay, my trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-I can live inside the skin of other people.
Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
- Babe, I...
I did it for you.
Don't touch me!
I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
- You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
Aah!
- Ruined everything!
- No!
No!
Hey!
This is your fault!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
The barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
Arla lied.
Yeah.
You didn't kill me.
- No.
Why would...
Why would I want to kill you?
'Cause then the troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
- Why would killing you...
Why would that end the troubles?
Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
What?
But you're not Lucy anymore.
We just met, so you don't love me.
Hey...
Who do you love, Audrey?
Ready to go?
Why?
- That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
- I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's James?
- Healing.
That's what you wanted.
- No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
- Why?
Why do I belong here?
- Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
Recharge?
Recharge with what?
Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the troubles again.
Am I even human?
Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
- So, I'm...
I'm troubled then.
No.
- Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
It does seem that way.
Yes.
- There's gotta be another way.
I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really should go now.
Wait.
I need to say good-bye.
What did James say?
He was wrong.
Killing him...
It won't work.
Good-bye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
I got it.
Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me out of there.
- I thought this might be easier this time, but...
It's not.
Bye, Audrey.
Good-bye, Vince.
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but...
You know me.
I like the challenge.
- I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
Parker, if we...
No.
This is not good-bye.
Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
- I am gonna die before I let you go.
I know.
Duke...
- Audrey!
- Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
I promise, Audrey.
Audrey, don't do this.
27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good-bye.
- We're not letting her go in there.
Yes, we are.
Listen.
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
- You're in love with her too.
Yeah.
- Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
Audrey, stop!
- I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
Audrey!
Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!
Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the Hunter Meteor Storm hits, the troubles disappear, but then so do I.
The guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
Audrey is going in that barn over my dead body.
Tell me about Sarah.
You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath you're always somehow the same.
There's a skinwalker in Haven?
We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model.
Someone special.
Arla Cogan?
Skinwalker's building the Colorado Kid's wife.
You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
There is another way.
Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
So, Lucy left you behind.
You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
Where do you want to go, James?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
Troubles are gone.
That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the troubles stop?
Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
No.
Which means that the troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
- Where?
- I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, the field with the imprint in it.
Yeah...
Like a building had been there.
- Out at Kick 'Em Jenny Neck.
- Yeah.
Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
I don't know what kind of relationship you've had with my son.
We're married.
We're in love.
Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
Shh.
White-Breasted Nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
No, you'll take us there.
Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's Bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
Say hi to him on his new cell phone.
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
James, baby.
It's me.
I want to talk to him.
I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
I can't wait to see you too, baby.
I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
Who the hell are you?
Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
In a barn?
Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
How did that get here?
It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the troubles end for 27 years?
Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
No.
You couldn't.
You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the troubles to end for 27 years.
Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, Morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
You'll be back to Haven.
Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
Yes.
But I don't want Audrey to die.
Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
What?
I can just go?
Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
Audrey!
Over here!
You're okay.
How did you get here?
Duke stole a boat.
Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
She's gone.
But Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
Haven 03x13 Thanks For The Memories Original Air Date January 17, 2013
Found him yet?
Vince.
You got that two-ton Jack?
A guy on Barkhouse Drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
The Hunter Storm has begun.
Uh, you don't wanna know.
Yeah, I do.
Oh...
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Sorry, Dave.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
My skiff was abandoned at South Down Docks.
James and Arla left it.
Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
The whole town is getting bombarded.
Put out an APB.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors... we'll find him.
I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
Maybe they swiped another boat.
I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
I don't feel right.
You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically modified foods now.
I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
If I've been gone for 27 years...
Then why do you still look so young?
I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
Hey.
All this time and she's still after me.
I guess I understand why.
That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
What?
You have a problem.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So, maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
You can't do that.
But the barn can.
I don't know where the barn is.
Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
Why should I trust you, Crocker?
'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
Damn it, Vince.
I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
So, you didn't free Arla?
Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
What are you talking about?
Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
Think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
Any idea where we can find Vince?
Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
You did all this for him?
I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
No.
Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
Duke?
Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
No.
Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
You used me to bring James to her.
Yahtzee.
I thought you wanted the troubles to stop.
I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
Either of you.
Hey!
Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
Then I'm going with you.
Me too.
You're not leaving me out here again.
You're not going in.
How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
I will.
Ready?
What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
Love what Howard's done with the place.
What is this thing?
Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
Must be this place.
Whatever's going on with the troubles with Haven, this...
Barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
It solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
What just happened?
Huh.
That's me.
No.
That's Sarah.
Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
Are we in the 1950s?
The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So, don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
Don't touch it.
Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
Guess some things never change.
Will you quit breathing down my neck?
You're shaking.
Stop shaking.
It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
Hurry up.
Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
Good.
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
It did nothing.
It's completely intact.
This old barn should be splinters.
This is more than a barn.
Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
But who will take care of your son?
I took him somewhere safe.
Was he with his father?
James's father?
He's not even born yet.
Not even born?
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
That you showed to us.
You're not taking Audrey away.
Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
How do we know that memory's even real?
How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
I don't like that.
Okay, so, he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find...
To find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
He's here.
James!
James!
Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
Who are you?
Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
I've always wondered who you were.
This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
What are you talking about?
When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "there's gotta be another way."
What did you find out?
What's the other way?
Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
But Audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
Nathan?
Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
Talk to who?
I saw James.
I need to know what's going on in there.
Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a lking purse.
Hey!
Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
How'd you find the barn?
We had every member of the guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
She's already gone in.
Good.
Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your troubles before anyone touches me.
This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
I'm not here because of Nathan.
Right.
When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
He'd rather have Audrey.
I told you, shut up!
Both you and Nathan...
In love with a woman neither of you can have.
It's almost... sad.
He's your son, isn't he?
Our son.
Why didn't you tell me?
Not exactly sure how that conversation would have gone.
I guess it was a way to be with you.
I know that... that sounds crazy.
No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if I do disappear,
I have some proof that I existed.
You are not disappearing.
Not this time.
What did James tell you?
James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks... that somehow killing him ends the troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
Okay.
He's right there.
Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
Where's Arla?
I want to see her.
James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
I want to talk to Arla!
James.
James, stop.
Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
You want to see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
Oh!
Really, Vince?
Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
Because I want the troubles to end.
I want this to end!
Nobody wants the troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
We tried before.
Doesn't mean we can't try again!
Vince.
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
Take the men and go.
But...
Guns are not gonna solve this, Kirk.
Go home.
Yes, sir.
What?
Why are you listening to him?
'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
You're in the guard.
They work for me.
Always have.
That explains a few things.
Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
It'll be her choice.
I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
Leave now, Jordan.
So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
I appreciate that.
In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
James wants to see you.
I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
Troubles don't work in here.
What happened to you?
After you died, okay, my trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-I can live inside the skin of other people.
Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
Babe, I...
I did it for you.
Don't touch me!
I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
Aah!
- Ruined everything!
- No!
No!
Hey!
This is your fault!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
The barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
Arla lied.
Yeah.
You didn't kill me.
No.
Why would...
why would I want to kill you?
'Cause then the troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
Why would killing you...
why would that end the troubles?
Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
What?
But you're not Lucy anymore.
We just met, so you don't love me.
Hey...
Who do you love, Audrey?
Ready to go?
Why?
That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's James?
Healing.
That's what you wanted.
No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
Why?
Why do I belong here?
Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
Recharge?
Recharge with what?
Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the troubles again.
Am I even human?
Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
So, I'm...
I'm troubled then.
No.
Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
It does seem that way.
Yes.
There's gotta be another way.
I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really should go now.
Wait.
I need to say good-bye.
What did James say?
He was wrong.
Killing him... it won't work.
Good-bye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
I got it.
Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me out of there.
I thought this might be easier this time, but... it's not.
Bye, Audrey.
Goodbye, Vince.
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but... you know me.
I like the challenge.
I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
Parker, if we...
No.
This is not good-bye.
- Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
I am gonna die before I let you go.
I know.
Duke...
Audrey!
Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
I promise, Audrey.
Audrey, don't do this.
27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good-bye.
We're not letting her go in there.
Yes, we are.
Listen.
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
You're in love with her too.
Yeah.
Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
Audrey, stop!
I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
Audrey!
Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!
Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the Hunter Meteor Storm hits, the troubles disappear, but then so do I.
The guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
Audrey is going in that barn over my dead body.
Tell me about Sarah.
You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath you're always somehow the same.
There's a skinwalker in Haven?
We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model.
Someone special.
Arla Cogan?
Skinwalker's building the Colorado Kid's wife.
You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
There is another way.
Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
So, Lucy left you behind.
You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
Where do you want to go, James?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
Troubles are gone.
That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the troubles stop?
Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
No.
Which means that the troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
- Where?
- I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, the field with the imprint in it.
Yeah...
Like a building had been there.
- Out at Kick 'Em Jenny Neck.
- Yeah.
Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
I don't know what kind of relationship you've had with my son.
We're married.
We're in love.
Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
Shh.
White-Breasted Nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
No, you'll take us there.
Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's Bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
Say hi to him on his new cell phone.
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
James, baby.
It's me.
I want to talk to him.
I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
I can't wait to see you too, baby.
I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
Who the hell are you?
Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
In a barn?
Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
How did that get here?
It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the troubles end for 27 years?
Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
No.
You couldn't.
You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the troubles to end for 27 years.
Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, Morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
You'll be back to Haven.
Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
Yes.
But I don't want Audrey to die.
Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
What?
I can just go?
Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
Audrey!
Over here!
You're okay.
How did you get here?
Duke stole a boat.
Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
She's gone.
But Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
Haven 03x13 Thanks For The Memories Original Air Date January 17, 2013
Found him yet?
Vince.
You got that two-ton Jack?
A guy on Barkhouse Drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
The Hunter Storm has begun.
Uh, you don't wanna know.
Yeah, I do.
Oh...
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Sorry, Dave.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
My skiff was abandoned at South Down Docks.
James and Arla left it.
Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
The whole town is getting bombarded.
Put out an APB.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors... we'll find him.
I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
Maybe they swiped another boat.
I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
I don't feel right.
You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically modified foods now.
I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
If I've been gone for 27 years...
Then why do you still look so young?
I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
Hey.
All this time and she's still after me.
I guess I understand why.
That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
What?
You have a problem.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So, maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
You can't do that.
But the barn can.
I don't know where the barn is.
Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
Why should I trust you, Crocker?
'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
Damn it, Vince.
I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
So, you didn't free Arla?
Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
What are you talking about?
Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
Think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
Any idea where we can find Vince?
Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
You did all this for him?
I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
No.
Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
Duke?
Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
No.
Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
You used me to bring James to her.
Yahtzee.
I thought you wanted the troubles to stop.
I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
Either of you.
Hey!
Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
Then I'm going with you.
Me too.
You're not leaving me out here again.
You're not going in.
How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
I will.
Ready?
What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
Love what Howard's done with the place.
What is this thing?
Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
Must be this place.
Whatever's going on with the troubles with Haven, this...
Barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
It solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
What just happened?
Huh.
That's me.
No.
That's Sarah.
Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
Are we in the 1950s?
The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So, don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
Don't touch it.
Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
Guess some things never change.
Will you quit breathing down my neck?
You're shaking.
Stop shaking.
It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
Hurry up.
Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
Good.
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
It did nothing.
It's completely intact.
This old barn should be splinters.
This is more than a barn.
Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
But who will take care of your son?
I took him somewhere safe.
Was he with his father?
James's father?
He's not even born yet.
Not even born?
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
That you showed to us.
You're not taking Audrey away.
Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
How do we know that memory's even real?
How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
I don't like that.
Okay, so, he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find...
To find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
He's here.
James!
James!
Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
Who are you?
Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
I've always wondered who you were.
This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
What are you talking about?
When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "there's gotta be another way."
What did you find out?
What's the other way?
Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
But Audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
Nathan?
Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
Talk to who?
I saw James.
I need to know what's going on in there.
Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a lking purse.
Hey!
Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
How'd you find the barn?
We had every member of the guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
She's already gone in.
Good.
Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your troubles before anyone touches me.
This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
I'm not here because of Nathan.
Right.
When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
He'd rather have Audrey.
I told you, shut up!
Both you and Nathan...
In love with a woman neither of you can have.
It's almost... sad.
He's your son, isn't he?
Our son.
Why didn't you tell me?
Not exactly sure how that conversation would have gone.
I guess it was a way to be with you.
I know that... that sounds crazy.
No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if I do disappear,
I have some proof that I existed.
You are not disappearing.
Not this time.
What did James tell you?
James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks... that somehow killing him ends the troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
Okay.
He's right there.
Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
Where's Arla?
I want to see her.
James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
I want to talk to Arla!
James.
James, stop.
Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
You want to see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
Oh!
Really, Vince?
Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
Because I want the troubles to end.
I want this to end!
Nobody wants the troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
We tried before.
Doesn't mean we can't try again!
Vince.
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
Take the men and go.
But...
Guns are not gonna solve this, Kirk.
Go home.
Yes, sir.
What?
Why are you listening to him?
'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
You're in the guard.
They work for me.
Always have.
That explains a few things.
Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
It'll be her choice.
I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
Leave now, Jordan.
So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
I appreciate that.
In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
James wants to see you.
I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
Troubles don't work in here.
What happened to you?
After you died, okay, my trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-I can live inside the skin of other people.
Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
Babe, I...
I did it for you.
Don't touch me!
I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
Aah!
- Ruined everything!
- No!
No!
Hey!
This is your fault!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
The barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
Arla lied.
Yeah.
You didn't kill me.
No.
Why would...
why would I want to kill you?
'Cause then the troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
Why would killing you...
why would that end the troubles?
Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
What?
But you're not Lucy anymore.
We just met, so you don't love me.
Hey...
Who do you love, Audrey?
Ready to go?
Why?
That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's James?
Healing.
That's what you wanted.
No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
Why?
Why do I belong here?
Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
Recharge?
Recharge with what?
Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the troubles again.
Am I even human?
Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
So, I'm...
I'm troubled then.
No.
Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
It does seem that way.
Yes.
There's gotta be another way.
I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really should go now.
Wait.
I need to say good-bye.
What did James say?
He was wrong.
Killing him... it won't work.
Good-bye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
I got it.
Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me out of there.
I thought this might be easier this time, but... it's not.
Bye, Audrey.
Goodbye, Vince.
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but... you know me.
I like the challenge.
I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
Parker, if we...
No.
This is not good-bye.
- Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
I am gonna die before I let you go.
I know.
Duke...
Audrey!
Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
I promise, Audrey.
Audrey, don't do this.
27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good-bye.
We're not letting her go in there.
Yes, we are.
Listen.
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
You're in love with her too.
Yeah.
Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
Audrey, stop!
I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
Audrey!
Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!
- Previously on haven...
If i go into that barn when the hunter meteor storm hits,
The troubles disappear, but then so do i.
- The guard wants audrey in the barn tomorrow.
- Audrey is going in that barn over my dead body.
- Tell me about sarah.
- You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath you're always somehow the same.
- There's a skinwalker in haven?
- We discovered the skinwalker was stealing
Parts of women's faces, building a custom model.
Someone special.
- Arla cogan?
- Skinwalker's building the colorado kid's wife.
- You can't stop the troubles.
Only audrey can.
- There is another way.
- Tell me about this other way, i'll let you go.
- Lucy said she'd bring james and i into the barn with her.
- So, lucy left you behind.
- You take me to james,
And you won't ever have to worry about me again.
- What makes you think that i'm gonna let you near my son?
- Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
- Where do you want to go, james?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be arla that did this.
- She's got audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If audrey goes in...
- Troubles are gone.
- That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have
Just lost audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the troubles stop?
- Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
- No.
- Which means that the troubles are still here.
That means that audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if arla put a gun to audrey's head,
And she had to lead her somewhere,
Where would she take her?
Where?
- I--
Parker and i were just talking
About where the other audrey lost her memories,
The field with the imprint in it.
- Yeah...
- Like a building had been there.
- Out at kick 'em jenny neck.
- Yeah.
- Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
- I don't know what kind of relationship
You've had with my son.
- We're married.
We're in love.
- Till i tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
- Shh.
White-Breasted nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, audrey.
- Agent howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
- Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
- No, you'll take us there.
- Ah.
You must be arla.
I just left james cogan at haven joe's bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
say hi to him on his new cell phone.
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
james, baby.
It's me.
- I want to talk to him.
- I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
- I can't wait to see you too, baby.
- I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, i will shoot you dead.
- Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May i offer you some tea?
- Who the hell are you?
- Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
- In a barn?
- Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
- How did that get here?
- It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
- Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the troubles end for 27 years?
- Not that simple.
If it was, i could just pick you up and throw you in.
- No.
You couldn't.
- You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the troubles to end for 27 years.
- Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
- You'll be back to haven.
- Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
- Yes.
- But i don't want audrey to die.
- Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
- What?
I can just go?
- Yes.
But know this, audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible,
Trying to stay,
It will continue to fall faster and faster,
Until the town and everyone you love in it
Have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
- Audrey!
- Over here!
- You're okay.
- How did you get here?
- Duke stole a boat.
- Borrowed.
Where's aria?
- She's gone.
But howard, he--
The barn is gone.
I gotta find arla.
She has my son.
- I'm--I'm sure that it's me,
But i thought the meteors are supposed to pass over haven.
Wha--
Why is it hitting us?
- Because i won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster
Until i find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
- Found him yet?
- Vince.
You got that two-Ton jack?
A guy on barkhouse drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
- The hunter storm has begun.
Uh, you don't wanna know.
- Yeah, i do.
Oh...
- I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had arla the skinwalker tied up,
But dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
- Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
- Oh, maybe you're right.
- Sorry, dave.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- My skiff was abandoned at south down docks.
James and arla left it.
- Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
- He said james was really sick,
That he's getting worse and worse.
- If the barn kept him alive,
Maybe he can't leave it.
- The whole town is getting bombarded.
- Put out an apb.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors--We'll find him.
- I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
Maybe they swiped another boat.
- I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
- Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
- I don't feel right.
- You're probably just not used to all the modern bugs.
It's all genetically modified foods now.
i hope so.
I can't believe i've been gone for so long.
- Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
- If i've been gone for 27 years...
Then why do you still look so young?
- I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here
Before your mother finds us.
- Hey.
- All this time and she's still after me.
i guess i understand why.
- That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, baby.
What?
- You have a problem.
I hear your james is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think i know?
Audrey parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-Sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds james.
So, maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want james better, right?
- You can't do that.
- But the barn can.
- I don't know where the barn is.
- Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save james just like she did before.
- Why should i trust you, crocker?
- 'Cause i know that audrey has to go in the barn.
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring james.
I'll take care of the rest.
- Damn it, vince.
I know what vince told you, but he lied, dwight.
- So, you didn't free aria?
- Not really the point.
Vince knows that i'll try to keep audrey out of the barn,
And that's why he tied me up.
- So, vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked audrey.
- He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
- What are you talking about?
- Vince and i tried to keep sarah
Out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for audrey to just keep going back in.
Think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on,
Deal with the damn troubles,
And not just keep using that poor girl as a band-Aid.
- Any idea where we can find vince?
- Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
- I told you audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better,
And then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
- You did all this for him?
- I did it for us.
You ever been in love, crocker?
- No.
- Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
- Duke?
- Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn,
Make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
- No.
- Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow nathan's brains out.
- No.
You won't.
Remember when you were tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
- You used me to bring james to her.
- Yahtzee.
- I thought you wanted the troubles to stop.
- I do.
I want audrey to stick around too.
It seems your james is the only one who knows
How to make both those things happen.
- James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
- Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
- Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
- Howard said this barn only comes when i'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when i'm ready to leave.
And i'm not ready to leave...
Either of you.
- Hey!
- Nathan, i have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
- Then i'm going with you.
- Me too.
- You're not leaving me out here again.
- You're not going in.
- How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
- I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here
And watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
- I will.
- Ready?
- What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
- Love what howard's done with the place.
- What is this thing?
- Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
- Must be this place.
- Whatever's going on with the troubles with haven,
This...
Barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
It solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
- What just happened?
- That's me.
- No.
That's sarah.
- Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
- Are we in the 1950s?
- The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So, don't drop it, vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
- Don't touch it.
- Focus.
- Is that vince and dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
- Guess some things never change.
- Will you quit breathing down my neck?
- You're shaking.
Stop shaking.
- It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
- Hurry up.
- Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of sarah's memories?
- Good.
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
It did nothing.
- It's completely intact.
- This old barn should be splinters.
- This is more than a barn.
- Well, thank you for trying.
But i guess i have to go.
- But who will take care of your son?
- I took him somewhere safe.
- Was he with his father?
- James's father?
He's not even born yet.
- Not even born?
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe howard overheard us.
- You're right, audrey.
That was sarah's memory.
- That you showed to us.
- You're not taking audrey away.
- Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what i was trying to show you.
- How do we know that memory's even real?
- How 'bout i show you a memory of sarah's
That you know is real, nathan?
- I don't like that.
- Okay, so, he just said that it would be one of sarah's memories
That you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find--
To find duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
- Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, i don't think james is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
- Oh, my god.
- I didn't know if i was ever coming back.
- He's here.
James!
James!
- Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
- Who are you?
- Nathan.
Nathan wuornos.
I'm your father.
- I've always wondered who you were.
- This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural
Steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and i.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
- Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
- What are you talking about?
- When i came to haven to find my mother sarah,
I found lucy instead.
She was frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And i said, "there's gotta be another way."
- What did you find out?
What's the other way?
- Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
- But audr--
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
- The day i was supposed to leave haven,
Somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
- Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
- Well, maybe you don't know your audrey
As well as you think.
Nathan?
- Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to--
- Talk to who?
- I saw james.
- I need to know what's going on in there.
- Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
- You love audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
- Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.
Hey!
- Relax, crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
- How'd you find the barn?
- We had every member of the guard looking for it.
Now where is parker?
- She's inside.
- Did i say you could speak?
- She's already gone in.
Good.
- Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure audrey's still in there when it leaves.
- If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your troubles
Before anyone touches me.
- This isn't about you, duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
- Hell hath no fury, eh, jordan?
- I'm not here because of nathan.
- Right.
- When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
- He'd rather have audrey.
- I told you, shut up!
- Both you and nathan...
In love with a woman neither of you can have.
It's almost...sad.
- He's your son, isn't he?
- Our son.
- Why didn't you tell me?
not exactly sure
How that conversation would have gone.
I guess it was a way to be with you.
I know that--
That sounds crazy.
- No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if i do disappear,
I have some proof that i existed.
- You are not disappearing.
Not this time.
- What did james tell you?
- James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks...
That somehow killing him ends the troubles.
We need to find james.
Figure out what really happened to him.
- Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
- Okay.
He's right there.
- Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
- Where's aria?
I want to see her.
- James, there are things about arla that you do not know.
- I want to talk to arla!
- James.
- James, stop.
- Ah...
okay, that hurt.
- You want to see arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
Really, vince?
Oh, no.
- They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him,
But i can't let him stop audrey.
- He wants audrey to go back into the barn.
- Because i want the troubles to end.
I want this to end!
- Nobody wants the troubles to end more than i do.
My little girl died because of them,
But this can't keep happening over and over.
- Vincent, what if audrey can find a way to change things?
- We tried before.
- Doesn't mean we can't try again!
- Vince.
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
- Take the men and go.
- But--
- Guns are not gonna solve this, kirk.
Go home.
- Yes, sir.
- What?
Why are you listening to him?
- 'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
- You're in the guard.
- They work for me.
Always have.
- That explains a few things.
- Vince, please.
You're going to make sure audrey goes away, right?
- It'll be her choice.
- I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
- Leave now, jordan.
- So, what does this mean for us, vince?
That tattoo--
- I'm not gonna kill you, duke.
- I appreciate that.
- In fact, i'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
- James wants to see you.
- I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
- Troubles don't work in here.
What happened to you?
- After you died, okay, my trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But i-I can live inside the skin of other people.
- Tell him, arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
- You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
- Babe, i-- I did it for you.
- Don't touch me!
- I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
- You killed--What?
Oh, my god!
- Ruined everything!
- No!
No!
- Hey!
- This is your fault!
- You okay?
- Yeah, i'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
The barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
- Arla lied.
- Yeah.
- You didn't kill me.
- No.
Why would-- Why would i want to kill you?
- 'Cause then the troubles...
But then i guess that didn't happen, did it?
- Why would killing you-- Why would that end the troubles?
- Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved
Was the only way to end the troubles.
Not--Not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true haven again.
- What?
- But you're not lucy anymore.
We just met, so you don't love me.
- Hey...
- Who do you love, audrey?
- Ready to go?
- Why?
- That meteor storm is about to pound haven from the face--
- I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's james?
- Healing.
That's what you wanted.
- No, i want him to have a life.
The life that i can't have.
- That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
- Why?
Why do i belong here?
- Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
But after 27 years,
That energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
- Recharge?
Recharge with what?
- Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn
And stop the troubles again.
- Am i even human?
- Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
- So, i'm-- I'm troubled then.
- No.
- Then why do i need to kill the man i love to end all this?
Am i being punished?
- It does seem that way.
Yes.
- There's gotta be another way.
- I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really should go now.
- Wait.
I need to say good-Bye.
- What did james say?
- He was wrong.
Killing him...
It won't work.
Good-Bye, dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
- I got it.
- Audrey,
You don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
- No, dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me out of there.
- I thought this might be easier this time, but...
It's not.
Bye, audrey.
- Good-Bye, vince.
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
- It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but...
You know me.
I like the challenge.
- I'm sorry i won't remember you when i come back.
Especially colorado.
- Parker, if we--
No.
This is not good-Bye.
Take me with you.
- No.
Nathan?
Nathan, i won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
- I am gonna die before i let you go.
- I know.
Duke...
- Audrey!
- Make sure nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, duke.
- I promise, audrey.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- 27 years, nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good-Bye.
- We're not letting her go in there.
- Yes, we are.
Listen.
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town,
And it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
- You're in love with her too.
- Yeah.
- Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
- Audrey, stop!
- I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
- That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
- They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
- Get her, duke.
Go, save her.
- Audrey!
- Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!
Previously on Haven...
If I go into that barn when the Hunter meteor storm hits, the Troubles disappear, but then so do I.
The Guard wants Audrey in the barn tomorrow.
Audrey's going in that barn over my dead body.
Tell me about Sarah.
You know, you always come back with a different name, but underneath, you're always somehow the same.
There's a skinwalker in Haven?
We discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, building a custom model;
someone special.
Arla Cogan?
Skinwalker's building the Colorado Kid's wife.
You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.
There is another way.
Tell me about this other way, I'll let you go.
Lucy said she'd bring James and I into the barn with her.
So, Lucy left you behind.
You take me to James, and you won't ever have to worry about me again.
What makes you think that I'm gonna let you near my son?
Because if you don't, everyone you love will die.
Where do you wanna go, James?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.
Danny!
Damn it.
Had to be Arla that did this.
She's got Audrey now.
Okay, meteor storm started last night.
That means they gotta be looking for that damn barn.
If Audrey goes in...
Troubles are gone.
That's what you're thinking?
You're not worried that we might have just lost Audrey forever?
You're thinking that today might be the day the Troubles stop?
Hey, wait!
Did you feel that?
No.
Which means that the Troubles are still here.
That means that Audrey hasn't gone in the barn yet.
Come on.
They're looking for the barn, right?
Now, if Arla put a gun to Audrey's head, and she had to lead her somewhere, where would she take her?
Where?
I...
Parker and I were just talking about where the other Audrey lost her memories, a field with the imprint in it.
- Yeah, okay.
- Like a building had been there.
- Out at Kick 'Em Jenny Neck.
- Yeah.
Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.
If someone hadn't stolen it.
- Arla.
- Damn it!
I don't know what kind of relationship you had with my son.
We're married.
We're in love.
Till I tell him that you're a psycho serial killer.
Shh.
White-Breasted Nuthatch.
Likes to climb, not fly.
Odd bird.
Hello, Audrey.
Agent Howard.
Or whoever the hell you are.
Looking for the barn, right?
Come on.
I'll take you there.
No, you'll take us there.
Ah.
You must be Arla.
I just left James Cogan at Haven Joe's Bakery.
- He's alive?
Is he okay?
- Confused.
Had no idea how much time had passed.
Kept wondering what happened to pay phones.
He's still there.
Go to him.
Here.
Say hi to him on his new cellphone.
- James.
- Arla, is that you?
Ah...
James, baby. it's me.
I wanna talk to him.
I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.
I can't wait to see you too, baby.
I don't need you anymore.
If you make one move to follow me, I will shoot you dead.
Come.
We'll chat a bit.
May I offer you some tea?
Who the hell are you?
Think of me as your ride.
I drop you off, and then when the time is right,
I pick you up.
In a barn?
Yes.
Look.
Well, it's quite a bit more than a barn.
- How did that get here?
- It comes whenever you're looking for it.
It comes when you're ready.
Okay, so that's it?
I go into the barn, and then the Troubles end for 27 years?
Mm...
Not that simple.
If it was, I could just pick you up and throw you in.
No.
You couldn't.
You have to want to go in.
You have to want to go away.
That's what allows the Troubles to end for 27 years.
Well, then, see, that's where we have a problem, Morpheus.
I don't want to go away.
You'll be back to Haven.
Yeah, but as somebody else, right?
Audrey Parker goes away.
Audrey...
Dies.
Yes.
But I don't want Audrey to die.
Okay.
Go and try to figure out the way to stay.
What?
I can just go?
Yes.
But know this, Audrey.
The sky is starting to fall.
While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
Now, go.
Your friends are here.
- Audrey!
- Over here!
You're okay.
How did you get here?
Duke stole a boat.
Borrowed.
Where's Arla?
She's gone, but Howard, he...
The barn is gone.
I gotta find Arla.
She has my son.
I'm...
I'm sure that it's me, but I thought the meteors are supposed to pass over Haven.
Wha...
Why is it hitting us?
Because I won't go in the barn.
And they're gonna come faster and faster until I find my son and he tells us how to stop this.
Found him yet?
Vince.
You got that 2-ton Jack?
A guy on Barkhouse Drive is trapped under a wall.
Said his house exploded.
The Hunter Storm has begun.
Uh, you don't wanna know.
Yeah, I do.
Oh...
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.
Yesterday, we had Arla the skinwalker tied up, but Dave hit me over the head and set her free.
It's too dangerous right now.
Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?
Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk.
Let him out.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Sorry, Dave.
- All right.
- Thanks.
My skiff was abandoned at South Down Docks.
James and Arla left it.
Ah...
Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.
He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.
If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
The whole town is getting bombarded.
I'll put out an APB.
Contact all the hospitals, doctors...
we'll find him.
I'm gonna check the security cameras at the docks.
You know, maybe they swiped another boat.
I'm sorry, folks, this entrance is closed off.
Okay.
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.
Ah...
I don't feel right.
You're probably just not used to all the modem bugs.
It's all genetically-modified foods now.
Ah...
I hope so.
I can't believe I've been gone for so long.
Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.
Things aren't so different.
- Arla.
- Yeah?
If I've been gone for 27 years, then... why do you still look so young?
I stayed young for you, silly.
Now hush.
We have to get you well so we can get you outta here before your mother finds us.
Hey.
All this time and she's still after me.
I guess I understand why.
That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.
I won't let her hurt you again.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
- What?
- You have a prob/em.
I hear your James is sick.
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?
Audrey Parker's running around looking for you.
- She's not in the barn?
- No.
You see, you can tell by the car-sized rocks falling from the sky.
And she's not going in until she finds James.
So maybe there's a way we can both get what we need.
You want James better, right?
You can't do that.
But the barn can.
I don't know where the barn is.
Audrey can summon the barn.
And she'll do it to save James just like she did before.
Why should I trust you, Crocker?
'Cause I know that Audrey has to go in the barn.
I'm tired of living in a disaster movie.
Troubles have to stop.
You just meet me and bring James.
I'll take care of the rest.
Damn it, Vince.
I know what Vince told you, but he lied, Dwight.
- So, you didn't free Arla?
- Not really the point.
Vince knows that I'll try to keep Audrey out of the barn, and that's why he tied me up.
So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.
He loves her.
But he says he has to be practical.
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.
What are you talking about?
Vince and I tried to keep Sarah out of the barn once before.
Let's just say it didn't work.
Vince decided there and then that the best thing for everyone is for Audrey to just keep going back in.
I think we have to break the damn cycle.
We have to face the situation head on, deal with the damn Troubles, and not just keep using that poor girl as a band-aid.
Any idea where we can find Vince?
Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.
I told you Audrey could bring the barn.
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.
What's wrong with him?
I dunno.
But this barn saved him last time.
We just have to get him better, and then we'll figure it out.
Right, baby?
Just like we always do, huh?
You'll be okay.
Okay.
You did all this for him?
I did it for us.
You ever been in love, Crocker?
No.
Well, if you had, then you'd understand.
Duke?
Don't move.
Crocker, get their guns.
You're gonna take him inside of the barn, make him better, and then bring him back out to me.
No.
Oh, you will.
And by the way, if you don't come back this time...
I'll blow Nathan's brains out.
No.
You won't.
Remember when you were Tommy?
Gave me that gun with no bullets in it?
I didn't forget that.
You used me to bring James to her.
Yahtzee.
I thought you wanted the Troubles to stop?
I do.
I want Audrey to stick around too.
It seems your James is the only one who knows how to make both those things happen.
James?
James.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
It's your mother.
He's not okay.
He's fading.
Bring him into the barn.
It can save his life.
Parker, if you go in there, you might never come out.
Howard said this barn only comes when I'm ready.
Maybe it only disappears when I'm ready to leave.
And I'm not ready to leave...
either of you.
Hey!
Nathan, I have to go after him.
He's my only chance.
Then I'm going with you.
Me too.
You're not leaving me out here again.
You're not going in.
How are you gonna stop me once you're inside the barn?
I guess someone's gonna have to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.
Nathan...
You make sure she comes back out.
I will.
Ready?
What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.
Love what Howard's done with the place.
What is this thing?
Parker...
I can feel.
My skin, the air, everything.
Must be this place.
Whatever's going on with the Troubles with Haven, this... barn is at the center of it.
We need to take it out.
Solves all our problems.
You can't get trapped in here if we blow it up.
What just happened?
Huh?
That's me.
No.
That's Sarah.
Sarah?
I don't think they can see us.
Are we in the 1950s?
The barn transported us back in time?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So don't drop it, Vincent.
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.
Focus.
Don't touch it.
Focus.
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.
Guess some things never change.
- Will you quit breathing down my neck?
- Well, you're shaking.
Stop shaking.
It's like we're watching a scene from the past.
Hurry UP-
- Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?
Good.
Come, come!
Go, go, go, go, go!
It did nothing.
It's completely intact.
This old barn should be splinters.
This is more than a barn.
Well, thank you for trying.
But I guess I have to go.
- But who will take care of your son?
- I took him somewhere safe.
Was he with his father?
James's father?
He's not even born yet.
Not even born?
We were talking about blowing up the barn earlier.
Maybe Howard overheard us.
You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.
That you showed to us.
- You're not taking Audrey away.
- Oh, it can't be stopped.
That's what I was trying to show you.
How do we know that memory's even real?
How 'bout I show you a memory of Sarah's that you know is real, Nathan?
I don't like that.
Okay, so he just said that it would be one of Sarah's memories that you remember, which means it's gotta be 1955.
That's when you went back in time to find... to find Duke, right?
Don't you have a jacket like that?
Yeah.
That's weird.
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.
Parker...
Audrey, wait.
Oh... my...
God.
I didn't know if I was ever coming back.
He's here.
James!
James!
Parker?
Parker!
Parker!
What the hell is going on?
Audrey.
Who are you?
Nathan.
Nathan Wuornos.
I'm your father.
Always wondered who you were.
This would be weird even if we weren't meeting in a giant, supernatural steam room.
We've been looking for you.
Audrey and I.
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?
Again?
Kill her son to save herself.
What are you talking about?
When I came to Haven to find my mother Sarah,
I found Lucy instead.
She was... frantic.
She'd just found out that she was about to disappear.
And I said, "There's gotta be another way."
What did you find out?
What's the other way?
Me.
My death was the only thing that could keep her out of the barn.
But Audr...
Lucy never would've hurt you, not even to save herself.
The day I was supposed to leave Haven, somebody snuck up and bashed me in the back of the head.
Arla found out it was my mom.
Arla lied.
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.
Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey as well as you think.
Nathan?
Parker.
Good.
You have to talk to...
Talk to who?
I saw James.
I need to know what's going on in there.
Settle down.
You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.
You love Audrey, don't you?
At least admit it to yourself.
Shut up.
I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.
Hey!
Relax, Crocker.
If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.
How'd you find the barn?
We had every member of the Guard looking for it.
Now where is Parker?
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?
She's already gone in.
Good.
Think we're gonna wait here with you.
Make sure Audrey's still in there when it leaves.
If any of you come for this gun,
I'll separate at least three of you from your Troubles before anyone touches me.
This isn't about you, Duke.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.
Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?
I'm not here because of Nathan.
Right.
When that barn disappears, my Trouble goes with it.
I'll be able to touch people, be touched.
I just want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.
- He'd rather have Audrey.
- I told you, shut up!
Both you and Nathan... in love with a woman neither of you can have.
Um!
it's almost... sad.
He's your son, isn't he?
Our son.
Why didn't you tell me?
Ah...
Not exactly sure how that conversation would've gone.
I guess it was a way to...
be with you.
I know that... sounds crazy.
No.
It doesn't.
Part of me's glad.
At least this way, if I do disappear, I have some proof that I existed.
You're not disappearing.
Not this time.
What did James tell you?
James thinks he's the answer.
He thinks... that somehow killing him ends the Troubles.
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.
Howard?
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.
I'm not making my choice until you show me my son.
Okay.
He's right there.
Oh...
James.
It's so good to finally meet you.
Where's Arla?
I wanna see her.
James, there are things about Arla that you do not know.
- I want to talk to Arla!
- James...
- James, stop.
- Ah...
Okay, that hurt.
You wanna see Arla?
All right.
I'll go bring her to you.
Oh!
Ah...
Really, Vince?
Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.
I don't want to hurt him, but I can't let him stop Audrey.
He wants Audrey to go back into the barn.
Because I want the Troubles to end.
I want this to end!
Nobody wants the Troubles to end more than I do.
My little girl died because of them, but this can't keep happening over and over.
Vincent, what if Audrey can find a way to change things?
- We tried before.
- Doesn't mean we can't try again!
Vince?
Look, get outta here before you get hurt.
Take the men and go.
- But...
- Guns are not gonna solve this, Kirk.
Go home.
Yes, sir.
What?
Why are you listening to him?
'Cause he's the boss.
We're leaving.
You're in the Guard.
They work for me.
Always have.
That explains a few things.
Vince, please.
You're going to make sure Audrey goes away, right?
- It'll be her choice.
- I've lost too much.
I won't let it all be for nothing.
Leave now, Jordan.
So, what does this mean for us, Vince?
That tattoo...
- I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
- I appreciate that.
In fact, I'm the reason the others never went after you.
And believe me, they wanted to.
James wants to see you.
I thought he might.
James.
Hush, it's all right.
What?
What's wrong?
Troubles don't work in here.
What happened to you?
After you died, okay, my Trouble started.
And my skin fell off.
But I-| can live inside the skin of other people.
Tell him, Arla.
Tell him how many women you murdered to get that skin.
You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?
Babe, I...
I did it for you.
Don't touch me!
I waited for you.
I killed for you.
I killed for us!
You killed... what?
Oh, my God!
- Ruined everything!
- Don't!
No!
Hey!
Oh!
This is your fault!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life.
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.
Well, the barn saved you last time.
It'll fix you again.
- Arla lied.
- Yeah.
You didn't kill me.
No.
Why would...
why would I wanna kill you?
'Cause then the Troubles...
But then I guess that didn't happen, did it?
Why would killing you...
why would that end the Troubles?
Because you loved me.
L-Lucy said that killing someone she loved was the only way to end the Troubles.
Not... not just for 27 years, but forever.
Haven would be a true Haven again.
What?
- But you're not Lucy anymore.
- Um...
But we just met, so you don't love me.
_ Hey...
Who do you love, Audrey?
Ready to 9°?
Why?
That meteor storm is about to pound Haven from the face...
I'm not talking about the meteor storm.
I'm talking about me.
My choices.
Where's James?
Healing.
That's what you wanted.
No, I want him to have a life.
The life that I can't have.
That's impossible.
He belongs here now, like his mother.
Why?
Why do I belong here?
Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.
When you're in it, your energy keeps the Troubles at bay.
But after 27 years, that energy starts to run out.
Troubles start again.
So, you have to come out and recharge.
Recharge?
Recharge with what?
Love.
It energizes you so you can go back into the barn and stop the Troubles again.
Am I even human?
Audrey...
That's your problem.
You are very, very human.
So, I'm...
I'm Troubled then.
No.
Then why do I need to kill the man I love to end all this?
Am I being punished?
It does seem that way.
Yes.
There's gotta be another way.
I'm sorry.
There are only two ways this ends.
One stops the Trouble for 27 years, the other...
Forever.
We really... should go now.
Wait.
I need to say goodbye.
What did James say?
He was wrong.
Killing him... it won't work.
Goodbye, Dwight.
I'm sorry about the mess.
I got it.
Audrey, you don't have to go away.
There are other things we can try.
No, Dave.
Innocent people will not die to keep me outta there.
I thought this might be easier this time, but... it's not.
Bye, Audrey.
Goodbye, Vince.
Duke...
You have always been so good to me.
It was easy.
It actually wasn't, but... you know me:
I like the challenge.
I'm sorry I won't remember you when I come back.
Especially Colorado.
Parker, if we...
No.
This is not goodbye.
Take me with you.
No.
Nathan?
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?
I'll be with our son.
I am gonna die before I let you go.
I know.
Duke...
Audrey!
Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.
Promise me.
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.
- I promise, Audrey.
- Audrey, don't do this.
27 years, Nathan.
Then we'll get to do it all over again.
Good bye.
- We're not lettin' her go in there.
- Yes, we are.
Listen!
She's trying to help all these people.
She's trying to help this town, and it is her choice.
It's not yours.
It's not mine.
I hate it.
But it's still her choice.
You're in love with her too.
Yeah.
Then how can you let her go?
Look at her.
Look at her!
Audrey, stop!
I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.
That was made clear.
What about hurting you?
They're not stopping.
They're supposed to stop.
Get her, Duke.
Go, save her.
Audrey!
Audrey.
Audrey!
Audrey!

There was a girl who was raped ...
Tortured and then murdered ... In the basement of this building.

His parents paid the city ​​for what it concealed.
Why parents would do something like that?
I do not know, but it worked right?
There is no research real, the case was closed ...
This building has been closed for 30 years.
Closed and desolate.

DAY29
Oh, here.
Thank you.
When this list.
When I read the article ...
About you were doing a story the murders of Town Creek ...
And my sister Amber.
Wanted you to have the newspaper.
Even ...
Even I have nightmares.
We were so young ...
My sister and I just we got a year But we were never really close.
She always thought my parents loved me more than her.
He hated the fact that I had blonde hair.
Whenever something was to do with it ...
Well ...
I did well in school.
It was popular among my friends.
But Amber was the opposite.
She was always alone.
He found problems wherever they may be.
One day, our father ...
Amber and Henry ...
They were arguing.
Zoey had been murdered.
Dad accused Henry of having something to do with it.
I thought I was crazy.
Only crazy.
No one ...
He could get away from him.
We packed our stuff and left the city.
Even falsify our death For anyone to come and get us.
Are they married?
Amber fell in love much of it.
But it was my husband.
She said they had a connection of souls.
I began to hate her.
The hated, despised everything he did.
So ...
She was dead, lying in the morgue.
I went to see her, give my last respects.
And I saw that the Doctor was sodomizándola.
And I never said anything, nobody ...
About that.
So far ...
See?
It was not until five years ago ...
After Henry died, was packing her things ...
And I found her diary.
When I read ...
I was wrong.
I was wrong!
Very wrong!
That's why I come back here.
To close this.
By Amber.
All the things you hear ...
Things I could never imagine.
I knew something was not OK, but the satanic cult ...
When he dragged her.
He raped her.
And the terrible my ...
Fear horrible ...
Amber had, was to fall themselves by their hands of him.
I was wrong!
I was wrong!
My father told me that the girl was involved with a satanic cult ...
They promised the immortality or something.
- Never heard that.
- Oh yeah, yeah!
His family was very influential with the Minister ...
They covered everything.
That was long ago.
There can be no connection.
DAY30 In my research I came to understand why or Haili did that caused those things ... since it was impossible to speak with it, and about Amber ...
Finally ... she can rest.
We finally ended.
And that concludes my report.
If!

I'm here to see Grigore.
I'm expected.
Go on out the back.
Whoa.
Hell of a warm welcome, making me wait for you outside.
What do you want?
Well, you said if I ever had more.
AB negative.
Only one in a hundred.
Is that supposed to make it taste better?
Rare is always valuable.
Isn't that what the people say?
People say a lot of stupid things.
Thank you.
Don't snort it all at once.
You know, for such a rare blood type, you have little trouble obtaining it.
I guess.
That's what makes me your source.
My friends here believe you are the source.
They can taste that stuff in your blood.
If that's true, why buy the cow when you can drink the blood for free, hm?
"NIGHTBREAKERS
- VAMPIRE NATION"
Today marks the end of the myth.
Our new reality is that vampires live amongst us.
And I, Constantin Kovaks, have been named head of the
Department of Human Vampyre Relations in accordance with our government's wish to foster a genuine symbiotic situation.
When we reach this historic scientific conclusion, the synthetic blood will allow vampires and humans to finally live together in peace.
After years of unsuccessful coexistence, the Romanian government has made the unilateral decision to cast all vampires to Sector Five.
I find it outrageous that this could happen in this day and age.
We are now not only subjugating these people, but quarantining them into what amounts to a modern day internment camp, only one with horrific living conditions.
So let me ask you, how long before Sector Five becomes an outright concentration camp?
Hey, the sooner the better if you ask me.
The fact they even refer to these things as people is frankly offensive.
They're an affront to God and everything we stand for.
I don't think for one minute they wouldn't do the same to us if they had half a chance.
As long as people continue to think like you do, there will never be a lasting peace.
Now, I want you to listen to me, and listen good.
Humans and vampires will never live in peace.
It goes against the natural order of things.
Make no mistake, it's us or them.
Which side are you on?
Keep your id's out.
To the left. lD's out.
Right.
I had it.
I just had it.
There a problem?
-Yeah, my ID.
I just...
Well, no one gets in without ID.
- I know, I know.
I just...
Step out of line, please.
I've got it.
I take your trash twice a day.
I deserve your respect.
No one gets in without ID, so move along.
I said move along.
Ah, Lieutenant Derricks.
You look like you just spent an hour with my wife.
We've got a situation developing in Sector 5.
Clearly you do not know my wife.
I meant to say you look terrible.
Yeah, I got that.
- Palinka?
It's not even nine-thirty.
It's synthetic.
- Then what's the point?
Three vampires and one blood dealer wound up dead last night in Ferentari.
Anyone I know?
No.
Well, then it would seem the situation has resolved itself.
It looks like they were ripped to pieces.
This is making me reconsider my breakfast.
You know, whatever did this couldn't have been a normal vamp.
It sure as hell wasn't human.
Last Monday.
Last Thursday.
Same M.O., same district.
You're saying there's things out there worse than vampires?
We only have learned that vampires exist in the last ten years.
Who knows what else might be out there.
I'll wait.
No, no, come.
Detective Derricks, Lieutenant lnnes-Bunchley.
First from Scotland Yard.
I want him to ride along with you on this one.
Yeah, no.
- What, he's perfectly qualified.
I'm perfectly qualified.
No offense Bumcheese, but I need someone a little crazier.
Someone who won't flinch at this.
Harker.
Give me Harker and his team.
That's...
Oh, yes.
Harke r?
Yeah, the Vampirdzhiya.
Vampire hunters.
You know, the next attacks could be on someone you actually give a damn about.
Shit.
Okay.
Okay, take the savage.
But you're taking him as well.
Fine.
Alright.
Hey, freaky giant guy.
You're not even that big.
What are you, like two-eighty?
Two-ninety?
Fine.
You're probably more like three-ten.
Anyone ever tell you you talk too much?
Yeah, but I probably wasn't listening.
What was it you were saying about...
Hey.
Well, I'm glad you could join us, John.
Harker.
John's my toilet's name.
So what'd you do to piss off the big guy?
Would you believe it was over a sandwich?
Vampirdzhiya, right?
Am I pronouncing that right?
Well, I'm Lieutenant Derricks, and this is Lieutenant lnnes-Bumstead, and we're here...
What?
Sorry, in his what?
It's Bunchley. lnnes-Bunchley.
Anyway, we're here to offer you a way out of this hell hole.
Call it work release.
We know the Vampirdzhiya have certain skills.
You want us to hunt vampires.
Not exactly.
Something out there is already doing that.
So what do you want from us, then?
Well, I would like you to help me stop it.
Why would we want to do that?
Because it's not just blood suckers that are being killed.
It's because I can get you transferred back to America.
But mainly, because you're good at killing things.
It's what you do.
My sister, too.
Or no deal.
All right?
Told you.
Matter of time.
Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.
We done?
Couple of stops we need to make first.
We don't have time for this.
Actually, we do.
It won't be dark for another hour yet.
Which means it's still happy hour.
They got a point, bumbly.
You boys got this, right?
We cannot turn in an expense report for the nightclub Kama Sutra.
Reckon you owe me that for the past two years.
What can I get for you guys?
Whatever they want.
Uh, beer.
Round.
And, um...
So what are we doing here, Harker?
Please tell me the last member of your fabled bunch isn't a prostitute.
She's not a prostitute.
She's a dancer.
The hours are better.
So, tell me.
How's a cop from the East Coast end up in Eastern Europe?
Same way most Americans do.
Married a local.
How'd that work out?
Still here.
We definitely can't drink on duty, guys.
You got a lot to learn about being in Eastern Europe, Bumlick.
Bunchley.
lnnes-Bunchley.
- What?
To still being here.
Katya.
You went out for ice cream and it took you two years to come back?
What can I say?
I eat slow.
Champagne Room.
Save my seat.
The Champagne Room?
We can't expense that.
Foreplay.
Nice.
I like it.
Two years, Johnny.
You couldn't find a way of letting me know you were all right?
Or even alive?
A vamp could have killed you in there for all I know.
You keep the vamps separate, Kat.
You know that.
Listen to me.
I thought about you.
Not enough to write.
I couldn't write.
It might have lead 'em straight to you.
You had a phone call, Johnny.
Everyone gets a phone call.
Yeah, but how would I know you were safe after?
So what are you doing here now?
Making sure you are safe.
Look, I know things have been bad.
Bad is what things were like when you went in.
Things now, they're worse than ever.
I'm stuck here night after night, too scared to even go home at night.
Why didn't you just leave?
Get the hell out of Bucharest?
I knew I'd never see you again.
And you never woulda had a chance to slap me, right?
Not in the mood for a lap dance?
Bumbledor gave me one in the car.
Uh, he's more the kinda guy that would stay home with the wife.
Feel better?
Like new.
Kat's up to speed, so we're ready when you are.
What?
She's part of the crew?
Why else do you think we're here?
You know it's work.
You can expense that.
Let me guess, Harker family reunion.
When I heard you were out,
I had a sudden craving to see you.
Is that supposed to scare me?
It's okay.
Marius here, he's all talk.
Hardly put up a fight the last time we met.
Do you think we'll let you walk freely after what you did?
He served his time.
Now take a step back.
Killed my father.
You mean the sick bastard that turned you...
Show yourself in our district and we'll bleed you dry.
Yeah?
You come near me again.
And you'll what?
Sick your slut on me?
I'm sorry, what?
She didn't tell you.
Your girl has been making enemies since you left.
Keep talking, Marius.
I swear to God I will rip your head off and stick it right up your...
Okay, I'm a cop, so try to cool it on the death threats.
Keep working with him, and my kind will turn on you.
Derricks!
Derricks!
Bouncers are missing.
There's blood.
And I don't suppose you know anything about that?
You're ours, Harker.
You and your merry band.
Go.
You know I released you on one condition.
That leech just killed two people
We don't know that.
Hey, low-profile.
How's this for low-profile?
Semi-automatic, nine millimeter, hollow points.
Not bad.
Haven't told you the best part, mercury tips.
Mercury?
The vapor in the bulb.
- Yeah.
To them it's poison.
To us it's poison.
I thought it's always silver, vampires' weakness?
What do you think they called mercury back in the day?
Quicksilver.
Shoot 'em with enough of these, they'll boil out from the inside.
So what else you have in there?
- We should go.
Yeah, I'm driving.
Keys.
- What?
Great.
It seems Harker and his friends are back to their old tricks.
We should tell Nikolai.
Listen.
Aleksandr.
Hey, we're just here for information, not to get vampire blood on the hands.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You should know that those things in there, they don't care you're a cop.
To them, blood is blood.
Okay?
We need to speak to whoever's in charge.
Back of the line, bleeders.
This is official police business.
I know your people can't hear for crap, so let me try again.
You're not on the list.
I'd check again.
Didn't you read the sign outside?
No soliciting.
We're not selling Girl Scout cookies.
We just want to talk.
Surrender your weapons.
You won't be harmed, you have my word.
Don't trust him.
You force your way into our house at gunpoint with the Vampirdzhiya.
Give me a reason to trust you.
We're not giving up our guns.
Yeah we are.
Remember why we're here.
All of you.
Do it.
I think I prefer being in prison.
Just you.
Harker, too.
Trust me, he's better where I can keep an eye on him.
How old is this place?
Older than Bucuresti itself.
Older than the Kazikle Voyvoda.
Older than the Kazikle Voyvoda.
The "impaler Prince...
Vlad the Impaler.
And his Ordinul Draculya.
"Order of the Dragon...
Dracula?
So who does that make you, then?
I am Anghel.
I had the honor to serve during the Carpathian Campaign.
My father is six hundred years old.
Dude, you don't look a day over two-fifty.
You better have good reason for bringing humans here.
For bringing him here.
Three vampires were killed last night, torn limb from limb.
They were buying human blood on the black market.
The past week, there's been easily a dozen murders, both human and vampire.
Though, from the look on both your faces, this isn't news.
What isn't news to us, Detective, is that human police don't care about crimes against vampires,
but now that humans are also being targeted, here you are.
I believe the distribution of this black market blood has led to certain impurities.
I don't follow.
A contaminated blood sample has spread through our people not unlike one of your sexually transmitted diseases.
The infected appear to be turning into a primitive subspecies, acting only on their most primal urges, turning our genes against us.
Like some kind of retrovirus.
So, what are you saying exactly?
I think they're saying there's life-size vampire bats flying around Bucharest, sucking it dry.
I guess that's where I come in.
Vampire metabolism is already must faster than a human's, but these vampire bats, as you call them, their needs are much higher.
Their blood thirst, insatiable.
One of my own sons has gone missing.
I fear he has fallen into their ranks.
So how do we stop 'em?
You can't, human.
Oh, and you can?
We are somewhat limited by our nocturnal tendencies, but you can track these creatures during the day while they slumber.
Of course, they'll tear you apart if you do.
Yeah.
We'll take our chances.
We should work together.
What?
That is not what I signed up for.
You signed up to kill vampires, and as far as I can tell, these are about as pure vampire as they get.
I do not wish them killed.
You must understand we don't have any choice.
Nikolai will help you find them if you will help us try to save them.
Good luck, Detective Derricks.
It's not part of the deal.
We work alone.
Actually, you work for me now.
We don't need them.
Wait, is that you?
Fire of eighteen forty-seven.
Humans burnt down half the city.
That was the last time we revealed ourselves.
Jury's still out if things will be any different this time around.
Vanatorii Umane.
It's time.
Vanatorii Umane?
Human hunters.
Not all humans, just the ones you brought with you.
Don't worry, Detective.
They're off the clock.
Where's Marius?
Find him.
Found him.
I'm sorry.
I brought them here.
Get out!
Harke r!
Hey!
Hey!
Faster metabolism apparently means they die faster.
Nice.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
What are you doing?
He could lead us to the others.
Aleksandr?
That's not Aleksandr anymore.
Brother, we only want to help you.
No!
I told you we wanted him alive.
Tracking bullet.
You should have said so.
How do we track him?
- Equipment's back at the...
Where?
Your hide out?
No.
No.
We are not taking them back there.
Why not?
You already know where we live.
That's not the same and you know it.
The hell it's not.
If we're working together, we're working together.
Good thinking using that tracking bullet.
Good thinking using that tracking bullet.
I expected a bit more.
It's no six hundred-year old disco.
Looks like he's moving along Rahovei through Ferentari.
If he removes the tracking dart?
No, transmitters are already his blood stream.
Not bad.
At least you're bringing something to the table.
So, uh, who pays for all this?
We bought stock in SanguiTech.
Pharmaceutical company behind the synth blood?
We got in early.
And no, the irony's not lost on me.
So where are we with our guy?
He stopped moving somewhere here, in the sewers below the processing plant in Rahova.
That's where their colony must be.
When you say "colony," how many do you think there are?
Hard to say.
Well how many of you are missing?
Right, hard to say.
You still don't want us knowing how many of you there actually are.
You're still getting used to the idea that you know about us at all.
Let's just say there may be more of them out there.
A lot more.
Okay.
We should gear up, get back out.
Not until sunrise.
Not if you want to survive.
I guess patience isn't one of your virtues, Harker.
Well, it's definitely one of yours.
I mean, without us you'd be still sipping on cocktails waiting for someone else to find your brother for you.
Don't worry about it, leech.
They won't be the first vampires
I've enjoyed killing, just the ugliest.
Don't think I didn't see what happened back at the club.
You might not have killed Marius, but you may as well have.
Once this so-called alliance is over, you and I are going to discuss it.
Really?
Why wait?
Okay, okay.
We may have some time to kill, but let's not kill each other, yeah?
What?
He started it.
Some slumber party.
Did you think we slept upside-down, hanging from the rafters?
Those things'll kill you.
You really need to worry?
What happened to getting some rest?
I guess I'm just restless.
I can see that.
So your ex, what's the story there?
What makes you think there's a story?
She got sick a few years ago.
Doctors didn't give her long.
I was desperate.
I knew she'd say no, so I didn't give her a choice.
You had her turned?
I knew she'd object, so I did it while she slept.
She woke up a vampire.
She's out there somewhere.
You'll find her.
You know, the thing is, I wouldn't even know what to say to her if I did.
I'm sure you will.
That's real, isn't it?
Can I ask you something?
Why do you hate the vampires so much?
Is that a real question?
You could have left town, like so many others.
People shouldn't have to leave their own cities.
They shouldn't have to live in fear.
Are you frightened of me?
Yes.
Good.
Is this okay, us talking like this?
Like what?
You know, like a couple of people.
We are a couple of people.
No, I know.
That's not what I meant.
It's just...
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
What's it like out there?
If I didn't know better, I'd say your sister's flirting with Nikolai.
- What?
I'm sure they're just passing time.
Perfect.
I don't know about you, but I could use a shower.
You coming?
Derricks has involved the vampires.
They're moving on the sewers at sunrise.
Understood.
I'll make sure.
The signal stopped moving four hundred meters south by southwest.
Well, this is nice.
We got enough C-Four to take out half of Sector Five.
But, I'm sure it won't come to that.
Remember, we want Aleksandr alive.
I'll take the lead.
- Nikolai...
You can't see in the dark.
- That's why we have flashlights.
What am I here for, then?
Bitching, apparently.
Fine.
By all means.
A hundred meters this way.
I'm sorry.
I can smell them.
Means they can smell us, too.
From here on out, silence.
Flashlights off.
Harke r?
Wait.
My brother is in here.
Let me find him first.
What about the rest of them?
Plant your charges, but give me the detonator.
Come on.
Come on!
Okay, come on.
Okay, okay.
Go, go, 90-
Come on!
Go!
Go, go, go!
They're getting through!
Fire in the hole!
They're giving UP-
They'll be back, once they find another way around.
Okay, we get outta here while we still can.
No.
- No?
You saw the size of that colony.
There were hundreds of them.
This is our chance to wipe 'em all out at once.
He's right, Harker.
If we leave now, they'll move the colony before we get back.
We must detonate the explosives.
You're the one that dropped the damn thing.
You go get it.
Unless it wasn't an accident.
We don't need the detonator.
We just need someone to get close enough to blow one of the C-Four bricks.
Blowing one of the bricks will set off a chain reaction to take out the rest of them, too.
This has the biggest range.
Who's our best shot?
My eyesight is twice as sensitive as yours.
How do we even know you're gonna take the shot?
Harker?
- Just cover me.
How close you need to get?
- The door.
At that distance you're going to blow yourself up.
Let's just get him to the door.
I can't get a clean shot.
We need that detonator.
Let's clear a path.
Follow up on me.
Go.
Brother.
No.
Know what you're doing?
Everyone out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Andrei?
Harker, just go!
Something's blocking the door!
Anytime, Harker!
It's stuck!
Here!
Go!
She's gone.
They're all gone.
I couldn't save any of them.
Aleksandr is gone.
He gave his life for us.
That proves he died your brother and not one of those things.
You need to stop hurting yourself and cover up.
Harke r?
He's a dead man.
He will pay for what he did to Andrei, I promise.
But right now we need him alive.
Harke r!
You better lock him up somewhere I can't find him.
What is the meaning of this?
- You tell me.
Lieutenant?
He was waiting for us.
As we took out the colony, he was waiting to trap us in there with those creatures.
Vampires are a disease!
They have no business living amongst us.
It wasn't just the vampires, was it?
I was in there.
Please, please, please, please.
Get him out of here.
Okay.
Well, this will be an embarrassment to the department.
People are dead because of him!
I think we can both use one of these?
Someone must be responsible for the tainted blood.
Tainted blood?
The black market blood.
Some of it's tainted and infected with something that alters the vampires' DNA, turns them into these full-on monsters.
Damn blood dealer.
Now killing the infected won't stop others from getting sick or- or changing.
We need to find the source.
And who knows if that was even the only colony.
Colony?
There are colonies?
Unless the poor bastard downstairs is the last.
You brought one here?
The examination room, yeah.
I gotta tell ya, he's a little crispy.
Ah, well.
Good work, Detective.
I think any loose ends can wait till tomorrow.
Uh, get some rest.
Eh, one last thing, what of the Vampirdzhiya?
They're still under my watch, just in case.
Okay.
I'm gonna take a shower.
- I'm taking a nap.
No, there's no time.
There's not long till sundown.
What are you talking about?
Johnny, no.
Wait, what are you talking about?
He wants to go back to Nikolai's nightclub.
What?
Why?
That crypt is one of the largest in Bucharest.
It could be connected to a dozen more, for all we know.
But we do know this much, where we can hit 'em where it's gonna hurt.
After everything we've been through?
Okay, Celeste.
Shoot.
What have we been through that's been so life-altering?
Two years in a cell, Johnny.
It gave me a long time to think.
Well, did you think about what Dad would say if he found out that you were falling for one of them?
Huh?
Do you think that'd give him some sort of comfort while he was visiting Mom's grave?
'N.
I'm with Celeste.
Nothing's clear anymore.
Have you looked around lately?
There's more of them every single day.
More and more humans will continue to go over to their side until one day there will be nobody left on ours.
Look, we've all had a long couple of days...
Don't.
Do I need to remind you, they know we know where they live.
We know where they live.
And now, they know where we live.
Hey, look at me.
Too scared to go home at night.
That's what you said.
Do you really wanna go on living like that?
No.
Do you ever sleep, Detective?
After today, I'm not so sure.
It's a dark one.
You shoulda seen him before he got the tan.
What can you tell us about it?
This thing represents a complete regression of the vampire genome.
The question is, what triggered it?
The infected blood sample?
If this were an isolated case, sure.
But for it to spread to so many, so quickly, this outbreak must have had more than one original carrier.
In fact, I'm even inclined to say that this is no accident at all.
It's more like a large scale demonstration of some kind...
Excuse me.
Derricks.
Derricks, Derricks, he's out of control.
You've got to stop him.
Whoa, Celeste, slow down.
Start over.
Johnny and Kat are on their way to Nikolai's.
What, Why?
Well, why do you think?
Well, why didn't you stop them?
They tied me to a chair for my own good.
All right, I'm on it.
- Derricks, there's more.
Well do I even wanna know?
I'm pretty sure half the city's about to come under siege.
What are you talking about?
There are more of them than we thought, Derricks.
A lot more.
Hang on.
You're gonna wanna hear this, Celeste Harker.
Celeste, you're on speakerphone.
As you were saying, there's a lot more of these?
A lot more.
At least half a dozen colonies across Sector Five, just like the one we saw today.
No, that's impossible.
I'm seeing massive movement beneath the city streets.
We've got hundreds of those things descending on Rahova.
Okay Celeste, thank you.
Hang tight.
Look.
Every advantage vampires have speed, strength, hearing, even the paralytic agent in their saliva this guy had in spades.
This guy had in spades.
So if there really are hundreds of these things out there.
We need to order an evacuation.
I think perhaps you are delirious from fatigue.
What did you not hear her?
I cannot order an evacuation of Bucharest and incite a panic...
Not the entire city.
Not the entire city, no, but Rahova, Ferentari.
There are ten thousand people at least still living there, and easily twice that many vampires.
You have a point.
Would you excuse us, please?
If what Miss Harker says is true,
I think this represents an opportunity for us to rid the city of these creatures before they spread to more densely populated areas.
Thirty thousand vampires and vagrants.
Small price to pay, don't you think?
Harker's still out there.
He's my responsibility.
Him and his sister.
I'm gonna bring him in.
If you feel you must.
Detective, just be careful.
We don't have to do this.
Then what are we doing?
Are we not still the Vampirdzhiya?
Have you forgotten why we do this?
We were scared back then.
We both lost people close to us.
Yeah.
What's changed?
I have to do this.
Even without you.
It was supposed to be a cure.
But it wasn't, was it?
It was a virus, and you went forward anyway.
Different means, same end.
To rid the world of vampires?
Do you know what I see when I look out that window, Detective?
Fear.
I see a city paralyzed by fear.
And now there are reports of vampires in London, Budapest, Prague, Barcelona.
Make no mistake, they are spreading.
They are the virus.
They represent the end of everything we have built.
Everything we know.
Surely you must see that.
We are going to take back our country.
But it never was your country, was it?
Vlad the Impaler was a damn vampire.
I knew it was a risk to put you on this case.
I need to know where you stand in regard to these monsters.
My wife is one of these monsters.
Yes, she is.
I am sorry for you.
Detective, please.
If it's any consolation, I will make sure you are here with your friends when it all goes down.
This isn't the Romanian Revolution, Kovaks.
Isn't it, though?
Take down Detective Derricks.
I repeat, take down Detective Derricks.
You?
Why are you helping me?
I saw you at the club last night.
You were with Nikolai and the others.
Open the door now.
If I don't make it out of here, you've got to give Anghel a message.
The synth blood is contaminated.
Kovaks and whoever he's working with are behind it.
They're the reason his son is dead.
Tell him yourself, just go through a window.
Go!
They won't show you any mercy.
And I won't show them any.
They gotta be down below, sleeping.
Really, Harker?
Too predictable.
Yeah, you might get us in a rush, but not before we take most of you with us, and your crypt.
Shame it has come to this.
It didn't have to, you know.
You would've done the same, eventually.
There's still a way out of this, for both of you.
You gotta be kidding me, right?
It's your choice, Harker.
Join us, or die.
But either way,
I'm gonna turn your sister, and she's gonna like it.
Try doing it from the next life.
Harker!
Been out of jail now for what, thirty-six hours?
Are you really in that much of a hurry to die?
What?
You forget what side you're on?
The only side you've been on Johnny is your own.
Human, vampire, you want it to be that simple, but it's not.
Now lower your weapons.
Lower your weapons.
Now shut your mouth for five damn minutes.
If you still want to die,
I'll shoot you myself.
No need to be so rude about it.
You too.
Give me five minutes before your Vanatorii Umane do anything drastic.
Why should I?
Because what I'm about to tell your father changes everything, and I don't want my team killing each other in the meantime.
You know the way, Detective.
It pleases me to see you alive.
Pleases me as well.
Anghel...
Nikolai told me you did everything you could.
Even so, I'm sorry.
Did you learn anything?
You could say that.
Tell me everything you know.
Peacekeepers in place.
The complex is locked down.
Derricks nearly ruined our plans, but in the end, he simply accelerated our time table.
Now, we wait.
These are disturbing developments, but not entirely surprising.
Kovaks is willing to sit back and sacrifice hundreds of humans just to turn public against you.
We have to expose the truth.
What we need to do is warn people.
Humans, and vampires alike.
Otherwise it won't even matter.
Once again, I am in your debt.
I'm just doin' my job.
Nevertheless, allow me to do something for you.
Cass, is that really you?
Hello, again.
You look...
The same?
Is this, um...
Do you live here?
It doesn't exactly work like that with us.
I drive through Ferentari every night, past the vampires, and the blood dealers, and the homeless.
I've seen your face a thousand times, but it was never you.
How can you be sure?
What I did to you, was unforgiveable.
But that doesn't mean I don't want you to forgive me.
I want to thank you.
No.
I was selfish.
I just didn't want to lose you, and I still lost you anyway.
You never lost me, Terry.
And you'll never have to.
I just don't know if that life's for me.
I know.
But, think about it.
You know where to find rne now.
What have we done?
We didn't do this, Kovaks did.
All units, all units, we have multiple disturbances in Rahova, Ferentari, Odai.
Please respond.
Half the city's under siege, where do we even start?
Celeste.
- Celeste.
We're quicker on foot from here.
HEY' 'bout time you have a real weapon.
Come on!
This is almost fun!
I'm starting to not hate you as much!
Just so you know, the feeling's not mutual.
Good.
Come on!
Come on you bastards.
Is that all you got?
Whoa, what about my hug?
Oh, I'm sorry Johnny, I almost forgot.
What are you, psychotic?
First of all, ow.
And secondly...
I could have been killed!
You're fine.
There's something you need to see.
Whoa, what is that?
Those are the blood transmitters we've injected into Aleksandr.
They've been passed on exponentially.
Wait, you're telling me that each one of these is a vampire bat?
They're being drawn into the heart of Ferentari.
Vamp central.
- Why?
Some kind of ultrasonic signal, but here's the interesting part.
The signal is only being relayed there.
It's actually originating here.
The Vampire Relations building?
- Someone's doing this on purpose.
That son of a bitch isn't just letting it happen, he's making it happen.
We have to stop that signal before this thing turns into a massacre.
We need to get in there tonight.
Well I can get us in there, but getting out, now that might be tricky.
By now, Kovaks will have the entire complex locked down tight.
He'll have snipers on the rooftops in case any vampire bats get too close.
Peacekeepers will be at the entrance.
The signal emitter should be on the rooftop along with more guards, but the moment we break in, they'll activate the UV lights.
That's going to be a problem.
That's why we're going to cut power to the entire city grid.
So no one can see?
They can.
Turn out the lights and we'll have the upper hand, but like everything else, the vampire bats will have the same advantage, only more so.
We're going to need backup on this one.
A lot of it.
You'll have it.
So, whaddya think?
Hell, I should be in prison right now anyway.
Why not?
I believe they're here.
Masks down!
Don't worry, they're just unconscious.
I can hear their heartbeats.
The control room should be right up ahead.
That's where we shut down the signal.
I think we've got a problem.
I'm seeing a lot of movement.
Tell me that's not what I think it is.
Transmitter must need full power to operate, and since we cut primary power to the building.
The vampire bats are all coming here now, and fast.
Then let's get that signal shut off, then, sooner rather than later.
Can you shut it down?
Got it.
Wait.
If I don't press this button right now, every two hundred pound vampire bat in Bucharest is gonna be here in the new few minutes.
Exactly.
Even for you, Harker, you're not making a lot of sense.
Let's say we shut off the signal.
What then?
The bats leave, we survive.
I got a better idea.
We blow the building.
That way they're all in the same place at the same time.
This is how we end it.
Tonight.
Are we really considering this?
Well, we wouldn't have to blow the entire building.
Just the transmitter on the roof.
That's actually not bad, Harker.
So... how do we do this, exactly?
With a little luck, and a lot of C-Four.
Kat!
I'm a little busy here, Johnny!
You appear to have brought some new friends with you this time.
You had to know the truth will come out.
Of course.
So genocide was something you wanted on your resume.
Is it really genocide when the survival of one's own species is at stake?
Or simply self-preservation?
Either way, that's not for you to decide.
Hey guys?
Go ahead, Celeste.
Uh, we got another problem.
This is bigger than you or me, Detective.
Much, much bigger.
Kat!
Katya!
John, we have to go.
Yeah.
When the main power came back on, so did the transmitter relay.
It's sending the bats back downtown.
You can't shut it off?
Not without the code.
You can't threaten me.
You know I would rather die than fail.
They're not mutually exclusive, by the way.
The code, Kovaks.
Now.
You know, sometimes we have to make decisions for others for their own good.
Don't you agree, Detective?
Oh, by the way, how is your wife?
I made a choice, and I've had to live with that, but that's got nothing to do with this.
Well, I think we should find out.
No!
I'm not going to shoot anyone else.
I have made my point.
What point?
She's dying.
No, there's gotta be something we can do.
There is.
No.
No, there's got to be something else.
A hospital or something we can help her!
Celeste, Celeste, talk to me!
Celeste!
Whoa, Harker, Harker.
Wait.
Think.
We need him.
We're losing her.
What do I do?
You can't make that decision for her.
Johnny...
Hey.
Celeste, tell me what I should do.
Celeste.
Save her.
Save her.
Please.
Your body's healing itself.
You're weak, but you'll be fine.
Johnny...
Sorry.
I couldn't stand to lose you.
You have nothing to be sorry for.
As I said, my point is made.
Is it so wrong to choose life?
No, and therein lies the dilemma.
If they survive, we do not.
If that's the way it's gonna go down, so be it.
Perhaps.
But I will let history be the judge of me, not you.
It's all right, I'm fine.
You may not be scared of dying, but you are scared of one thing becoming one of us.
You wouldn't.
The code, Kovaks, or become what you hate.
Okay.
Okay.
It's working.
The bats are doubling back again towards the roof.
What are you doing?
What is this?
A choice.
There's enough C-Four on the roof of this building to vaporize the top three floors.
Hey Harker, remind me, what floor are we on?
Top floor, boss.
So like I was saying, that there in your hand is a detonator, which you'll probably want to press once this place is crawling with those things you helped create, or if you really want to make a statement,
don't press it.
Just let the monsters eat you alive and you'll have high schools named after you and people will know you died for a cause you truly believe in.
And how do you know
I won't press it right now and blow us all to hell?
Because you still think you're making it out of this alive, and hope can be a real bitch like that.
So like I said, you got a choice.
You can't...
Shit.
Boss, what happened to you?
Shh!
Keep it down and come over here and get me out of this!
So how did you know?
How could you be sure Kovaks would blow the roof?
Kovaks was a coward.
I was pretty sure he'd take the easy way out.
And I had a second detonatorjust in case.
Well the next few days should be, urn... interesting.
It'll probably get worse before it gets better.
But vampires and humans will continue living side-by-side.
But will it last?
Does anything?
We had better go.
I've seen my last sunrise, haven't I?
I know Katya would have taken the same deal if she'd been given the chance.
You're still here and I'm grateful for that.
Bye Johnny.
Wait,
I'm coming with you.
'Bout time I said "hey" to my wife.
I'm here to see Grigore.
I'm expected.
Go on out the back.
Hell of a warm welcome, making me wait for you outside.
What do you want?
Well, you said if I ever had more.
AB negative.
Only one in a hundred.
Is that supposed to make it taste better?
Rare is always valuable.
Isn't that what the people say?
People say a lot of stupid things.
Thank you.
Don't snort it all at once.
You know, for such a rare blood type, you have little trouble obtaining it.
I guess.
That's what makes me your source.
My friends here believe you are the source.
They can taste that stuff in your blood.
If that's true, why buythe cowwhen you can drink the blood forfree, hm?
Today marks the end of the myth.
Our new reality is that vampires live amongst us.
And I, Constantin Kovaks, have been named head of the Department of Human Vampyre Relations in accordance with our government's wish to foster a genuine symbiotic situation.
When we reach this historic scientific conclusion, the synthetic blood will allowvampires and humans to finally live together in peace.
Afteryears of unsuccessful coexistence, the Romanian government has made the unilateral decision to cast all vampires to Sector Five.
I find it outrageous that this could happen in this day and age.
We are now not only subjugating these people, but quarantining them into what amounts to a modern day internment camp, only one with horrific living conditions.
So let me askyou, how long before Sector Five becomes an outright concentration camp?
Hey, the soonerthe better if you ask me.
The fact they even referto these things as people is frankly offensive.
They're an affront to God and everything we stand for.
I don't think for one minute theywouldn't do the same to us if they had halfa chance.
As long as people continue to think like you do, there will never be a lasting peace.
Now, I want you to listen to me, and listen good.
Humans and vampires will never live in peace.
It goes against the natural order of things.
Make no mistake, it's us orthem.
So what you have to ask your self is, whose side are you on?
Keep your ID's out.
To the left.
ID's out.
Right.
I had it.
I just had it.
- There a problem?
- Yeah, my ID.
I just...
- Well. no one gets in without ID.
- I know, I know.
I just...
Step out of line, please.
I've got it.
I take yourtrash twice a day.
- I deserve your respect.
- No one gets in without ID, so move along.
I said move along.
Ah, Lieutenant Derricks.
You look like you just spent an hourwith mywife.
We've got a situation developing in Sector 5.
CIearlyyou do not know mywife.
I meant to sayyou Iookterrible.
- Yeah, I got that.
- Palinka?
It's not even nine-thirty.
- It's synthetic.
- Then what's the point?
Three vampires and one blood dealer wound up dead last night in Ferentari.
- Anyone I know?
- No.
Well, then it would seem the situation has resolved itself.
It looks like they were ripped to pieces.
This is making me reconsider my breakfast.
You know, whatever did this couldn't have been a normal vamp.
It sure as hell wasn't human.
Last Monday.
Last Thursday.
Same M.O., same district.
You're saying there's things out there worse than vampires?
We only have learned that vampires exist in the last ten years.
Who knows what else might be out there.
- I'll wait.
- No, no, come.
Detective Derricks,
Lieutenant Innes-Bunchley.
First from Scotland Yard.
I want him to ride along with you on this one.
- Yeah, no.
- What, he's perfectly qualified.
- I'm perfectly qualified.
- No offense Bumcheese, but I need someone a little crazier.
Someone who won't flinch at this.
Harker.
Give me Harker and his team.
- Oh, yes.
- Harker?
Yeah, the Vampirdzhiya.
Vampire hunters.
You know, the next attacks could be on someone you actually give a damn about.
Okay.
Okay, take the savage.
But you're taking him as well.
Fine.
Hey, freaky giant guy.
You're not even that big.
What are you, like... two-eighty?
Two-ninety?
Fine.
You're probably more like three-ten.
Anyone evertell you you talktoo much?
Yeah, but I probablywasn't listening.
What was it you were saying about...
Hey.
Well, I'm glad you could join us, John.
Harker.
John's mytoilet's name.
So what'd you do to piss off the big guy?
Would you believe it was over a sandwich?
Vampirdzhiya, right?
Am I am I pronouncing that right?
Well, I'm Lieutenant Derricks, and this is Lieutenant Innes-Bumstead,
- and we're here...
- Whoa...
What?
Sorry,
- in his- in his what?
- It's Bunchley.
Innes-Bunchley.
Anyway, we're here to offeryou a way out of this hell hole.
Call it work release.
We know the Vampirdzhiya have certain skills.
You want us to hunt vampires.
Not exactly.
Something out there is already doing that.
So what do you want from us, then?
Well, I would like you to help me stop it.
Why would we want to do that?
Because it's not just blood suckers that are being killed.
It's because I can get you transferred backto America.
But mainly, because you're good at killing things.
It's what you do.
My sister, too.
Or no deal.
All right?
Told you.
Matter of time.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.
We done?
Couple of stops we need to make first.
We don't have time forthis.
Actually, we do.
It won't be darkfor another houryet.
Which means it's still happy hour.
They got a point, bumbly.
You boys got this, right?
We cannot turn in an expense report for the nightclub Kama Sutra.
Reckon you owe me that for the past two years.
What can I get for you guys?
What ever they want.
Uh, beer.
Round.
And, um...
So what are we doing here, Harker?
Please tell me the last member ofyourfabled bunch isn't a prostitute.
She's not a prostitute.
She's a dancer.
The hours are better.
So, tell me.
How's a cop from the East Coast end up in Eastern Europe?
Same way most Americans do.
Married a local.
How'd that work out?
Still here.
We definitely can't drink on duty, guys.
You got a lot to learn about being in Eastern Europe, Bumlick.
Bunchley.
Innes-Bunchley.
What?
To still being here.
Katya.
You went out for ice cream and it tookyou two years to come back?
What can I say?
I eat slow.
Champagne Room.
Save my seat.
The Champagne Room?
We can't expense that.
Wha
- Foreplay.
Nice.
I like it.
Two years, Johnny.
You couldn't find a way of letting me knowyou were all right?
Or even alive?
A vamp could have killed you in there for all I know.
You keep the vamps separate, Kat.
You know that.
Listen to me.
I thought about you.
Not enough to write.
I couldn't write.
It might have lead 'em straight to you.
You had a phone call, Johnny.
Everyone gets a phone call.
Yeah, but how would I know you were safe after?
So what are you doing here now?
Making sure you are... safe.
Look, I knowthings have been bad.
Bad is what things were like when you went in.
Things now, they're worse than ever.
I'm stuck here night after night, too scared to even go home at night...
Why didn't you just leave?
Get the hell out of Bucharest?
I knew I'd never see you again.
And you neverwoulda had a chance to slap me, right?
Not in the mood for a lap dance?
Bumbledor gave me one in the car.
He's more the kinda guy that would stay home with the wife.
- Feel better?
- Like new.
Kat's up to speed, so we're readywhen you are.
What?
She's part of the crew?
Why else do you thinkwe're here?
You know it's work.
You can expense that.
Let me guess, Harkerfamily reunion.
When I heard you were out, I had a sudden craving to see you.
Is that supposed to scare me?
It's okay.
Marius here, he's all talk.
Hardly put up a fight the last time we met.
Do you thinkwe'II let you walk freely afterwhat you did?
He served his time.
- Nowtake a step back.
- Killed myfather.
You mean the sick bastard that turned you...
Show your self in our district and we'll bleed you dry.
- Yeah?
You come near me again.
- And you'll what?
Sick your slut on me?
I'm sorry, what?
She didn't tell you.
Your girl has been making enemies since you left.
Keep talking, Marius.
I swear to God I will rip your head off and stick it right up your...
Okay, I'm a cop, so try to cool it on the death threats.
Keep working with him, and my kind will turn on you.
Derricks!
Derricks!
Bouncers are missing.
There's blood.
And I don't suppose you know anything about that?
You're ours, Harker.
You and your merry band.
Go.
You know I released you on one condition.
- That leech just killed two people
- We don't know that.
Hey, low-profile.
How's this for low-profile?
Semi-automatic, nine millimeter, hollow points.
Not bad.
Haven't told you the best part,
- mercury tips.
- Mercury?
- The vapor in the bulb.
- Yeah.
To them it's poison.
To us it's poison.
I thought it's always silver, vampires' weakness?
What do you thinkthey called mercury back in the day?
Quicksilver.
Shoot 'em with enough of these, they'll boil out from the inside.
- So what else you have in there?
- We should go.
- Yeah, I'm driving.
Keys.
- What?
Great.
It seems Harker and his friends are backto their old tricks.
We should tell Nikolai.
Listen.
AIeksandr.
Hey, we'rejust here for information, not to get vampire blood on the hands.
Yeah, yeah, I
- I get it.
You should know that those things in there, they don't care you're a cop.
To them, blood is blood.
Okay?
We need to speak to whoever's in charge.
Back of the line, bleeders.
This is official police business.
I know your people can't hearfor crap, so let me try again.
You're not on the list.
I'd check again.
Didn't you read the sign outside?
No soliciting.
We're not selling Girl Scout cookies.
We just want to talk.
Surrender you rweapons.
You won't be harmed, you have myword.
Don't trust him.
You force yourway into our house at gunpoint with the Vampirdzhiya.
Give me a reason to trust you.
We're not giving up our guns.
Yeah we are.
Rememberwhywe're here.
All of you.
Do it.
I think I prefer being in prison.
Just you.
Harker, too.
Trust me, he's better where I can keep an eye on him.
How old is this place?
older than Bucuresti itself.
older than the Kazikle Voyvoda.
The "Impaler Prince".
VIad the Impaler.
And his Ordinul Draculya.
"Order of the Dragon".
Dracula?
So who does that make you, then?
I am Anghel.
I had the honor to serve during the Carpathian Campaign.
My father is six hundred years old.
Dude, you don't look a day overtwo-fifty.
You better have good reason for bringing humans here.
For bringing him here.
Three vampires were killed last night, torn limb from limb.
Theywere buying human blood on the black market.
The past week, there's been easily a dozen murders, both human and vampire.
Though, from the look on both yourfaces, this isn't news.
What isn't news to us, Detective, is that human police don't care about crimes against vampires,
but now that humans are also being targeted, here you are.
I believe the distribution of this black market blood has led to certain
- impurities.
- I don't follow.
A contaminated blood sample has spread through our people not unlike one of your sexually transmitted diseases.
The infected appear to be turning into a primitive subspecies, acting only on their most primal urges, turning our genes against us.
Like some kind of retrovirus.
So, what are you saying exactly?
I think they're saying there's life-size vampire bats flying around Bucharest, sucking it dry.
I guess that's where I come in.
Vampire metabolism is already must fasterthan a human's, but these vampire bats, as you call them, their needs are much higher.
Their blood thirst, insatiable.
One of my own sons has gone missing.
I fear he has fallen into their ranks.
So how do we stop 'em?
- You can't, human.
- Oh, and you can?
We are some what limited by our nocturnal tendencies, but you can track these creatures during the daywhile they slumber.
Of course, they'll tearyou apart if you do.
Yeah.
We'll take our chances.
We should work together.
What?
That is not what I signed up for.
You signed up to kill vampires, and as far as I can tell, these are about as pure vampire as they get.
I do not wish them killed.
You must understand we don't have any choice.
Nikolai will help you find them if you will help us tryto save them.
Good luck, Detective Derricks.
It's not part of the deal.
We work alone.
Actually, you workfor me now.
We don't need them.
Wait, is that you?
Fire of eighteen forty-seven.
Humans burnt down half the city.
That was the last time we revealed ourselves.
Jury's still out if things will be any different this time around.
Vanatorii Umane.
It's time.
Vanatorii Umane?
Human hunters.
Not all humans, just the ones you brought with you.
Don't worry, Detective.
They're off the clock.
Where's Marius?
- Find him.
- Uh...
Found him.
I'm sorry.
I brought them here.
Get out!
Harker!
Hey!
Hey!
Faster metabolism apparently means they die faster.
Nice.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
- What are you doing?
!
- He could lead us to the others.
AIeksandr?
That's not AIeksandr anymore.
Brother, we onlywant to help you.
No!
I told you we wanted him alive.
Tracking bullet.
You should have said so.
How do we track him?
Equipment's back at the...
Where?
Your hide out?
No.
No.
We are not taking them backthere.
Why not?
You already knowwhere we live.
- That's not the same and you know it.
- The hell it's not.
If we're working together, we're working together.
Good thinking using that tracking bullet.
I expected a bit more.
It's no six hundred-year old disco.
Looks like he's moving along Rahovei through Ferentari.
If he removes the tracking dart?
No, transmitters are already his blood stream.
Not bad.
At least you're bringing something to the table.
So, uh, who pays for all this?
We bought stock in SanguiTech.
Pharmaceutical company behind the synth blood?
We got in early.
And no, the irony's not lost on me.
So where are we with our guy?
He stopped moving somewhere here, in the sewers below the processing plant in Rahova.
That's where their colony must be.
When you say "colony," how many do you thinkthere are?
Hard to say.
Well how many of you are missing?
Right, hard to say.
You still don't want us knowing how many of you there actually are.
You're still getting used to the idea that you know about us at all.
Let'sjust saythere may be more of them out there.
A lot more.
Okay.
We should gear up, get back out.
Not until sunrise.
Not if you want to survive.
I guess patience isn't one ofyourvirtues, Harker.
Well, it's definitely one of yours.
I mean, without us you'd be still sipping on cocktails waiting for someone else to find your brotherforyou.
Don't worry about it, leech.
Theywon't be the first vampires I've enjoyed killing, Just... just the ugliest.
Don't think I didn't see what happened back at the club.
You might not have killed Marius, but you may as well have.
Once this so-called alliance is over, you and I are going to discuss it.
Really?
Whywait?
Okay, okay, okay.
We may have some time to kill, but let's not kill each other, yeah?
What?
He started it.
Some slumber party.
Did you thinkwe slept upside-down, hanging from the rafters?
Those things'II kill you.
You really need to worry?
What happened to getting some rest?
I guess I'm just restless.
I can see that.
So your ex, what's the storythere?
What makes you thinkthere's a story?
She got sick a fewyears ago.
Doctors didn't give her long.
I was desperate.
I knew she'd say no, so I didn't give her a choice.
You had herturned?
I knew she'd object, so I did it while she slept.
She woke up a vampire.
She's out there somewhere.
You'll find her.
You know, the thing is, I wouldn't even know what to sayto her if I did.
I'm sure you will.
That's real, isn't it?
Can I ask you something?
Why do you hate the vampires so much?
Is that a real question?
You could have left town, like so many others.
People shouldn't have to leave their own cities.
They shouldn't have to live in fear.
Are you frightened of me?
Yes.
Good.
Is this okay, us talking like this?
Like what?
You know, like a couple of people.
We are a couple of people.
No, I know.
That's not what I meant.
It's just...
I know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's it like out there?
If I didn't know better, I'd say your sister's flirting with Nikolai.
- What?
- I'm sure they'rejust passing time.
Perfect.
I don't know about you, but I could use a shower.
You coming?
Derricks has involved the vampires.
They're moving on the sewers at sunrise.
Understood.
I'll make sure.
The signal stopped moving four hundred meters south by southwest.
Well, this is nice.
We got enough C-Four to take out halfofSector Five.
But, I'm sure it won't come to that.
Remember, we want AIeksandr alive.
- I'll take the lead.
- Nikolai...
You can't see in the dark.
That's whywe have flashlights.
What am I here for, then?
Bitching, apparently.
Fine.
By all means.
A hundred meters this way.
I'm sorry.
I can smell them.
Means they can smell us, too.
From here on out, silence.
Flash lights off.
Harker...
Wait.
My brother is in here.
Let me find him first.
What about the rest of them?
plant your charges, but give me the detonator.
Come on.
Come on!
Okay, come on.
Okay, okay.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Go.
- Come on!
- Go!
Go, go, go, go!
They're getting through!
Fire in the hole!
They're giving up.
They'll be back, once theyfind anotherway around.
Okay, we get outta here while we still can.
- No.
- No?
You sawthe size of that colony.
There were hundreds of them.
This is our chance to wipe 'em all out at once.
He's right, Harker.
If we leave now, they'll move the colony before we get back.
We must detonate the explosives.
You're the one that dropped the damn thing.
You go get it.
Unless it wasn't an accident.
We don't need the detonator.
Wejust need someone to get close enough to blow one of the C-Four bricks.
Blowing one of the bricks will set offa chain reaction to take out the rest of them, too.
This has the biggest range.
Who's our best shot?
My eyesight is twice as sensitive as yours.
How do we even know you're gonna take the shot?
- Harker...
- Just cover me.
- How close you need to get?
- The door.
At that distance you're going to blowyourself up.
Let'sjust get him to the door.
I can't get a clean shot.
We need that detonator.
Let's clear a path.
Follow up on me.
Go.
Brother.
No.
Everyone out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Harker, just go!
Something's blocking the door!
Anytime, Harker!
It's stuck!
Here!
Go!
She's gone.
They're all gone.
I couldn't save any of them.
AIeksandr is gone.
He gave his life for us.
That proves he died your brother and not one of those things.
You need to stop hurting yourself and cover up.
Harker...
He's a dead man.
He will payforwhat he did to Andrei, I promise.
But right nowwe need him alive.
Harker!
You better lock him up somewhere I can't find him.
- What is the meaning of this?
- You tell me.
- Lieutenant?
- He was waiting for us.
As we took out the colony, he was waiting to trap us in there with those creatures.
Vampires are a disease!
They have no business living amongst us.
It wasn'tjust the vampires, was it?
I was in there.
Get him out of here.
Well, this will be an embarrassment to the department.
People are dead because of him!
I thinkwe can both use one of these?
Someone must be responsible for the tainted blood.
Tainted blood?
The black market blood.
Some of it's tainted and infected with something that alters the vampires' DNA, turns them into these full-on monsters.
Now killing the infected won't stop others from getting sick or changing.
We need to find the source.
And who knows if that was even the only colony.
Colony?
There are colonies?
Unless the poor bastard downstairs is the last.
You brought one here?
The examination room, yeah.
I gotta tell you, he's a little crispy.
Ah, well.
Good work, Detective.
I think any loose ends can wait till tomorrow.
Get some rest.
Eh, one last thing, what of the Vampirdzhiya?
They're still under mywatch, just in case.
Okay.
I'm gonna take a shower.
- I'm taking a nap.
- No, there's no time.
There's not long till sundown.
What are you talking about?
Johnny, no.
Wait, what are you talking about?
He wants to go back to Nikolai's nightclub.
What?
Why?
That crypt is one of the largest in Bucharest.
It could be connected to a dozen more, for all we know.
But we do know this much, where we can hit 'em where it's gonna hurt.
After everything we've been through?
Okay, Celeste.
Shoot.
What have we been through that's been so life-altering?
Two years in a cell, Johnny.
It gave me a long time to think.
Well, did you think about what Dad would say if he found out that you were falling for one of them?
Huh?
Do you thinkthat'd give him some sort of comfort
- while he was visiting Mom's grave?
- I...
I'm with Celeste.
Nothing's clear anymore.
Have you looked around lately?
There's more of them every single day.
More and more humans will continue to go overto their side until one day there will be nobody left on ours.
Look, we've all had a long couple of days...
Don't.
Do I need to remind you, they knowwe knowwhere they live.
And now, they knowwhere we live.
Hey, look at me.
Too scared to go home at night.
That's what you said.
Do you reallywanna go on living like that?
No.
Do you ever sleep, Detective?
Aftertoday, I'm not so sure.
It's a dark one.
You shoulda seen him before he got the tan.
What can you tell us about it?
This thing represents a complete regression of the vampire genome.
The question is, what triggered it?
The infected blood sample?
If this were an isolated case, sure.
But for it to spread to so many, so quickly, this outbreak must have had more than one original carrier.
In fact, I'm even inclined to say that this is no accident at all.
It's more like a large scale demonstration of some kind...
Derricks.
Derricks, Derricks, he's out of control.
You've got to stop him.
Whoa, Celeste, slow down.
Start over.
Johnny and Kat are on theirway to Nikolai's.
- What, why?
- Well, why do you think?
- Well, why didn't you stop them?
- Theytied me to a chairfor my own good.
- All right, I'm on it.
- Derricks, there's more.
Well do I even wanna know?
I'm pretty sure half the city's about to come under siege.
What are you talking about?
There are more of them than we thought, Derricks.
A lot more.
Hang on.
You're gonna wanna hearthis, Celeste Harker.
Celeste, you're on speakerphone.
As you were saying, there's a lot more of these?
A lot more.
At least halfa dozen colonies across Sector Five,
-just like the one we sawtoday.
- No, that's impossible.
I'm seeing massive movement beneath the city streets.
We've got hundreds of those things descending on Rahova.
Okay Celeste, thank you.
Hang tight.
Look.
Every advantage vampires have speed, strength, hearing, even the paralytic agent in their saliva... this guy had in spades.
So if there really are hundreds of these things out there...
We need to order an evacuation.
I think perhaps you are delirious from fatigue.
What did you not hear her?
I cannot order an evacuation of Bucharest and incite a panic
No, but Rahova, Ferentari.
There are ten thousand people at least... still living there, and easilytwice that manyvampires.
You have a point.
Would you excuse us, please?
If what Miss Harker says is true, I think this represents an opportunityfor us to rid the city of these creatures before they spread to more densely populated areas.
Thirtythousand vampires and vagrants.
Small price to pay, don't you think?
Harker's still out there.
He's my responsibility.
Him and his sister.
I'm gonna bring him in.
If you feel you must.
Detective, just be careful.
We don't have to do this.
Then what are we doing?
Are we not still the Vampirdzhiya?
Have you forgotten whywe do this?
We were scared backthen.
We both lost people close to us.
Yeah.
What's changed?
I have to do this.
Even without you.
It was supposed to be a cure.
But it wasn't, was it?
It was a virus, and you went forward anyway.
Different means, same end.
To rid the world of vampires?
Do you know what I see when I look out that window, Detective?
Fear.
I see a city paralyzed byfear.
And nowthere are reports of vampires in London, Budapest, Prague, Barcelona.
Make no mistake, they are spreading.
They are the virus.
They represent the end of everything we have built.
Everything we know.
Surelyyou must see that.
We are going to take back our country.
But it neverwas your country, was it?
VIad the Impalerwas a damn vampire.
I knew it was a risk to put you on this case.
I need to knowwhere you stand in regard to these monsters.
My wife is one of these monsters.
Yes, she is.
I am sorryforyou.
Detective, please.
If it's any consolation,
I will make sure you are here with yourfriends when it all goes down.
This isn't the Romanian Revolution, Kovaks.
Isn't it, though?
Take down Detective Derricks.
I repeat,
- take down Detective Derricks.
- This way.
You?
Why are you helping me?
I saw you at the club last night.
You were with Nikolai and the others.
Open the door now.
If I don't make it out of here, you've got to give Anghel a message.
The synth blood is contaminated.
Kovaks and whoever he's working with are behind it.
They're the reason his son is dead.
Tell him yourself, just go through a window.
Go!
Theywon't showyou any mercy.
And I won't showthem any.
They gotta be down below, sleeping.
Really, Harker?
Too predictable.
Yeah, you might get us in a rush, but not before we take most of you with us,
and your crypt.
Shame it has come to this.
It didn't have to, you know.
You would've done the same, eventually.
There's still a way out of this, for both of you.
You gotta be kidding me, right?
It's your choice, Harker.
Join us, or die.
But eitherway,
I'm gonna turn your sister, and she's gonna like it.
Try doing it from the next life.
Harker!
Been out of jail now for what, thirty-six hours?
Are you really in that much of a hurryto die?
What?
You forget what side you're on?
The only side you've been on Johnny is your own.
Human, vampire, you want it to be that simple, but it's not.
Now lower your weapons.
Lower your weapons.
Now shut your mouth for five damn minutes.
If you still want to die, I'll shoot you myself.
No need to be so rude about it.
You too.
Give me five minutes before yourVanatorii Umane do anything drastic.
Why should I?
Because what I'm about to tell your father changes everything, and I don't want my team killing each other in the meantime.
You know the way, Detective.
It pleases me to see you alive.
Pleases me as well.
- Anghel...
- Nikolai told me you did everything you could.
Even so, I'm sorry.
Did you learn anything?
You could saythat.
Tell me everything you know.
UN Peacekeepers in place.
The complex is locked down.
Derricks nearly ruined our plans, but in the end, he simply accelerated ourtime table.
Now, we wait.
These are disturbing developments,
- but not entirely surprising.
- Kovaks is willing to sit back and sacrifice hundreds of humansjust to turn public against you.
We have to expose the truth.
What we need to do is warn people.
Humans, and vampires alike.
Otherwise it won't even matter.
Once again, I am in your debt.
I'm just doin' my job.
Nevertheless, allow me to do something for you.
Cass, is that reallyyou?
Hello, again.
You look...
The same?
It
- Is this, um... do you live here?
It doesn't exactlywork like that with us.
I drive through Ferentari every night, past the vampires, and the blood dealers, and the homeless.
I've seen yourface a thousand times, but it was neveryou.
How can you be sure?
What I did to you, was unforgiveable.
But that doesn't mean I don't want you to forgive me.
I want to thank you.
No.
I was selfish.
I just didn't want to lose you, and I still lost you anyway.
You never lost me, Terry.
And you'll never have to.
I just don't know if that life's for me.
I know.
But, think about it.
You knowwhere to find me now.
What have we done?
We didn't do this, Kovaks did.
All units, all units, we have multiple disturbances in Rahova, Ferentari, Odai.
- Please respond.
- Half the city's under siege, where do we even start?
- Celeste.
- Celeste.
We're quicker on foot from here.
Hey, 'bout time you have a real weapon.
Come on!
This is almost fun!
I'm starting to not hate you as much!
Just so you know, the feeling's not mutual.
Good.
Come on!
Come on you bastards.
Is that all you got?
Whoa, what about my hug?
Oh, I'm sorry Johnny, I almost forgot.
What are you, psychotic?
- First of all, ow.
And secondly...
- I could have been killed!
You're fine.
There's something you need to see.
Whoa, what is that?
Those are the blood transmitters we've injected into AIeksandr.
They've been passed on exponentially.
Wait, you're telling me that each one of these is a vampire bat?
They're being drawn into the heart of Ferentari.
- Vamp central.
- Why?
Some kind of ultrasonic signal, but here's the interesting part.
The signal is only being relayed there.
It's actually originating here.
- The Vampire Relations building?
- Someone's doing this on purpose.
That son of a bitch isn'tjust letting it happen, he's making it happen.
We have to stop that signal before this thing turns into a massacre.
We need to get in there tonight.
Well I can get us in there, but getting out, nowthat might be tricky.
By now, Kovaks will have the entire complex locked down tight.
He'll have snipers on the rooftops in case anyvampire bats get too close.
Peacekeepers will be at the entrance.
The signal emitter should be on the rooftop along with more guards, but the moment we break in, they'll activate the UV lights.
That's going to be a problem.
That's whywe're going to cut power to the entire city grid.
So no one can see?
They can.
Turn out the lights and we'll have the upper hand, but like everything else, the vampire bats will have the same advantage, only more so.
We're going to need backup on this one.
A lot of it.
You'll have it.
So, whaddya think?
Hell, I should be in prison right now anyway.
Why not?
I believe they're here.
Masks down!
Don't worry, they'rejust unconscious.
I can heartheir heartbeats.
The control room should be right up ahead.
That's where we shut down the signal.
I thinkwe've got a problem.
I'm seeing a lot of movement.
Tell me that's not what I think it is.
Transmitter must need full power to operate, and since we cut primary power to the building...
The vampire bats are all coming here now, and fast.
Then let's get that signal shut off, then, sooner ratherthan later.
Can you shut it down?
Got it.
Wait...
If I don't press this button right now, every two hundred pound vampire bat in Bucharest is gonna be here in the newfew minutes.
Exactly.
Even for you, Harker, you're not making a lot of sense.
Let's saywe shut off the signal.
What then?
The bats leave, we survive.
I got a better idea.
We blowthe building.
That way they're all in the same place at the same time.
This is how we end it.
Tonight.
Are we really considering this?
Well, we wouldn't have to blow the entire building.
Just the transmitter on the roof.
- That's actually not bad, Harker.
- So... how do we do this, exactly?
With a little luck, and a lot ofC-Four.
Kat!
I'm a little busy here, Johnny!
You appearto have brought some newfriends with you this time.
You had to knowthe truth will come out.
Of course.
So genocide was something you wanted on your resume.
Is it really genocide when the survival of one's own species is at stake?
Or simply self-preservation?
Eitherway, that's not for you to decide.
Hey guys?
Go ahead, Celeste.
Uh, we got another problem.
This is biggerthan you or me, Detective.
Much, much bigger.
Kat!
Katya!
John, we have to go.
Yeah.
When the main power came back on, so did the transmitter relay.
It's sending the bats back downtown.
- You can't shut it off?
- Not without the code.
You can't threaten me.
You know I would rather die than fail.
They're not mutually exclusive, by the way.
The code, Kovaks.
Now.
You know, sometimes we have to make decisions for others fortheir own good.
Don't you agree, Detective?
Oh, by the way, how is yourwife?
I made a choice, and I've had to live with that, but that's got nothing to do with this.
Well, I thinkwe should find out.
No!
I'm not going to shoot anyone else.
I have made my point.
What point?
!
She's dying.
No, there's- there's gotta be something we can do.
There is.
No.
No, there's got to be something else.
A... a hospital or something we can... we can help her!
Celeste, Celeste, talk- talk to me!
Celeste!
Whoa, Harker, Harker.
Wait.
Think.
We need him.
We're losing her.
I don't...
What do I do?
You can't make that decision for her.
Johnny...
Hey.
Celeste, tell me what I should do.
Celeste...
Save her.
Save her.
Please.
Your body's healing itself.
You're weak, but you'll be fine.
Johnny...
Sorry...
I couldn't stand to lose you.
You have nothing to be sorryfor.
As I said, my point is made.
Is it so wrong to choose life?
No, and therein lies the dilemma.
If they survive, we do not.
If that's the way it's gonna go down, so be it.
Perhaps.
But I will let history be the judge of me, not you.
It's all right, I'm fine.
You may not be scared of dying, but you are scared ofone thing... becoming one of us.
You wouldn't.
The code, Kovaks, or become what you hate.
Okay.
Okay.
It's working.
The bats are doubling back again towards the roof.
What are you doing?
- What is this?
- A choice.
There's enough C-Four on the roof of this building to vaporize the top three floors.
Harker, remind me, what floor are we on?
Top floor, boss.
So like I was saying, that there in your hand is a detonator, which you'll probablywant to press once this place is crawling with those things you helped create, or... if you reallywant to make a statement, don't press it.
Just let the monsters eat you alive and you'll have high schools named afteryou and people will knowyou died for a cause you truly believe in.
And how do you know I won't press it right now and blow us all to hell?
Because you still think you're making it out of this alive, and hope can be a real bitch like that.
So like I said, you got a choice.
You can't...
Boss, what happened to you?
Keep it down and come over here and get me out of this!
So how did you know?
How could you be sure Kovaks would blowthe roof?
Kovaks was a coward.
I was pretty sure he'd take the easyway out.
And I had a second detonator just in case.
Well the next few days should be, um... interesting.
It'll probably get worse before it gets better.
But vampires and humans will continue living side-by-side.
But will it last?
Does anything?
We had better go.
I've seen my last sunrise, haven't I?
I know Katya would have taken the same deal... if she'd been given the chance.
You're still here and...
I'm grateful forthat.
Bye Johnny.
Wait,
I'm coming with you.
'Bout time I said "hey" to mywife.
I'm here to see Grigore.
I'm expected.
Go on out the back.
Whoa.
Hell of a warm welcome, making me wait for you outside.
What do you want?
Well, you said if I ever had more.
AB negative.
Only one in a hundred.
Is that supposed to make it taste better?
Rare is always valuable.
Isn't that what the people say?
People say a lot of stupid things.
Thank you.
Don't snort it all at once.
You know, for such a rare blood type, you have little trouble obtaining it.
I guess.
That's what makes me your source.
My friends here believe you are the source.
They can taste that stuff in your blood.
If that's true, why buy the cow when you can drink the blood for free, hm?
"NIGHTBREAKERS
- VAMPIRE NATION"
Today marks the end of the myth.
Our new reality is that vampires live amongst us.
And I, Constantin Kovaks, have been named head of the
Department of Human Vampyre Relations in accordance with our government's wish to foster a genuine symbiotic situation.
When we reach this historic scientific conclusion, the synthetic blood will allow vampires and humans to finally live together in peace.
After years of unsuccessful coexistence, the Romanian government has made the unilateral decision to cast all vampires to Sector Five.
I find it outrageous that this could happen in this day and age.
We are now not only subjugating these people, but quarantining them into what amounts to a modern day internment camp, only one with horrific living conditions.
So let me ask you, how long before Sector Five becomes an outright concentration camp?
Hey, the sooner the better if you ask me.
The fact they even refer to these things as people is frankly offensive.
They're an affront to God and everything we stand for.
I don't think for one minute they wouldn't do the same to us if they had half a chance.
As long as people continue to think like you do, there will never be a lasting peace.
Now, I want you to listen to me, and listen good.
Humans and vampires will never live in peace.
It goes against the natural order of things.
Make no mistake, it's us or them.
Which side are you on?
Keep your id's out.
To the left. lD's out.
Right.
I had it.
I just had it.
- There a problem?
- Yeah, my ID.
I just...
Well, no one gets in without ID.
- I know, I know.
I just...
Step out of line, please.
I've got it.
I take your trash twice a day.
I deserve your respect.
No one gets in without ID, so move along.
I said move along.
Ah, Lieutenant Derricks.
You look like you just spent an hour with my wife.
We've got a situation developing in Sector 5.
Clearly you do not know my wife.
I meant to say you look terrible.
- Yeah, I got that.
- Palinka?
It's not even nine-thirty.
- It's synthetic.
- Then what's the point?
Three vampires and one blood dealer wound up dead last night in Ferentari.
Anyone I know?
No.
Well, then it would seem the situation has resolved itself.
It looks like they were ripped to pieces.
This is making me reconsider my breakfast.
You know, whatever did this couldn't have been a normal vamp.
It sure as hell wasn't human.
Last Monday.
Last Thursday.
Same M.O., same district.
You're saying there's things out there worse than vampires?
We only have learned that vampires exist in the last ten years.
Who knows what else might be out there.
I'll wait.
No, no, come.
Detective Derricks, Lieutenant lnnes-Bunchley.
First from Scotland Yard.
I want him to ride along with you on this one.
- Yeah, no.
- What, he's perfectly qualified.
I'm perfectly qualified.
No offense Bumcheese, but I need someone a little crazier.
Someone who won't flinch at this.
Harker.
Give me Harker and his team.
That's...
Oh, yes.
Harke r?
Yeah, the Vampirdzhiya.
Vampire hunters.
You know, the next attacks could be on someone you actually give a damn about.
Shit.
Okay.
Okay, take the savage.
But you're taking him as well.
Fine.
Alright.
Hey, freaky giant guy.
You're not even that big.
What are you, like two-eighty?
Two-ninety?
Fine.
You're probably more like three-ten.
Anyone ever tell you you talk too much?
Yeah, but I probably wasn't listening.
What was it you were saying about...
Hey.
Well, I'm glad you could join us, John.
Harker.
John's my toilet's name.
So what'd you do to piss off the big guy?
Would you believe it was over a sandwich?
Vampirdzhiya, right?
Am I pronouncing that right?
Well, I'm Lieutenant Derricks, and this is Lieutenant lnnes-Bumstead, and we're here...
What?
Sorry, in his what?
It's Bunchley. lnnes-Bunchley.
Anyway, we're here to offer you a way out of this hell hole.
Call it work release.
We know the Vampirdzhiya have certain skills.
You want us to hunt vampires.
Not exactly.
Something out there is already doing that.
So what do you want from us, then?
Well, I would like you to help me stop it.
Why would we want to do that?
Because it's not just blood suckers that are being killed.
It's because I can get you transferred back to America.
But mainly, because you're good at killing things.
It's what you do.
My sister, too.
Or no deal.
All right?
Told you.
Matter of time.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.
We done?
Couple of stops we need to make first.
We don't have time for this.
Actually, we do.
It won't be dark for another hour yet.
Which means it's still happy hour.
They got a point, bumbly.
You boys got this, right?
We cannot turn in an expense report for the nightclub Kama Sutra.
Reckon you owe me that for the past two years.
What can I get for you guys?
Whatever they want.
Uh, beer.
Round.
And, um...
So what are we doing here, Harker?
Please tell me the last member of your fabled bunch isn't a prostitute.
She's not a prostitute.
She's a dancer.
The hours are better.
So, tell me.
How's a cop from the East Coast end up in Eastern Europe?
Same way most Americans do.
Married a local.
How'd that work out?
Still here.
We definitely can't drink on duty, guys.
You got a lot to learn about being in Eastern Europe, Bumlick.
Bunchley. lnnes-Bunchley.
- What?
To still being here.
Katya.
You went out for ice cream and it took you two years to come back?
What can I say?
I eat slow.
Champagne Room.
Save my seat.
The Champagne Room?
We can't expense that.
Foreplay.
Nice.
I like it.
Two years, Johnny.
You couldn't find a way of letting me know you were all right?
Or even alive?
A vamp could have killed you in there for all I know.
You keep the vamps separate, Kat.
You know that.
Listen to me.
I thought about you.
Not enough to write.
I couldn't write.
It might have lead 'em straight to you.
You had a phone call, Johnny.
Everyone gets a phone call.
Yeah, but how would I know you were safe after?
So what are you doing here now?
Making sure you are safe.
Look, I know things have been bad.
Bad is what things were like when you went in.
Things now, they're worse than ever.
I'm stuck here night after night, too scared to even go home at night.
Why didn't you just leave?
Get the hell out of Bucharest?
I knew I'd never see you again.
And you never woulda had a chance to slap me, right?
Not in the mood for a lap dance?
Bumbledor gave me one in the car.
Uh, he's more the kinda guy that would stay home with the wife.
Feel better?
Like new.
Kat's up to speed, so we're ready when you are.
What?
She's part of the crew?
Why else do you think we're here?
You know it's work.
You can expense that.
Let me guess, Harker family reunion.
When I heard you were out,
I had a sudden craving to see you.
Is that supposed to scare me?
It's okay.
Marius here, he's all talk.
Hardly put up a fight the last time we met.
Do you think we'll let you walk freely after what you did?
He served his time.
Now take a step back.
Killed my father.
You mean the sick bastard that turned you...
Show yourself in our district and we'll bleed you dry.
Yeah?
You come near me again.
And you'll what?
Sick your slut on me?
I'm sorry, what?
She didn't tell you.
Your girl has been making enemies since you left.
Keep talking, Marius.
I swear to God I will rip your head off and stick it right up your...
Okay, I'm a cop, so try to cool it on the death threats.
Keep working with him, and my kind will turn on you.
Derricks!
Derricks!
Bouncers are missing.
There's blood.
And I don't suppose you know anything about that?
You're ours, Harker.
You and your merry band.
Go.
You know I released you on one condition.
That leech just killed two people
We don't know that.
Hey, low-profile.
How's this for low-profile?
Semi-automatic, nine millimeter, hollow points.
Not bad.
Haven't told you the best part, mercury tips.
Mercury?
- The vapor in the bulb.
- Yeah.
To them it's poison.
To us it's poison.
I thought it's always silver, vampires' weakness?
What do you think they called mercury back in the day?
Quicksilver.
Shoot 'em with enough of these, they'll boil out from the inside.
- So what else you have in there?
- We should go.
Yeah, I'm driving.
Keys.
- What?
Great.
It seems Harker and his friends are back to their old tricks.
We should tell Nikolai.
Listen.
Aleksandr.
Hey, we're just here for information, not to get vampire blood on the hands.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You should know that those things in there, they don't care you're a cop.
To them, blood is blood.
Okay?
We need to speak to whoever's in charge.
Back of the line, bleeders.
This is official police business.
I know your people can't hear for crap, so let me try again.
You're not on the list.
I'd check again.
Didn't you read the sign outside?
No soliciting.
We're not selling Girl Scout cookies.
We just want to talk.
Surrender your weapons.
You won't be harmed, you have my word.
Don't trust him.
You force your way into our house at gunpoint with the Vampirdzhiya.
Give me a reason to trust you.
We're not giving up our guns.
Yeah we are.
Remember why we're here.
All of you.
Do it.
I think I prefer being in prison.
Just you.
Harker, too.
Trust me, he's better where I can keep an eye on him.
How old is this place?
Older than Bucuresti itself.
Older than the Kazikle Voyvoda.
Older than the Kazikle Voyvoda.
The "impaler Prince...
Vlad the Impaler.
And his Ordinul Draculya.
"Order of the Dragon...
Dracula?
So who does that make you, then?
I am Anghel.
I had the honor to serve during the Carpathian Campaign.
My father is six hundred years old.
Dude, you don't look a day over two-fifty.
You better have good reason for bringing humans here.
For bringing him here.
Three vampires were killed last night, torn limb from limb.
They were buying human blood on the black market.
The past week, there's been easily a dozen murders, both human and vampire.
Though, from the look on both your faces, this isn't news.
What isn't news to us, Detective, is that human police don't care about crimes against vampires,
but now that humans are also being targeted, here you are.
I believe the distribution of this black market blood has led to certain impurities.
I don't follow.
A contaminated blood sample has spread through our people not unlike one of your sexually transmitted diseases.
The infected appear to be turning into a primitive subspecies, acting only on their most primal urges, turning our genes against us.
Like some kind of retrovirus.
So, what are you saying exactly?
I think they're saying there's life-size vampire bats flying around Bucharest, sucking it dry.
I guess that's where I come in.
Vampire metabolism is already must faster than a human's, but these vampire bats, as you call them, their needs are much higher.
Their blood thirst, insatiable.
One of my own sons has gone missing.
I fear he has fallen into their ranks.
So how do we stop 'em?
You can't, human.
Oh, and you can?
We are somewhat limited by our nocturnal tendencies, but you can track these creatures during the day while they slumber.
Of course, they'll tear you apart if you do.
Yeah.
We'll take our chances.
We should work together.
What?
That is not what I signed up for.
You signed up to kill vampires, and as far as I can tell, these are about as pure vampire as they get.
I do not wish them killed.
You must understand we don't have any choice.
Nikolai will help you find them if you will help us try to save them.
Good luck, Detective Derricks.
It's not part of the deal.
We work alone.
Actually, you work for me now.
We don't need them.
Wait, is that you?
Fire of eighteen forty-seven.
Humans burnt down half the city.
That was the last time we revealed ourselves.
Jury's still out if things will be any different this time around.
Vanatorii Umane.
It's time.
Vanatorii Umane?
Human hunters.
Not all humans, just the ones you brought with you.
Don't worry, Detective.
They're off the clock.
Where's Marius?
Find him.
Found him.
I'm sorry.
I brought them here.
Get out!
Harke r!
Hey!
Hey!
Faster metabolism apparently means they die faster.
Nice.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
What are you doing?
He could lead us to the others.
Aleksandr?
That's not Aleksandr anymore.
Brother, we only want to help you.
No!
I told you we wanted him alive.
Tracking bullet.
You should have said so.
- How do we track him?
- Equipment's back at the...
Where?
Your hide out?
No.
No.
We are not taking them back there.
Why not?
You already know where we live.
That's not the same and you know it.
The hell it's not.
If we're working together, we're working together.
Good thinking using that tracking bullet.
Good thinking using that tracking bullet.
I expected a bit more.
It's no six hundred-year old disco.
Looks like he's moving along Rahovei through Ferentari.
If he removes the tracking dart?
No, transmitters are already his blood stream.
Not bad.
At least you're bringing something to the table.
So, uh, who pays for all this?
We bought stock in SanguiTech.
Pharmaceutical company behind the synth blood?
We got in early.
And no, the irony's not lost on me.
So where are we with our guy?
He stopped moving somewhere here, in the sewers below the processing plant in Rahova.
That's where their colony must be.
When you say "colony," how many do you think there are?
Hard to say.
Well how many of you are missing?
Right, hard to say.
You still don't want us knowing how many of you there actually are.
You're still getting used to the idea that you know about us at all.
Let's just say there may be more of them out there.
A lot more.
Okay.
We should gear up, get back out.
Not until sunrise.
Not if you want to survive.
I guess patience isn't one of your virtues, Harker.
Well, it's definitely one of yours.
I mean, without us you'd be still sipping on cocktails waiting for someone else to find your brother for you.
Don't worry about it, leech.
They won't be the first vampires
I've enjoyed killing, just the ugliest.
Don't think I didn't see what happened back at the club.
You might not have killed Marius, but you may as well have.
Once this so-called alliance is over, you and I are going to discuss it.
Really?
Why wait?
Okay, okay.
We may have some time to kill, but let's not kill each other, yeah?
What?
He started it.
Some slumber party.
Did you think we slept upside-down, hanging from the rafters?
Those things'll kill you.
You really need to worry?
What happened to getting some rest?
I guess I'm just restless.
I can see that.
So your ex, what's the story there?
What makes you think there's a story?
She got sick a few years ago.
Doctors didn't give her long.
I was desperate.
I knew she'd say no, so I didn't give her a choice.
You had her turned?
I knew she'd object, so I did it while she slept.
She woke up a vampire.
She's out there somewhere.
You'll find her.
You know, the thing is, I wouldn't even know what to say to her if I did.
I'm sure you will.
That's real, isn't it?
Can I ask you something?
Why do you hate the vampires so much?
Is that a real question?
You could have left town, like so many others.
People shouldn't have to leave their own cities.
They shouldn't have to live in fear.
Are you frightened of me?
Yes.
Good.
Is this okay, us talking like this?
Like what?
You know, like a couple of people.
We are a couple of people.
No, I know.
That's not what I meant.
It's just...
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
What's it like out there?
If I didn't know better, I'd say
- your sister's flirting with Nikolai.
- What?
I'm sure they're just passing time.
Perfect.
I don't know about you, but I could use a shower.
You coming?
Derricks has involved the vampires.
They're moving on the sewers at sunrise.
Understood.
I'll make sure.
The signal stopped moving four hundred meters south by southwest.
Well, this is nice.
We got enough C-Four to take out half of Sector Five.
But, I'm sure it won't come to that.
Remember, we want Aleksandr alive.
- I'll take the lead.
- Nikolai...
You can't see in the dark.
- That's why we have flashlights.
What am I here for, then?
Bitching, apparently.
Fine.
By all means.
A hundred meters this way.
I'm sorry.
I can smell them.
Means they can smell us, too.
From here on out, silence.
Flashlights off.
Harke r?
Wait.
My brother is in here.
Let me find him first.
What about the rest of them?
Plant your charges, but give me the detonator.
Come on.
Come on!
Okay, come on.
Okay, okay.
Go, go, 90-
Come on!
Go!
Go, go, go!
They're getting through!
Fire in the hole!
They're giving UP-
They'll be back, once they find another way around.
Okay, we get outta here while we still can.
- No.
- No?
You saw the size of that colony.
There were hundreds of them.
This is our chance to wipe 'em all out at once.
He's right, Harker.
If we leave now, they'll move the colony before we get back.
We must detonate the explosives.
You're the one that dropped the damn thing.
You go get it.
Unless it wasn't an accident.
We don't need the detonator.
We just need someone to get close enough to blow one of the C-Four bricks.
Blowing one of the bricks will set off a chain reaction to take out the rest of them, too.
This has the biggest range.
Who's our best shot?
My eyesight is twice as sensitive as yours.
How do we even know you're gonna take the shot?
- Harker?
- Just cover me.
- How close you need to get?
- The door.
At that distance you're going to blow yourself up.
Let's just get him to the door.
I can't get a clean shot.
We need that detonator.
Let's clear a path.
Follow up on me.
Go.
Brother.
No.
Know what you're doing?
Everyone out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Andrei?
Harker, just go!
Something's blocking the door!
Anytime, Harker!
It's stuck!
Here!
Go!
She's gone.
They're all gone.
I couldn't save any of them.
Aleksandr is gone.
He gave his life for us.
That proves he died your brother and not one of those things.
You need to stop hurting yourself and cover up.
Harke r?
He's a dead man.
He will pay for what he did to Andrei, I promise.
But right now we need him alive.
Harke r!
You better lock him up somewhere I can't find him.
- What is the meaning of this?
- You tell me.
Lieutenant?
He was waiting for us.
As we took out the colony, he was waiting to trap us in there with those creatures.
Vampires are a disease!
They have no business living amongst us.
It wasn't just the vampires, was it?
I was in there.
Please, please, please, please.
Get him out of here.
Okay.
Well, this will be an embarrassment to the department.
People are dead because of him!
I think we can both use one of these?
Someone must be responsible for the tainted blood.
Tainted blood?
The black market blood.
Some of it's tainted and infected with something that alters the vampires' DNA, turns them into these full-on monsters.
Damn blood dealer.
Now killing the infected won't stop others from getting sick or- or changing.
We need to find the source.
And who knows if that was even the only colony.
Colony?
There are colonies?
Unless the poor bastard downstairs is the last.
You brought one here?
The examination room, yeah.
I gotta tell ya, he's a little crispy.
Ah, well.
Good work, Detective.
I think any loose ends can wait till tomorrow.
Uh, get some rest.
Eh, one last thing, what of the Vampirdzhiya?
They're still under my watch, just in case.
Okay.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- I'm taking a nap.
No, there's no time.
There's not long till sundown.
What are you talking about?
Johnny, no.
Wait, what are you talking about?
He wants to go back to Nikolai's nightclub.
What?
Why?
That crypt is one of the largest in Bucharest.
It could be connected to a dozen more, for all we know.
But we do know this much, where we can hit 'em where it's gonna hurt.
After everything we've been through?
Okay, Celeste.
Shoot.
What have we been through that's been so life-altering?
Two years in a cell, Johnny.
It gave me a long time to think.
Well, did you think about what Dad would say if he found out that you were falling for one of them?
Huh?
Do you think that'd give him some sort of comfort while he was visiting Mom's grave?
'N.
I'm with Celeste.
Nothing's clear anymore.
Have you looked around lately?
There's more of them every single day.
More and more humans will continue to go over to their side until one day there will be nobody left on ours.
Look, we've all had a long couple of days...
Don't.
Do I need to remind you, they know we know where they live.
We know where they live.
And now, they know where we live.
Hey, look at me.
Too scared to go home at night.
That's what you said.
Do you really wanna go on living like that?
No.
Do you ever sleep, Detective?
After today, I'm not so sure.
It's a dark one.
You shoulda seen him before he got the tan.
What can you tell us about it?
This thing represents a complete regression of the vampire genome.
The question is, what triggered it?
The infected blood sample?
If this were an isolated case, sure.
But for it to spread to so many, so quickly, this outbreak must have had more than one original carrier.
In fact, I'm even inclined to say that this is no accident at all.
It's more like a large scale demonstration of some kind...
Excuse me.
Derricks.
Derricks, Derricks, he's out of control.
You've got to stop him.
Whoa, Celeste, slow down.
Start over.
Johnny and Kat are on their way to Nikolai's.
What, Why?
Well, why do you think?
Well, why didn't you stop them?
They tied me to a chair for my own good.
All right, I'm on it.
- Derricks, there's more.
Well do I even wanna know?
I'm pretty sure half the city's about to come under siege.
What are you talking about?
There are more of them than we thought, Derricks.
A lot more.
Hang on.
You're gonna wanna hear this, Celeste Harker.
Celeste, you're on speakerphone.
As you were saying, there's a lot more of these?
A lot more.
At least half a dozen colonies across Sector Five, just like the one we saw today.
No, that's impossible.
I'm seeing massive movement beneath the city streets.
We've got hundreds of those things descending on Rahova.
Okay Celeste, thank you.
Hang tight.
Look.
Every advantage vampires have speed, strength, hearing, even the paralytic agent in their saliva this guy had in spades.
This guy had in spades.
So if there really are hundreds of these things out there.
We need to order an evacuation.
I think perhaps you are delirious from fatigue.
What did you not hear her?
I cannot order an evacuation of Bucharest and incite a panic...
Not the entire city.
Not the entire city, no, but Rahova, Ferentari.
There are ten thousand people at least still living there, and easily twice that many vampires.
You have a point.
Would you excuse us, please?
If what Miss Harker says is true,
I think this represents an opportunity for us to rid the city of these creatures before they spread to more densely populated areas.
Thirty thousand vampires and vagrants.
Small price to pay, don't you think?
Harker's still out there.
He's my responsibility.
Him and his sister.
I'm gonna bring him in.
If you feel you must.
Detective, just be careful.
We don't have to do this.
Then what are we doing?
Are we not still the Vampirdzhiya?
Have you forgotten why we do this?
We were scared back then.
We both lost people close to us.
Yeah.
What's changed?
I have to do this.
Even without you.
It was supposed to be a cure.
But it wasn't, was it?
It was a virus, and you went forward anyway.
Different means, same end.
To rid the world of vampires?
Do you know what I see when I look out that window, Detective?
Fear.
I see a city paralyzed by fear.
And now there are reports of vampires in London, Budapest, Prague, Barcelona.
Make no mistake, they are spreading.
They are the virus.
They represent the end of everything we have built.
Everything we know.
Surely you must see that.
We are going to take back our country.
But it never was your country, was it?
Vlad the Impaler was a damn vampire.
I knew it was a risk to put you on this case.
I need to know where you stand in regard to these monsters.
My wife is one of these monsters.
Yes, she is.
I am sorry for you.
Detective, please.
If it's any consolation, I will make sure you are here with your friends when it all goes down.
This isn't the Romanian Revolution, Kovaks.
Isn't it, though?
Take down Detective Derricks.
I repeat, take down Detective Derricks.
You?
Why are you helping me?
I saw you at the club last night.
You were with Nikolai and the others.
Open the door now.
If I don't make it out of here, you've got to give Anghel a message.
The synth blood is contaminated.
Kovaks and whoever he's working with are behind it.
They're the reason his son is dead.
Tell him yourself, just go through a window.
Go!
They won't show you any mercy.
And I won't show them any.
They gotta be down below, sleeping.
Really, Harker?
Too predictable.
Yeah, you might get us in a rush, but not before we take most of you with us, and your crypt.
Shame it has come to this.
It didn't have to, you know.
You would've done the same, eventually.
There's still a way out of this, for both of you.
You gotta be kidding me, right?
It's your choice, Harker.
Join us, or die.
But either way,
I'm gonna turn your sister, and she's gonna like it.
Try doing it from the next life.
Harker!
Been out of jail now for what, thirty-six hours?
Are you really in that much of a hurry to die?
What?
You forget what side you're on?
The only side you've been on Johnny is your own.
Human, vampire, you want it to be that simple, but it's not.
Now lower your weapons.
Lower your weapons.
Now shut your mouth for five damn minutes.
If you still want to die,
I'll shoot you myself.
No need to be so rude about it.
You too.
Give me five minutes before your Vanatorii Umane do anything drastic.
Why should I?
Because what I'm about to tell your father changes everything, and I don't want my team killing each other in the meantime.
You know the way, Detective.
It pleases me to see you alive.
Pleases me as well.
Anghel...
Nikolai told me you did everything you could.
Even so, I'm sorry.
Did you learn anything?
You could say that.
Tell me everything you know.
Peacekeepers in place.
The complex is locked down.
Derricks nearly ruined our plans, but in the end, he simply accelerated our time table.
Now, we wait.
These are disturbing developments, but not entirely surprising.
Kovaks is willing to sit back and sacrifice hundreds of humans just to turn public against you.
We have to expose the truth.
What we need to do is warn people.
Humans, and vampires alike.
Otherwise it won't even matter.
Once again, I am in your debt.
I'm just doin' my job.
Nevertheless, allow me to do something for you.
Cass, is that really you?
Hello, again.
You look...
The same?
Is this, um...
Do you live here?
It doesn't exactly work like that with us.
I drive through Ferentari every night, past the vampires, and the blood dealers, and the homeless.
I've seen your face a thousand times, but it was never you.
How can you be sure?
What I did to you, was unforgiveable.
But that doesn't mean I don't want you to forgive me.
I want to thank you.
No.
I was selfish.
I just didn't want to lose you, and I still lost you anyway.
You never lost me, Terry.
And you'll never have to.
I just don't know if that life's for me.
I know.
But, think about it.
You know where to find rne now.
What have we done?
We didn't do this, Kovaks did.
All units, all units, we have multiple disturbances in Rahova, Ferentari, Odai.
Please respond.
Half the city's under siege, where do we even start?
- Celeste.
- Celeste.
We're quicker on foot from here.
HEY' 'bout time you have a real weapon.
Come on!
This is almost fun!
I'm starting to not hate you as much!
Just so you know, the feeling's not mutual.
Good.
Come on!
Come on you bastards.
Is that all you got?
Whoa, what about my hug?
Oh, I'm sorry Johnny, I almost forgot.
What are you, psychotic?
First of all, ow.
And secondly...
I could have been killed!
You're fine.
There's something you need to see.
Whoa, what is that?
Those are the blood transmitters we've injected into Aleksandr.
They've been passed on exponentially.
Wait, you're telling me that each one of these is a vampire bat?
They're being drawn into the heart of Ferentari.
- Vamp central.
- Why?
Some kind of ultrasonic signal, but here's the interesting part.
The signal is only being relayed there.
It's actually originating here.
The Vampire Relations building?
- Someone's doing this on purpose.
That son of a bitch isn't just letting it happen, he's making it happen.
We have to stop that signal before this thing turns into a massacre.
We need to get in there tonight.
Well I can get us in there, but getting out, now that might be tricky.
By now, Kovaks will have the entire complex locked down tight.
He'll have snipers on the rooftops in case any vampire bats get too close.
Peacekeepers will be at the entrance.
The signal emitter should be on the rooftop along with more guards, but the moment we break in, they'll activate the UV lights.
That's going to be a problem.
That's why we're going to cut power to the entire city grid.
So no one can see?
They can.
Turn out the lights and we'll have the upper hand, but like everything else, the vampire bats will have the same advantage, only more so.
We're going to need backup on this one.
A lot of it.
You'll have it.
So, whaddya think?
Hell, I should be in prison right now anyway.
Why not?
I believe they're here.
Masks down!
Don't worry, they're just unconscious.
I can hear their heartbeats.
The control room should be right up ahead.
That's where we shut down the signal.
I think we've got a problem.
I'm seeing a lot of movement.
Tell me that's not what I think it is.
Transmitter must need full power to operate, and since we cut primary power to the building.
The vampire bats are all coming here now, and fast.
Then let's get that signal shut off, then, sooner rather than later.
Can you shut it down?
Got it.
Wait.
If I don't press this button right now, every two hundred pound vampire bat in Bucharest is gonna be here in the new few minutes.
Exactly.
Even for you, Harker, you're not making a lot of sense.
Let's say we shut off the signal.
What then?
The bats leave, we survive.
I got a better idea.
We blow the building.
That way they're all in the same place at the same time.
This is how we end it.
Tonight.
Are we really considering this?
Well, we wouldn't have to blow the entire building.
Just the transmitter on the roof.
That's actually not bad, Harker.
So... how do we do this, exactly?
With a little luck, and a lot of C-Four.
Kat!
I'm a little busy here, Johnny!
You appear to have brought some new friends with you this time.
You had to know the truth will come out.
Of course.
So genocide was something you wanted on your resume.
Is it really genocide when the survival of one's own species is at stake?
Or simply self-preservation?
Either way, that's not for you to decide.
Hey guys?
Go ahead, Celeste.
Uh, we got another problem.
This is bigger than you or me, Detective.
Much, much bigger.
Kat!
Katya!
John, we have to go.
Yeah.
When the main power came back on, so did the transmitter relay.
It's sending the bats back downtown.
You can't shut it off?
Not without the code.
You can't threaten me.
You know I would rather die than fail.
They're not mutually exclusive, by the way.
The code, Kovaks.
Now.
You know, sometimes we have to make decisions for others for their own good.
Don't you agree, Detective?
Oh, by the way, how is your wife?
I made a choice, and I've had to live with that, but that's got nothing to do with this.
Well, I think we should find out.
No!
I'm not going to shoot anyone else.
I have made my point.
What point?
She's dying.
No, there's gotta be something we can do.
There is.
No.
No, there's got to be something else.
A hospital or something we can help her!
Celeste, Celeste, talk to me!
Celeste!
Whoa, Harker, Harker.
Wait.
Think.
We need him.
We're losing her.
What do I do?
You can't make that decision for her.
Johnny...
Hey.
Celeste, tell me what I should do.
Celeste.
Save her.
Save her.
Please.
Your body's healing itself.
You're weak, but you'll be fine.
Johnny...
Sorry.
I couldn't stand to lose you.
You have nothing to be sorry for.
As I said, my point is made.
Is it so wrong to choose life?
No, and therein lies the dilemma.
If they survive, we do not.
If that's the way it's gonna go down, so be it.
Perhaps.
But I will let history be the judge of me, not you.
It's all right, I'm fine.
You may not be scared of dying, but you are scared of one thing becoming one of us.
You wouldn't.
The code, Kovaks, or become what you hate.
Okay.
Okay.
It's working.
The bats are doubling back again towards the roof.
What are you doing?
What is this?
A choice.
There's enough C-Four on the roof of this building to vaporize the top three floors.
Hey Harker, remind me, what floor are we on?
Top floor, boss.
So like I was saying, that there in your hand is a detonator, which you'll probably want to press once this place is crawling with those things you helped create, or if you really want to make a statement,
don't press it.
Just let the monsters eat you alive and you'll have high schools named after you and people will know you died for a cause you truly believe in.
And how do you know
I won't press it right now and blow us all to hell?
Because you still think you're making it out of this alive, and hope can be a real bitch like that.
So like I said, you got a choice.
You can't...
Shit.
Boss, what happened to you?
Shh!
Keep it down and come over here and get me out of this!
So how did you know?
How could you be sure Kovaks would blow the roof?
Kovaks was a coward.
I was pretty sure he'd take the easy way out.
And I had a second detonatorjust in case.
Well the next few days should be, urn... interesting.
It'll probably get worse before it gets better.
But vampires and humans will continue living side-by-side.
But will it last?
Does anything?
We had better go.
I've seen my last sunrise, haven't I?
I know Katya would have taken the same deal if she'd been given the chance.
You're still here and I'm grateful for that.
Bye Johnny.
Wait,
I'm coming with you.
'Bout time I said "hey" to my wife.
For the past few years, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and Karl Pilkington have been meeting regularly for a series of pointless conversations.
This is one of them.
Testing.
Is that all right?
Hello, and welcome to The Ricky Gervais Show, with me, Ricky Gervais,
Stephen Merchant...
Hello.
And a little round-headed buffoon.
That is...
Karl Pilkington.
Right.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to calm my gums down.
Well, you don't do it with water.
What do you do it with?
You're trying to calm you gums down with...
You do it with...
You do it with meditation and hard drugs.
What's the problem with your gums?
When I'm stressed out, my teeth know.
What?
What do you mean?
Say that again.
When I'm sort of stressed out, me, me gums and my teeth know before I do.
It's like a weakness.
So what's up?
You got a toothache then?
Mmm.
I did the other week.
I thought you went to the dentist?
Well, what's wrong with your teeth then?
It's just cause you're stressed?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why are you stressed?
What have you got to be stressed about?
I don't know.
That's, that's what, that's what's weird with stress, isn't it?
No.
Your body can be stressed without your realizing.
That's what kills people.
No, stress.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're stressed, because you feel stressed, and then, your body gets weak, because you're...
No, because I'm pretty good.
I don't...
I never feel stressed.
That's part of my problem.
That's not a problem.
I am stressed, but I don't know about.
That doesn't make sense at all.
That's why...
It's a number one killer.
What?
What do you mean?
Do you never get stressed?
If you don't feel stressed, how are you stressed?
But you must be stressed if your teeth are telling you you're stressed.
Right.
It's like saying, I didn't feel like I had the pain, but apparently, I did.
Listen.
Go on.
- I was in Israel recently.
- Hmm.
Had a bag put over me head, chucked in the back of a van.
- Now the thing is, I kind of thought, well, this is...
- Right.
It wasn't a blind date, by the way.
And he wasn't being arrested or kidnapped.
It was a, it was a training thing, wasn't it, for kidnap situations?
Yes, but I didn't know.
I didn't know...
What?
You didn't know they were going to do it?
No.
Brilliant.
They don't tell me anything, do they?
- That's good.
- So what happened then?
So, the thing is, that happened, I had a panic on a little bit.
Afterwards, they took the bag off.
I realized everything was all right.
I was calm.
But my body was shaking.
And that's what I'm saying to you.
That doesn't make any sense.
My body, as far as my body was concerned, it had just been kidnapped.
Right.
But I knew I hadn't.
The, you know the bag they put over your head?
Was it like a tennis racket cover?
What, what shape was it?
You sure they just didn't go with...
Oh, I thought I just bought the world's biggest orange.
Do you ever get recognized much?
Yeah, now and again.
But I haven't done anything of any worth.
However, it's almost like recognizing a neighbor or something.
Cause they sort of go, oh, it's him.
And then the other one might go, what does he do?
Oh, I don't know.
It's not like I've done something...
Right, of any worth.
Of any worth yet.
Yeah.
I think you're forgetting all those emails I pass on to you.
For those people that have had traumas in their lives.
You know, the earthquake victim.
There's people that have lost relatives or had...
You know, terrible life threatening diseases.
And they say the podcast got them through.
Doesn't that warm the cockles of your heart?
Uh, well, normally it's, it's gone straight to you, hasn't it?
And you just forwarded me on.
So it's, it's almost like spam to me.
It doesn't, it doesn't feel as special, cause it's like, here you go.
Look at this, you know?
Unbelievable.
I've watched the World Cup a few times with Ricky, the last time we qualified.
We were doing, um, a project.
And then we were, we watched it together in a hotel room.
But of course in a hotel room, it was just like a big bed.
So, we sat on the bed together, and we thought that was a bit intense.
So I put a line of pillows down.
But I don't understand what, to...
He was putting a line of pillows between us.
Now he knows I'm not going to jump on him.
No, I know.
No.
He's not going to jump on me.
But he's still terrified that some kind of...
Like some kind of paparazzi is going to sort of parasail down the building.
And peer in and take a photo of us.
And that's before we've got time to explain that we're just watching the football.
It's already printed going, "Well, this is clearly evidence that they're gay."
Yeah.
There's no way that they could possibly...
Sat on a bed just as friends.
No, but hold on, though.
Why were we naked?
Why didn't we just pop some trousers on?
But I didn't remember that you, even though it was my room...
You forced me to sit in the chair.
It was one of those really uncomfortable box chairs.
I said, it's weird.
I can't get excited.
We're having a beer, okay?
So, now we're drinking.
Now we're drinking in bed, on the bed.
We weren't in bed.
No, no, no.
We had our clothes on.
We're on the bed watching football.
But I couldn't go, "Come on England," with a little man sitting next to me in bed.
Not a little man at all.
No.
Big man.
And so I just thought, "Let's pop the pillows down." That wasn't enough.
I said, Steve, I can't do this.
I can't...
I can't watch football with a man on a bed.
I said, so go in the chair.
And he sat in the chair.
So I sat in this chair, which is...
For a man of my size, those tiny little, crappy hotel box chairs are no good.
It's 90 bloody minutes, plus the...
It was my room.
I was furious.
I felt like I was, like an old rich man just waiting to die.
And my little, man servant used to come and sit and watch football with me...
- Exactly.
Yes.
- ...in the last days...
The last days.
...of my time.
Karl, would you sit on a bed, right, with Stephen in a hotel room, right, watching football?
Okay?
You're pouring, you're pouring each other wine, and beer, and...
Well, no.
There wasn't that music playing.
There was the roar of the crowd, and John Motson doing commentary.
It wasn't, it's the not the sexy sound at all.
What do you think, Karl?
Um...
Someone said, oh, come to my room.
We're watching football.
You got there and he went...
Well, who was on the bed first?
But, that's not what happened.
Who was on the bed first?
Well, he probably got up to answer the door.
So he, so...
So, I don't know.
I came in.
I thought, well, there's only a bed here.
We sat down.
We thought, yes, we...
No it wasn't.
It was a chair there.
So...
Well, yeah.
But you know full well that if you're in a room with Ricky, he's the one who's going to leap straight on the bed and demand that you...
I'd just take the chair.
Well, why would you be concerned with lying on the bed next to me?
Yeah.
What's up with that?
It's a bit weird, isn't it?
Why?
Why is it weird?
I don't understand this.
Because...
I changed my tune.
It's a bit weird lying on a bed, with a mate, just watching football.
Yes, it isn't like when you go around the house, do you?
You don't pop on...
Yes, but it's because you have a sofa and things.
We didn't have that in the room.
Yes, but when you visit, someone in hospital, you don't say, "Move over."
And you probably don't pop yourself down next to him.
You sit on the chair next to it.
No.
Because you're not there in a relaxed situation for 90 minutes...
Enjoying a game of sport.
It's a, there's a more formal environment.
Cause you're quite a sport fan, aren't you, Karl?
Yes, but not in, um...
I, I don't like getting into things too much.
Mmm.
Cause it can be disappointing.
Well, that's true.
I've never seen him get into anything.
No.
To be quite honest.
No.
I am a football fan.
But I've gotten, I've got, I've got it now to a point, where...
If they lose, it only bothers me for about half an hour.
Yeah.
And then I move on.
Because the thing is, I'm not in control of it.
- There's nothing I can do to alter that, that team.
- No.
If I could go in and say, listen, you're lazy.
You get your finger out.
You move up front a bit.
It's different.
But it's totally...
It's like getting annoyed with nature.
There's nothing you can do.
So let it happen.
Watch it if you want.
But don't get annoyed about it, cause it's totally out your hands.
Yeah.
Interesting that Karl's team tactics also sounds like he could be directing a gay porn.
You get your finger out.
You get up front.
You're lazy.
Oh, it's amazing.
What do you think of these people, though?
I love it that everyone's a, an expert.
Everyone's a pundit.
You see these fat people in pubs going...
Well, he's lost a few yards up front.
Yeah.
You, you be...
You fucking score a goal then, fatty.
Mmm.
Wearing a football top.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
I hate that.
They shouldn't make them for them.
Shouldn't make them in that size.
It should be one size only.
If you're fit enough to play football, you can wear one.
If you're a fatty, you not.
You look ridiculous anyway.
But what's that, that's...
What are you talking about?
So you with a big, fat slob with his belly out in an England shirt...
Going, "I could score from there."
Go on then.
Let's have a go.
If fat Bob in the pub...
Mmm.
He's got his football top on.
Mmm.
Just.
He gets all annoyed when England, you know, lose.
Mmm.
Yeah.
What difference it make...
What difference does it make if they lose there, or lose in the final?
Well, I'll...
What's the point?
Well, I'll tell you what difference it makes.
I knew a fat Bob, okay?
That wasn't his name, but I'm changing the name to protect the innocent, and him.
And he's not innocent, right?
Is it fat Dave?
It was a big, fat bloke, right?
And he worked on one of the crews, um...
That used to bring in equipment where I used to work at that student's union, okay?
And, uh, he was, he was massive, right?
And, uh, I think it was 1992.
The Euro.
Right?
When England got knocked out.
And he went mental.
And he was so angry.
He went out, and he wanted retribution, okay?
Luckily there were no German people around.
But the closest he, he could find was a sausage van.
Some poor bloke who delivers sausages, and he turned it over.
He got the van, and he turned it over cause it was selling sausages.
So he thought that's German enough.
No.
Well, if he's fat, he's probably just annoyed that it wasn't open.
I think I first became really excited by the World Cup, that famous year when Maradona did the hand ball.
Do you remember, what was that, 1986?
'86.
Yeah.
Oh, that was so exciting.
Cause it was...
He had been so brilliant in that tournament.
And then he did cheat, as we all know.
Yeah.
Isn't cheating part of, part of all games now?
Hang on.
Here we go.
This is controversial.
Oh, hold on...
There's a lot of young people who look up to Karl as a role model.
Yeah.
Yeah, but it's the world we live in now, isn't it?
It's, uh, get what you can, or how you can.
But what's your feeling?
Are you the sort of person...
Well, I mean, have you ever cheated in a game?
Were you that sort of person?
Um, let me just think.
My dad does it a lot.
Um...
What?
In board games and that?
Yeah.
They're just, just cards.
Monopoly.
- Uh...
- How does he cheat in Monopoly?
Just nicks a lot of the money.
Oh, just straightforward nicks the money.
I hadn't thought of that.
I love that.
Yeah.
But how do you notice he's even doing it?
He does...
I'm busy looking at, you know, what properties I've, I've invested in and stuff.
Sure.
And the money's just there, isn't it?
See I don't see the point of cheating at Monopoly.
No, I don't.
I say that to him.
I'm saying, you're kidding yourself.
You're kidding yourself.
But to him, he's, he's broke the system, hasn't he?
He's got round the rules.
What do you mean I can only have that much?
Who says I can?
Bosh.
Get some more money.
Buy some more hotels.
And in a way, that's life, isn't it?
Mmm.
All people with loads of money now, you kind of go, have they made that honestly?
Right.
You know, I pass big houses in London, and I think gangsters.
Got to be gangsters to have a house like that.
Yeah.
There's no way a normal job, someone who's...
Cause I know.
I'm trying to make money.
And I know how hard it is to make money.
Cause the more money you make, the more hands are out there, taking little bits.
So how the hell has this man bought this house?
It's got to be a crook.
And that's the...
So do you yourself cheat?
Would you consider yourself a cheater?
Are you honorable?
In games.
Well, just generally.
Do you cheat on anything?
No.
Do you know what?
The other week...
I'd had a cup of tea and some fish and chips at this pub.
And they only took for one.
And I went back the next day.
And said, oh, you didn't charge me for my fish and chips.
What a fucking moron.
I paid.
No, I didn't tell her about the tea though.
Got a free tea?
Took the free tea, yeah.
I just thought, well, you know, it's pretty good about going back to pay for that.
And it was just a tea bag.
The water was free.
Yeah.
I'll have that for free.
So that, again, that's just me.
It's like the Mars bar on the paper round.
Mmm.
It's me going, well, I've been good.
The fish would have cost money.
Potatoes are pretty cheap.
But I'll pay for it.
But for my goodness, here's a little gift.
Have a free cup of tea.
If she was good at her job, she'd have remembered.
I thought she would have done.
In a way, it annoyed that she didn't go...
Oh, yes.
So you did.
Well done.
Thank you very much for coming back.
Right.
She just was like, did you?
Another little crap shoot.
She looks at me.
I know what you mean.
She looked, she looked at me, like...
We didn't even know.
Yeah.
I was worrying about a staff member.
Sort of on her own or having to pay for it.
Getting fired or something.
I know where you're coming at there.
Yeah.
One of my first disappointments with football...
I was, um, I was 10-years-old, okay?
And, uh, one of the teachers was in charge of the football team, my junior school.
And I went down to Tuttys.
It was a shop, with my mom.
So it's just white socks, black shorts, white shirt...
Went to, knocked on his door.
I said, I've got my kit.
Yes, well, the trials were yesterday.
You've missed it.
That was it for a year, right?
Next year I went, "When are the trials, when are the trials..."
Got in the trials, okay?
He's going, well, I want everyone to give 100 percent, right?
Really try hard.
Really try hard.
He's watching people play, right?
I made sure that every time I ran by him, I was out of breath, right?
Really trying.
Every time I ran by him he sort of looking at me...
Came to it.
He said, and the team is this.
I'm left out, right?
He went past me, and he went, you've clearly got asthma.
So you didn't make that team either?
Yeah.
And I didn't...
And, and I...
I vowed that day, never try hard at anything.
Yeah.
Well, and you've certainly kept that up.
Yeah.
What's your thoughts on that, Karl?
Well, you play...
Did you play sport at school?
Um, a little bit.
But it was never taken seriously at school anyway.
It was, I think the P.E. teacher was a geography teacher as well.
- So it's like, you know, what does he know?
- Yeah.
It was all that...
Basically, he put on some track suit pants on that were always too tight for him.
Could see everything.
Well, why were you looking at...
You couldn't help it.
It was in the days when clothing was tight as it is.
Mmm.
And then it was like Lycra tracky bottoms.
Oh, all right.
And everyone used to say, look at the...
But...
Like stealing sausages from...
He was ridiculous, ridiculous.
So he didn't know what he was doing anyway.
If, if anything it was dangerous.
Cause he didn't know...
What was, what was the capability of a, of a 10-year-old kid's body.
- I mean, he'd put you through loads of stuff.
- Right.
He didn't like me anyway, cause I wasn't that good.
If you're not that good,
- teachers don't like you.
- Oh, I thought you'd be pretty good.
I wasn't interested.
That's the thing.
I did relay, and I got done for swearing.
Got whacked on the ass with a baton.
Hold on.
Why, why, why were you swearing in relay?
What, when's that come into it?
Why did you need to swear in relay?
You're running round out there...
Because the lads wouldn't slowed down, so I couldn't pass it on.
So I sort of said, fucking slow down.
And he heard me.
And then went mental at me.
But, yeah.
So it was never...
I mean, Darren Campbell...
The, the athlete.
I told you, haven't I, that I was involved in his, his training?
No.
Didn't know about this.
Yeah, Darren Campbell, the...
I think he won a gold medal.
Didn't he used to push you around in a bath or something?
No, it's not Last of the Summer Wine.
It was, it was in me go cart.
Really?
And used to...it was a motorized go cart.
And that's why he'd pick it up at the back.
Run with it, up speed, and then drop the wheels down,
And the engine kicks in.
We should explain to the people who don't know.
He was the bloke who used to push the bob sleigh in the Winter Olympics.
Wasn't he, for the England team?
No.
He was a, he was a runner.
Well, how was that part of his training then, pushing a fucking go cart?
What was he doing?
Because he's running.
But he's running about a yard.
No.
No.
Sometimes more than that, quite a lot.
And it's just...
God, what do you want?
It was Darren Campbell pushing my go cart.
Yeah, but you seem to be taking half the credit for his gold medal.
What you've done is sat on your ass, you lazy twat.
I just kind of think he was, he was at the age where it's important.
He could have made a decision not to go into it at that point.
And I think he was never keen to get in the go cart.
Yeah.
He was always keen to push it, and I used to let him.
Now, if I said, no, I don't want you pushing me go cart, who knows?
I'm just saying I was there at the start.
Doing nothing, providing nothing.
Sitting on your ass.
Sitting around, letting someone else do it.
Well, all right.
What athletes have you helped?
You've not helped him.
I bet if he ever did a book, an autobiography, it'd go, you know, The Early Years, Darren Campbell.
Now I want to know if he has done an autobiography, cause we're going to be looking this up.
"I remember the training."
I'm making a note of that for the next time you do anything.
"Around at Pilkington's."
"Darren Campbell."
"Pushing a go cart."
"Pushing, bald, in crap, cheap..."
Wasn't.
"Go cart."
120 quid it was.
You know how many paper rounds that is?
What I like when, um, you're watching football on the television...
Is if it goes to a close-up of a footballer, it's just kick the ball out, miss the goal, he's gone for a free kick or whatever, if you stay on any footballer for more than 10 seconds,
they will either swear...
- Or gob.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, that's a fact.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've never needed to gob that much.
I don't care how knackered I am, I'm never gobbing like that.
It's weird though.
The other week, I just sat in the garden slobbering...
Just to see if it would ever run out.
And it's amazing.
I don't know where it all comes from.
What is the strangest...
That's extraordinary.
That's amazing.
So that...
Just to see if it would run out?
So now, he's got to the point in his life, where, as a hobby, or a pass time, or just to count down the minutes before he dies...
Yeah.
He sat in the garden...
Creating sputum.
Slathering to see if he'd ever run out.
I mean, that's amazing, Karl.
Where, where does it all come from?
Well, you create it, don't you?
But from what?
I'm always getting done for not drinking enough water.
Salivary glands.
But it's amazing.
Honestly, I just sat like that with my head forward, and just let it drip.
Fuck me.
Wow.
So Suzanne comes into the garden, and all she sees is her boyfriend...
Sad.
Like something from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
Yeah.
Dribbling.
Like something battered around their head with a cricket bat.
No, she was, she was reading something.
Did she, did you answer to back to a dictator?
Yeah.
What'd he do?
Battered me.
You got Trojan up your ass as well.
Yeah, it makes me slather.
No.
Just sat there.
What a fucking mong.
That's extraordinary.
What a div you are.
And I just had my head there, and it continuously...
I think I got bored of it before it stopped.
Oh, God!
I have never heard anything like this.
Oh, God, it's unbelievable.
He just sat there with his head down, slathering.
Letting it just...
That's extraordinary.
You weren't even sort of like gobbing?
You were just letting...
No, just letting it, letting it sort of drop.
So, you've...
You've got nothing else going on in your life, that you've got time to do this?
So your brain wasn't even engaged.
How long were you there for?
I'll tell you what, no joking, probably a good 15 minutes.
Wow.
Fifteen minutes...
- Of sitting with his head forward...
- Amazing.
Letting him salivate back onto the grass.
But you reckon you could do that amount?
I would never do it.
Never do it.
We'll never try.
Never try.
I've never got that amount of time.
I've never, I've, I, I tell you now.
You will never see either of us...
Sat there for no reason in the garden, with our head forward, and our mouth open, seeing how long we can create saliva.
Unless I've just come out of a coma.
Yeah.
Yeah, or a gas attack.
Yeah.
No, I have a lot of...
I'm sort of goz unlimited.
That's a great new dance duo, isn't it?
Please welcome to the stage, it's Goz Unlimited!
Amazing.
What do you think about George Best?
Using up his liver, and then getting another one, and getting pissed again?
Clever.
Well, that's always going to encourage, isn't it?
I've always said that.
What?
The moment we can replace stuff, people just go, oh, sod it.
Like smokers.
What would you do if you gave someone a kidney...
And then, and they started to...
Mess with it.
And you saw them down to the pub again.
Doing drugs and shit, and...
Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't hand it out to someone just, just like that, would I?
I think you should be allowed to say, right, who's it for?
Can I meet them?
Right.
Right.
And then have a chat with them.
Saying, have you learned your lesson?
What I'm going to do...
Okay, okay.
I'm a, I'm a...
I'm a little kid who wants a, a kidney, okay?
Um, and you come to...
I'm on the top of the list.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Good.
Are you going to give me one of your kidneys so I can live?
I don't know...
Well, I'm on top of the list so...
Why is your head so round?
Right.
So, definitely not.
Why?
Definitely not.
He's a little kid.
Look at him.
He's a little kid.
But I need, I need a kidney.
Pale.
He's cheeky, though, isn't he?
Cheeky.
No.
Please.
Please.
Round head.
Lovely little kid.
Lock of hair.
Can I have your kidney?
No, you can't have it, right?
Oh, come on.
You've got two.
Let's see another kid.
- No.
I'm on the top...
- Lesson learned.
I'm top of the fucking list.
Give me one of your kidney's you round-headed twat.
No.
I would not feel bad about walking away from that kid, and saying he could not have a kidney.
So you're going to, you're going to...
Do you know what?
I'm going to take this kidney out now and bin it.
Hey, wait.
Do you know who that kid went on to become?
Go on.
Winston Churchill.
All right.
Well, maybe I helped.
It's like Darren Campbell all over again.
I made him stronger.
I was tough with him.
He saw how tough the world is.
No.
But you didn't.
This is an alternative universe where he died, because you never gave him that kidney.
Yeah.
Yeah, well you can't worry about that then, can you?
If you go, if you're going to start going that far back and forward and stuff.
But I think, I don't know what I'd expect someone to be like.
Just wanting to go, what do you eat?
I'd, I'd say write down your diet.
Oh, yeah.
That one is really...
I'm going to treasure this kidney.
I'm going to treasure it.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
And I'll really work hard, and I'm going to make something of more than you did.
So, um...
So I made this...
You're kidney is going to be a lot better off in me than you, you lazy tosser.
I'll tell you that.
If you want, if you want achievement...
Oh, okay.
Then, you know, I, I'm going to go to school.
I'm going to do really well.
Not like you, you thick, little round-headed shit.
So the quicker you get the fucking kidney out of your useless body, and into mine...
Well... ...we'll all be happy, won't we?
Okay.
Well, I'll go away and think about it for a month.
Well, no.
There you go.
Don't have to get nasty.
Sick of it, always helping people out.
Oh.
Uh...
That's a big ask, isn't it?
Would you give anyone a kidney, Karl?
Suzanne?
Sure he would give Suzanne a kidney.
Tricky little, tricky, tricky.
Well, you, obviously you'd give Suzanne a kidney, wouldn't you?
Yeah...
Well, would you?
Or are you just saying that?
Suppose I would.
I don't really like the idea of it.
So if, what you're saying...
What you're saying to Suzanne right now.
A bit of good luck.
You know, I need a kidney.
And this got quite rare.
Well, we've got the same sort of blood group and everything.
So, uh...
You've got two.
I've got none.
Bibbity Bob, one each.
Let's have a good life.
Don't know.
Yeah?
Uh, yeah, you'll have to, have to have it.
Which one are you thinking of going for?
Cause the...
I think the right one's a bit dodgy cause I had the kidney stones.
Do you want that one?
Well, you keep that.
I'll have, I'll have the left one.
No.
I tell you what.
You have that one, because when I was in all the pain, you were going, it can't be that bad.
So you have it.
It's in good working order.
They've looked at it.
Yeah.
But it is prone to stones.
There.
He's using this to get back at her.
For saying, it can't be that bad.
It's like poetic justice.
He can give her the kidney she didn't believe was that painful.
Don't like talking about it.
It's all...
It freaks me out.
It freaks me out.
It's all doing stuff now.
The kidney is doing stuff.
Yeah.
My teeth are hurting still.
Still got a little bit of tooth ache going on there.
I've got a sweat on.
All stuff is going on without me knowing.
Germs whizzing round.
I've had jabs for rabies.
I've had Hepatitis A and B. I don't know what that does.
I've had A and I've had B. That's whizzing round my body.
Body's in shock, isn't it, at the moment?
It doesn't know what is going on.
I've had...
How is it notifying you of the shock?
Well, the thing, like I say, I keep getting this sweat.
And what else have I had?
Typhoid.
Doesn't that, like shouldn't, I have...
All this stuff shouldn't be in my body, should it?
And we don't really know, do we?
They're saying, yes, have this.
Have that.
Shove it in your arm.
It's all right.
But we don't really know, long-term effect.
I've got rabies in me.
I never thought I'd have to have that.
Tetanus, T.B.
One for if I get bit by a dirty monkey.
Aah!
It's love, isn't it?
Sometimes you walk into a house and you take one look around, and you know.
And you say, "This is for me. "
Oh, I think it's perfect.
It's just what we've been looking for.
There aren't enough plugs.
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman, now.
That place I showed you on Sycamore Street was absolutely, positively loaded with plugs.
That's right.
There were plenty.
But the steps were too high.
When we get older, we could trip.
Every house we look at you find something to pick at.
I just know what I like.
Would you like a divorce?
'Cause I'll bring it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that.
I'm gonna find this house for you.
I am committed to finding the perfect house for you.
I don't care how long it takes.
Because at Evers Evers, we want you to be happy forevers and evers.
Oh, excuse me one second.
Let me take this call.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hello.
Evers Evers Real Estate.
Jim Evers.
Hey, honey.
How's it going?
Do they like the house?
Yes, this house is still available.
Oh, I knew it.
I told you they were lookie-lous.
It's another interested party.
Listen, I'm on my way home to get ready for dinner.
I'm looking forward to tonight.
Well, are you preapproved?
Yeah, the reservation's at 7:00, so don't be late.
Okay.
Well, 7:00 is perfect.
Let's get together at 7:00, and we'll go over your offer.
Okay, honey.
I'll see you later.
See what you did?
We love the house.
We do.
We love it.
Well, then, Mrs. Coleman.
Taking that into consideration, there's only one thing left to do.
Let's sign some papers.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Lorraine and Gary.
Just like I promised, here's the offer.
Signed, sealed, and delivered.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
We are so grateful.
This is a cause for celebration.
Let us buy you a drink.
Oh, no, really, I can't.
My wife's waiting for me.
This is such a big deal for us.
We have to celebrate.
- I really can't.
I'm late.
- We insist.
Please.
Okay.
One quick drink.
Okay.
One quick one.
Sir, can I have a ginger ale over here, please?
Oh, no.
That's not a drink.
Sammy, three Volcanoes.
- Oh, no.
No volcanoes.
- They're incredibly smooth.
Oh, we love it here.
We've been coming here for years.
- It's like Hawaii.
- Yes.
We spent our honeymoon there.
It was fantastic.
Have you been?
- No, never been there.
- Promise me you'll go.
Promise.
I'll go if you sign.
I will go to Hawaii if you sign.
But I got to get going because it's my anniversary tonight.
Your anniversary?
Happy anniversary!
Thank you.
Sign that thing here.
# Happy anniversary #
# Happy anniversary, happy anniversary #
# Happy anniversary #
# Happy, happy, happy, happy #
Hey, sign this!
Okay, Jim.
- Sorry about that.
- No.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Aloha.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Oh, excuse me.
Did I hear you correctly?
Did you just sell their house?
I sure did.
'Cause we're looking to buy.
Honey, forgive me.
Well, I'm Jim Evers of Evers Evers Real Estate.
Tell me about your dream house.
Hi, Sara.
My name's Teddy.
Your husband told me to tell you he loves you very much, but sometimes he loses track of the time.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Yes.
Look at what he brought you.
Look at that.
Isn't that pretty?
Oh, you know, you have a wonderful husband that thinks about you like that on your anniversaries.
You're so fortunate!
It's beautiful.
It's actually Teddy's fault that I'm late.
He had a little accident in the backseat, cotton all over the place, but I cleaned it up.
It's okay.
I forgive Teddy.
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that.
I'm on a roll here.
We sold seven houses this month.
What about the three soccer games, two birthday parties, and barbecue you missed?
Did I miss that much stuff this month?
Okay.
We're gonna take off this weekend.
What?
We're gonna take off and go down to the lake like we did last year with the kids for the whole weekend.
- How's that sound?
- Can we really close on this?
Yes.
How about this?
We can close on this.
How about this?
Close on that.
Let me go tell the kids.
All right?
Okay.
All right.
Megan and Michael, big family adventure!
Hey!
Michael Jordan Evers!
Aah!
Aah!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Dad!
There's a...
- What is it?
- There's a spider in my room!
- There's a what?
There's a spider in my room on the window.
Why don't you kill it, man?
That's a big spider!
Come on.
It's just a spider, Michael.
How big could it be?
What is this?
Where's the spider at?
What?
Man, you're acting like it's Mothra.
It's just a spider.
You're making a big deal out of nothing, Michael.
You're 10 years old.
It's time I teach you how to kill a spider the right way.
The most efficient way to crush a spider.
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.
Some people like to use "Life" or "Time" or...
This is my "Sports lllustrated" Swimsuit Edition.
What are you doing with it?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, right.
If you can look at this, you should have enough courage to kill a spider the right way.
So I'm gonna roll this up so you get a good grip on it.
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.
That's where you can really get some good action going.
You want to come across like that so you really crush it.
You come across this way so you get his whole escape route in case he try to go...
You take it, and you whack it.
Go on.
Whack the spider.
I don't want to whack it.
Come on, you got to whack the spider, Mike.
Whack it.
Dad, I'm afraid of spiders.
I can't whack it.
Let me explain something to you.
All your life you're gonna be facing spiders, okay?
I am?
What I'm trying to say is you should never be afraid.
People know, they use that against you.
I'm not scared of anything.
I'm your dad, right?
You're my son.
You whack that spider.
I can't whack the spider, Dad.
Come on.
Whack it.
You can do it.
Whack the spider.
- I don't want to whack it.
- Yes, you can.
Come on.
Kill the spider.
Kill the spider.
Dad, I can't crush it.
I can't whack it!
Hey.
There.
Happy?
No, I'm not happy, Megan.
I was trying to make a point about how it's important to whack your own spiders!
Whatever.
Mm-hmm.
Past the Old Miller Road.
Okay.
Great.
It is an old home, Ms. Evers.
And my employer is anxious to move on.
Would it be possible for you to come alone to discuss the situation?
But my husband and I work as a team.
The master usually does not take visitors.
However, from your photograph, he thought you to have a trustworthy face.
About your husband, he felt differently.
Oh.
You got our flyer.
The master had wished to meet you tomorrow evening.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
But tomorrow I've got plans that can't be broken.
Who is that?
- Excuse me a second.
- Who is that?
Just someone calling about repping a house.
What's the address?
Where is it?
Sara, do you know where this place is?
The places up here are big multimillion-dollar mansions.
This could be big.
And what about our big family adventure?
It's just a little detour.
How long is it gonna take?
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.
You kids should be excited.
You're gonna see Mommy and Daddy in real-estate action.
Somebody's calling me.
Who's calling me?
Hello.
Jim Evers, Evers Evers Real Estate.
Stan, how you doing?
What's the latest?
Really?
The Selmer property?
Tomorrow?
Wow.
I'm kind of out of town right now.
Hey.
But, hey, listen.
Maybe I could come back early.
Oh, no.
I can't come back early.
No, I can't come back early.
Maybe we should just take care of this on Monday.
All right?
Monday?
Monday sounds fantastic.
Okay.
I'll talk to you on Monday.
We're gonna talk on Monday.
Are we still in America?
Here it is, right here.
Okay?
All right?
Yeah, that's a whole lot of gate.
They must have a big possum problem down here.
That's some big possum.
Didn't they know we were coming?
Of course they knew.
Maybe there's a call box or something.
Hello?
!
Hello!
The Evers are here!
Yes, we're here now!
Nobody's answering.
Now I got to get out in the dirt with my brand-new shoes on.
Wow.
How are we gonna get in?
What if you give me a boost, and I'll go around the back?
They're probably old.
We'll surprise them.
You'll probably kill them.
Let's just go.
It's getting late.
You know, Sara, you give up too easy.
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.
All right.
We're in business.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's do this.
Wow.
Bob Vila would have a field day with this place.
Hey, Megan, don't slam the door like that.
It's very sensitive.
It's a car, Dad.
Ah!
It's not just a car.
It's a very delicate piece of machinery.
Shh.
She didn't mean what she just said.
She didn't mean that.
Come on.
Let's see what's around back.
I'm getting hungry.
Me too.
Don't worry.
We'll be 20 minutes tops.
Hey, Dad, when we get to the lake, can I go to that pizza shop where I ate that whole pizza, and when we got to the cabin,
I threw up and you still saw the pepperoni chunks in it?
Yeah, we can go there if we can avoid a repeat performance.
Wow.
Now, that's something you don't see every day.
Oh, my God.
Dead people?
Hey, honey.
You know they have, uh, dead people in the backyard?
Well, some people have pools.
Some people have private cemeteries.
It happens.
You're gonna sell a house with this?
This historical sprawling manor with spacious grounds?
Yes.
Hey, that's good.
We'll put that on the listing.
And leave out all the dead people?
We'll just stick to the bright side.
Oh, no.
I got my good suit on.
Oh.
You think it's gonna stop?
Oh, I hope it's not raining at the lake.
When you're at work with Mommy and Daddy, you're always on your best behavior, right?
Okay.
Whoo!
Look at the size of these knockers.
Ever see anything like that before?
Hello?
!
Evers Real Estate!
Evers Real Estate!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
We're the Evers from Evers Evers Real Estate.
Hi!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Never.
Sara, this puts us in a whole new league.
Smells like Grandma's house.
Worse.
Smells like Grandma.
This place is just a little dusty.
We'll get a cleaning crew to come out here and shine it up.
This place would be sparkling from top to bottom.
Mom, this place has spiders.
Sara Evers.
Yes, I'm Sara.
My name is Ramsley.
Hello, Ramsley.
I'm Jim Evers of Evers Evers Real Estate at your service.
We were not expecting... others.
Yes, we were on our way out of town.
Yeah, then when we realized the enormity and complexity of your unique estate, we wanted to commit the full resources of Evers Evers Real Estate.
At Evers Evers, we want you to be happy forevers and evers.
Please accept this waterproof calendar as a token of our appreciation.
Very well.
We shall have to place other settings.
Who do you have the settings for?
Master Gracey wishes to discuss his affairs over dinner.
Oh, I'm afraid we have plans.
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.
Oh, yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darling.
What about our family adventure?
Yeah, Dad.
We'll just have some soup, and then we'll get going, okay?
All right?
Wow.
Wow.
Nice.
Very nice.
Good job.
Good job.
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to eat like this every day at home?
The master will be with you shortly.
Carry on.
I said, "Carry on. " He walks off.
Have you ever seen a fireplace this amazing?
Incredible.
Ah, we could have one heck of a wienie roast in that thing, huh?
Seriously.
Look at this detail.
I've never seen anything like this.
- Haven't you?
My grandfather spared no expense when he built this mansion.
Well, your grandfather had really good taste in tchotchkes.
I'm Jim Evers of Evers Evers Real Estate.
Charmed to make your acquaintance, sir.
Edward.
Edward Gracey.
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.
You want to come meet Mr. Gracey?
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Gracey.
And this is our daughter, Megan, and our son, Michael.
You have very beautiful children, Ms. Evers.
I kicked in some chromosomes, too.
Children.
Madam.
Oh.
Nice.
Okay.
Thank you.
The master was very pleased when he heard you could come on such short notice.
Normally we would not have called you here so abruptly.
But we had no other choice.
What do you got, termites or something?
Big house like this must have a lot of termites.
No.
But lately there have been more... disturbances.
What do you think of the house, Ms. Evers?
Oh.
I think it's absolutely incredible.
The Italian influence.
The Renaissance style of the molding.
The attention to detail is stunning.
You never see houses like this.
Or at least I don't.
Great care and love went into the building of this mansion.
This house is my inheritance.
My birthright.
But lately it's become too much to bear.
Tell me, Mr. Evers.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts?
Yeah.
Sure.
I believe in ghosts.
Yeah.
I don't think it's a good idea to put that on the listing.
You should talk about how many bathrooms are in the house.
People love bathrooms.
We should play up the toilet angle and leave out ghosts.
I think that'd be best.
The storm has swollen the river.
How's that?
The storm has flooded the road.
I'm afraid there will be no leaving the mansion tonight.
What?
Of course you are all more than welcome to spend the night here.
Oh, no.
I really don't think we should.
We've got plans.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
Ramsley will show you to your rooms.
I believe the children will be comfortable in this room.
Yeah.
Real homey.
You'll be fine.
Wow.
Hey, listen.
When you flush the toilet, check and see how quickly it refills.
Good night, Dad.
Good night.
I hope you and the madame will find this room to your liking.
Yeah.
It's great.
It'll be like spending the night in a fine hotel.
Will there be anything else that you require, sir?
Are you gonna get us some chocolates?
Pardon?
You know, the little chocolates they put on the hotel pillows.
Sometimes they have chocolates on the pillow.
They have little chocolates on the pillows... to have.
What's the problem?
In the first place, we weren't even supposed to be here.
We were supposed to be at the lake.
What am I supposed to do, control the weather now, Sara?
That's not the point.
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.
Excuse me.
This is a big opportunity for all of us.
Not for us, for you.
The only thing you seem to care about anymore is work.
Oh, but when I'm working hard, it doesn't matter as long as I'm bringing you home expensive gifts, right?
Hey, what are you...
Hey, Sara.
Hey, Sara, I didn't mean to say that, okay?
Sara.
Come on.
Stop it.
Sara.
Sara.
I'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?
Aah!
Ooh.
You scared me.
- Pardon the intrusion, sir.
- Yes.
The master was wondering if he might have a word with you in the library.
A word?
Okay.
I'd love to have a word with him.
Sure.
Let's go talk some turkey.
Yes.
Turkey.
- Very good, sir.
- Yeah.
If you will kindly follow me.
Yeah.
Of course.
Of course.
Hey, Sara, I'm gonna have a word with Mr. Gracey.
I'll be back in a minute.
Ramsley, I was just wondering.
Have you ever been to a tanning salon?
I've got a friend who's got a really great place.
You can get a really smooth tan.
Do something about that ashy white look.
I'm sure the ladies would love it.
Yes.
Sounds wonderful.
Would you care for a drink, sir, while you're waiting?
Yeah.
Don't mind if I do.
Thank you, Ramsley.
Oh, wow!
Now, that's class.
That's what I need to do.
Get a big picture of myself to put on the living room wall.
Adds a touch of elegance to the room.
Yes, sir.
Very elegant.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Ramsley.
Mmm.
So, Ramsley, how long you been a butler?
A long time.
What are the most important qualifications in case I might be doing some interviewing?
Attending to every detail.
Understanding priorities.
And above all, knowing one's place.
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?
You know, what floats his boat?
The master likes a great many things.
Art, literature, beauty.
And all that stuff about ghosts.
Did he get, like, a bad clam in his jambalaya one night?
You don't believe in ghosts, sir?
Absolutely not.
Let me tell you something.
The way I see it, you only go around the track once.
So you do it full-out all the way around.
Mr. Evers, may I confide in you?
Please do.
The master is not well.
He must leave this house, Mr. Evers.
He must move on.
It is of the gravest importance, I assure you.
Or I fear the very worst.
I can't believe this.
Still no reception.
We had to take that little detour.
20 minutes tops.
Yeah, right.
Do you think it's gonna stop raining soon?
How should I know?
I'm not the weatherman.
Hmm.
Stogies.
Not bad.
Not at all.
Hold onto that.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Wonderful.
Must be nice.
Must be really nice.
I tell ya.
Ahh.
Hmm.
Hello there, good man.
Ramsley, fix the gentleman a drink.
Nigel, I just recently returned from the Continent, where I found the most interesting book.
Yes, it was called "Raising the Dead. "
Oh!
Oh, cripes.
Oh.
I hope that doesn't stain.
Oh.
Wow.
Interesting.
Wow.
Wow.
I wonder where this leads to.
Hey!
Hey, open this back up!
Hey, open up!
Ramsley!
Ramsley!
Push back the head!
Hey, will somebody push the head back?
Megan!
What do you think it is?
It's a ghost ball.
I think it wants us to follow it.
I think you're crazy.
It does.
It wants us to follow it.
Hey, Megan, wait up!
Where's that scary albino when you need him?
Oh.
Hello.
Have you seen my husband?
Excuse me.
Wait!
Wait!
Oh, Ramsley.
It's you.
May I help you?
Yes.
I was just looking for my husband.
Ah, indeed.
I left him in the library.
Right through there.
Honey, it's late.
Let's not fight anymore.
Come to bed?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were my husband.
Can I help you with that?
Ramsley hates it when I leave things lying about.
Yes.
He seems a bit proper.
He strikes most people that way.
Once you get to know him, you'll find that's not the case.
But he's really...
He's really very sweet.
Thank you.
He's been like a father to me.
Mr. Gracey, may I ask you something?
Yes.
Of course.
Anything.
This house.
It's been in your family for generations.
It's your home.
Why do you want to sell it?
These walls are filled with so many memories.
Some of them painful.
I think for you to understand, I really must show you.
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Although it might be a bit worn and faded from its original grandeur, this house was once filled with so many things.
So much life.
With grand parties, dancing, laughter, and, above all, hope.
Being a Gracey meant that you were denied nothing.
The world was yours.
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?
She did.
Who?
Elizabeth.
Hers is the story that haunts these walls.
Come on.
Megan, wait.
You don't know the last time that thing's been inspected.
Would you just relax?
Where's your sense of adventure?
This is against all my better judgment.
Hi!
Is anyone home?
Those must be termites.
Some big-ass termites.
That's all.
Hello?
- Oh!
Oh.
Aah!
Aah!
Megan!
Mom.
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!
This is unspeakable!
Unspeakable!
You have to leave!
- Who is that?
- That's none of your business.
Now, come on.
Get out of here.
It's way past your bedtime.
Her name was Elizabeth.
Are you kids hungry?
Does anybody want a cookie?
Cookies?
!
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!
Trespassers don't get cookies!
This is none of their concern.
It is their concern!
They're involved!
Hide!
Hide!
The children are not in their room.
Have you seen them?
Children?
What children?
What children?
Her children.
The children she wasn't supposed to bring.
Along with that brainless husband of hers.
Thank you.
If I had to listen to another word from that insufferable fool, I think I would have burst.
Of course, sir.
What a fool!
Did I not tell her to come alone?
Is it really too much to ask for a little cooperation?
A little order?
Of course not, sir.
If you find the children, bring them to me.
- Certainly, sir.
- Yes, sir.
The final arrangements have been made.
Nothing further will interfere with the master's plan.
Thank God I heard your voice.
I lost my way.
I don't know how to get out of here.
I'm sorry if I sound a little frazzled.
I just had myself a little freak show back there.
It's time to respond.
I was supposed to meet with Mr. Gracey.
But I got stuck in the wall.
Goblins and ghoulies from last Halloween, awaken the spirits with your tambourine.
Okay, I hear you, but I don't see you.
Where are you?
I am Madame Leota, seer of all, voice to the spirits.
Whom do you seek?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, let me out of here!
Silence!
Whom do you seek?
I am seeking a way out of here.
Then you must look within.
I don't want to look within.
I want to look without.
There is great evil in this house.
A devil's curse.
It seeks to destroy you.
Why would something seek to destroy me?
I'm just here to sell the house.
Dark spirits from the grave, come forth.
Lift us from the black and show us.
Show us the way back.
Dark spirits?
Hey, no dark spirits.
Don't you make no dark spirits come out.
Lift us.
Lift us up to the light.
And lead us through this stormy night.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!
Hey, I'd really like to stay on the ground.
I'd rather stay on the ground.
Can I stay on the ground?
Evil and darkness have fallen this night.
But now to survive, you must gain new sight.
I must first gain new underwear.
Only the light will lead the way.
Follow it and find your way home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Go, Mr. Evers.
Your family is at stake.
Your very life is at stake.
Break the curse.
There is no escape for you unless you lift this spell.
Go.
Save yourself.
Save your family.
Release her.
Release us all!
I'm getting so queasy.
I'm getting very queasy.
Oh!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
- Dad!
- Dad!
Hey!
Michael and Megan, you okay?
We're fine, thanks.
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.
We have a problem.
Because of the rain?
We're gonna get a little wet.
Let's just find your mom and get out of here.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She can't leave.
And why not?
Because she can't!
If I could tell you, I would.
But I can't, so I won't, okay?
Hey, how'd you...
Hey, look.
Come on.
Daddy's having more hallucinations.
Let's go.
- They're ghosts, Dad.
- They're not ghosts.
We're just having hallucinations from that dinner we ate.
It was that chicken.
It didn't taste right.
- Oh!
- It's not the chicken!
All right.
It's not the chicken.
But we're getting out of here.
But we have to help them.
You can't help the dead, honey.
They're beyond help.
The man's talking sense.
Everyone should keep their noses in their own business.
But we have to help them break the curse.
Why is everybody talking about a curse?
Have you been talking to that crazy green gypsy in the giant paperweight?
We've got to go back to see her.
- No back.
I'm not going back.
- But, Dad!
They had me floating all around the room.
Hey, I was strapped to a chair, floating around the room with a marching band chasing me.
I'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!
But Mom's in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
She died here in this house.
She was so very young.
So very beautiful.
She was in love with the heir to this mansion.
Your grandfather.
And he loved her more than life itself.
But they were from different worlds and couldn't be together.
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?
She took her own life.
Poison.
After that, his life became unbearable.
And so, without hope, without love, without Elizabeth, he hung himself.
His soul wanders these halls, waiting for her to return.
If you listen carefully, you can still hear the beating of his broken heart.
Wait a minute.
Hold it a second.
You're telling me this guy is dead and the reason we were brought here is he wants to try to get jiggy with my wife?
Pretty much.
Are you upset?
The guy is dead, and he's trying to get with my wife!
And the house isn't really for sale!
Yes, I'm upset!
Oh, Madame Leota, is it her?
Is she truly our dear, departed Elizabeth come back to us?
It is true.
She walks these halls.
You see?
I told you it is her!
But do not be deceived.
All things are not as they appear.
For the curse to be lifted, the truth must be known.
And for the truth to be known, you must find the key.
What are you talking about, ball lady?
What key?
Enter the tomb under the great dead oak and travel down deep under the ground.
And there you will find the key that must be found.
Find the black crypt that bears no name, or soon your fate will be the same.
You're telling me all I have to do is find this key, then I'm gonna walk out of here with my wife and kids?
The key is the answer to all.
Well, great.
I'm in.
Let's get this key.
There's only one problem.
How do we get out of here?
Yeah, how do we get out of here?
Well, there's always, uh, my way.
Hey!
I thought you said you could drive this thing!
Don't you worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Well, you better just keep your eyes on the road!
- Move over!
- What are you doing?
If you keep driving, you'll kill us all!
That's where you're wrong.
Because some of us are already dead!
Dad, look.
Ready?
Fire!
Dad?
Yes, son?
I see dead people.
Excuse me.
Why are all these ghosts still hanging around here?
When they died, they couldn't find the light.
And now...
Now they're trapped.
Doomed to wander the Earth for all eternity.
Nice.
Nice job.
Whoa!
Okay.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Can they see us?
No.
Of course not.
Yes, I can.
I'm looking at you right now in your stupid hat.
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.
Whatever.
Come on, kids.
Let's go.
Come on.
I could swear he was looking right at me.
He's psychic.
This was to have been her wedding dress.
Oh, it's lovely.
It would have been lovelier if she'd had a chance to wear it.
Now it serves only as a dark reminder of what could have been.
To love someone so much and then lose them so suddenly.
I can't imagine how awful that must be.
If you truly love someone, they never leave you.
They remain in your heart forever.
Isn't that romantic?
He was willing to throw everything away for love.
Well, now he's broke, dead, and cursed.
Nice move.
- Oh, crap!
These are my new shoes.
Hey, kids, watch your step.
- Oh, crap!
Hey, Michael, don't say "crap. "
All right.
Where is this place?
Okay, where are we?
I think the gypsy lady said something about making a left at an oak.
Okay.
Well, glad she was so specific.
What is that?
Do you hear that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
# And harmonize #
# When we ghosts come out to socialize #
# Doom, doom, doom, doom #
# When the cryptos creak and the tombstones quake #
# Spooks come out for a swinging wake #
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.
But we were wondering if you happen to know where the mausoleum was.
# Down by the #
# Old mill stream #
# Where I first met you #
No, no.
I think they said it was an old oak.
That's what they said.
It's by the...
# By the light #
# By the light, by the light #
# Of the silvery moon #
Yeah.
You sound really good.
Your harmony's tight.
But we're trying to find my wife.
She'll be...
# Comin' 'round the mountain when she comes #
# She'll be comin' 'round the mountain... #
Listen, guys.
I'm trying to find a key.
I'm trying to find a key...
# Where's the key?
Where's the key?
#
# Where's the beautiful key?
#
# Find the key, find the key #
# Oh, how happy you'll be #
The key that I'm trying to find is in the mausoleum.
The key is in the mausoleum.
# You left your key #
# In a mausoleum #
# Down in Dixie #
Dad, there it is!
- # Dad, there it is #
- Thanks.
- # Dad, there it is #
- Thanks for nothing.
Okay.
We made it.
All right, kids.
Stay close.
Hey.
Look.
It's a warning.
Now, how do you know that?
I studied Latin for three years, Dad.
You thought it was dumb, remember?
You said it was a dead language.
Oh, we see how wrong I was about that.
"Beware all who enter.
Here lies the passage to the dead. "
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?
- I don't like Latin.
- Hey, wait.
Michael.
You're 10 years old now.
You got to start being a man.
I just turned 10.
I'm still getting used to it.
Okay.
Here's what we do.
Megan, stay here with your brother.
What?
I'm not gonna leave him out here by himself.
You guys stay together.
I'll go in here, and I'll take care of this.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh.
Wow.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
20 minutes tops, right?
20 minutes tops.
What was it that gypsy told me to look for?
Look for a crypt with...
Look for a crypt...
- A crypt without a name.
- Aah!
Oh!
What's the matter with you?
You can't just be popping out like that.
I thought I told you to wait with Michael.
I was worried you wouldn't find it.
Besides, Michael's fine.
She said, "Find the black crypt with no name, or soon your fate will be the same. "
That must be it.
Good hunch, Dad.
I'm officially starting to get sick of this place.
And we're here 'cause of who?
Because I take seriously my responsibility as breadwinner.
I want you guys to have everything I never had before.
I didn't know you had a bad childhood.
I didn't have a bad childhood.
Then why do we have to have what you didn't have?
Because...
Hey, don't be tricking me, you little Latin-speaking 13-year-old.
Let's just get this over with.
Hold this.
Hold it with two hands, now.
Aah!
Phew!
Oh, man.
Excuse me one second.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Oh!
Aah.
Ugh.
Oh, no.
Ew.
Aah.
Okay.
All right.
Now, that wasn't hard, was it?
Let's get out of here.
That gypsy had me thinking it was gonna be hard.
- That was easy.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no.
Oh!
Oh, no!
Go get the key!
I'll take care of him!
Hey, man, go on back to bed.
Get back in your bed.
Go back to bed.
I'm Jim Evers of Evers Evers Real Estate.
Hey, look, I don't want no trouble, man.
The gypsy told me it was all right to get the key, so -
Oh!
Just lighten up.
Now, let me tell you something.
I got to get my wife.
I don't want no trouble.
Seriously, back up!
You asked for it.
Next time you're gonna think twice before coming back from the dead, ain't you?
- Did you get the key?
- I'm looking!
I'm looking!
Take your time.
Relax.
I have everything under control.
I have everything completely under control.
Megan, you better look faster!
Oh, I don't want to do this.
Jeez.
Aah!
- Aah!
Give me your hand.
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!
Hold on!
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!
Michael!
Michael, open the door.
Michael, it's locked from the outside!
Michael, open the door.
Open the door.
Michael!
Dad, there's spiders everywhere, and I don't have a magazine.
- Hey, Michael, are you scared?
- Uh-huh.
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.
- Daddy's scared right now.
- You are?
Yes, I'm very scared.
Now, please open the door, son!
Michael, open the door, or I'll kill you!
That's great.
Keep him calm.
Hey, Michael, listen, it's okay to get scared.
Everybody gets scared now and then.
You just can't let it stop you.
Michael, if you think you're scared now, wait till the zombies come out!
What zombies?
Michael!
Hey, Michael, look.
Just open the door.
Please, man.
Open the door right now.
Dad, they're coming!
Michael, open the door right now!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door right now!
Open the door!
Oh!
Aah!
Lock it!
Lock it!
Okay.
Come on!
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Get 'em off!
Okay.
Come on.
Get 'em off.
Okay.
All right.
We got it.
All right.
You okay?
Okay.
My brave little man.
All right.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah.
You got the key?
Oh, no.
Wait.
Whoa.
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
There it is.
Okay.
All right.
Now, we went to hell and back to get this thing.
Where's the door out of here?
First, you must find the trunk.
Trunk?
Yes, trunk.
Not door?
No.
Not door.
Trunk.
All you said I had to do was find this key!
I got the key.
Now you're telling me this story about a trunk!
The key is the answer to all, remember?
Look, I don't make the rules.
I just work here.
Okay.
That's it.
That's the last straw.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Put me down!
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck!
I'll show you bad luck.
I'm tired of playing around.
I'm getting nauseous!
You'll get over it.
Please don't drop me.
I'm fragile.
I'm very fragile.
Don't talk to me about being fragile.
I'm the one that's feeling fragile right now.
Is that it?
- That's it.
- Hmm.
All right.
Now we're in business.
Hey, hold her for a second.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
How do I know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.
Find the thing that must be read lest your heart be filled with dread.
There's nothing in here red.
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here.
It's a letter.
"Yes, my dear heart, I will marry you.
I will love you for all eternity.
And tonight at last, we will be together.
I do.
Forever yours, Elizabeth. "
She didn't kill herself.
She wanted to be with him.
Yeah, and somebody gave him the wrong letter.
Yes.
Well done, Mr. Evers.
I must say I'm impressed.
You are more persistent than I would have ever imagined.
The butler did it?
You got to be kidding me.
I will deal with you two later.
Why'd you kill her?
Because the master would not listen to reason.
He had everything in the world.
And yet he was willing to throw it all away for love.
I did tell him it would end badly.
You're a real cold dude.
No, Mr. Evers.
I am a rational man.
It was my responsibility to the house.
My duty, sir, to see to it that the boy did not make a foolish error in judgment.
Running away with that girl would have destroyed this house.
It would have destroyed everything.
And I could not stand by and watch it all fall to ruin.
Punch his face in, Dad.
Yeah, but first I'm gonna tell his master what really happened.
The master must never know.
Edward and his love will be reunited, and this curse will be broken.
That's not her.
That's my wife.
And what she sees in you I'll never know.
But that is of little importance now.
The only thing that matters is that the master's pain must end.
And it will end tonight.
The curse will be broken, and we can all finally move on.
All right.
That's it, man.
Where's my wife?
Getting ready for her wedding, of course.
What wedding?
He can't marry her.
He's dead, and she's not.
True.
But that can be easily corrected.
Life, I'm afraid, is such a delicate state.
If you put one finger on my wife, I swear I'll kill you.
How wonderful.
You're going to kill a ghost.
- Leave him alone!
- Stop it!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Let them go!
You're gonna let my kids out of here, take me to my wife, and let us out of here right now!
You want out, fine.
Let me show you out.
Now, for the last time, good night, Mr. Evers.
Aah!
Ugh!
Oh!
This house has waited so long to have its shroud of darkness lifted.
And tonight, for the first time in, oh, so many years,
I believe it may be possible that the story will finally end differently.
Sara?
Do you believe that love is about second chances?
About forgiveness?
Yes, I do.
Don't you remember?
Remember?
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?
Don't you recognize me at all?
Mr. Gracey.
I thought certainly bringing you back to Gracey Manor would help you remember.
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.
Where it happened.
Where we spent our last moments together.
Where we danced together for the last time before you...
Before you killed yourself!
But now you've returned to me.
And at long last, we can be together.
Why do you not remember?
You were my world, my life!
And I have loved you in death as I did in life!
Let me go!
Why do you not remember?
You are her.
You are Elizabeth.
You must be!
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart.
I am your one true love.
And now we can finally be together.
Don't you understand?
Elizabeth, you must listen to me.
I'm not Elizabeth!
Please!
I implore you.
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!
She doesn't remember.
It can't be her.
It is her, sir.
The gypsy woman prophesied her return.
And now the time has come.
You had best get ready.
But she doesn't remember.
In time she will, sir.
I assure you she will.
Open up!
Hey!
Let me in!
Aah!
Oh, Ramsley, you have to help me.
There's something horribly wrong.
Mr. Gracey...
Yes.
I know, my dear.
I know.
He's expecting you.
He's always been expecting you.
And you haven't put on your dress yet.
We can't keep the master waiting.
Waiting?
For what?
Why, your wedding, of course.
My...
I'm not Elizabeth!
Of course you are, my dear.
You may not see it yet.
But in time you will.
You don't actually think I'm going through with this madness?
Oh, yes.
I very much do.
You see... we wouldn't want anything to happen to the children.
Now, would we?
Michael!
Megan!
You wouldn't.
Of course not, my dear.
But that is entirely up to you.
If not, I really do fear for the children.
Have her ready.
And this time, any further acts of insubordination will be dealt with in the harshest possible manner.
But, sir?
There are worse things than purgatory, madam.
I can assure you.
Have her ready.
Tears of joy.
What are you doing?
Hey, you leave me alone.
Just get out of here and leave me alone.
Oh, I see.
You're just gonna sit there, feeling sorry for yourself.
You tell me why not.
This whole thing was my fault.
We should've never been here in the first place.
Supposed to be at the lake.
We'd be sitting by a warm fire right now.
And I made us come here.
And now it's too late.
No.
It's never too late.
Hey, look, I tried to get in there, and I can't, all right?
I tried!
I failed!
You try.
You fail.
But the only true failure is when you stop trying.
What do you want me to do?
Huh?
Try again.
Hold on!
With what?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Elizabeth?
Yes, my love.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
I'll wait here.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
Dad!
Help us!
Michael!
Megan!
Wilt thou, Edward Gracey, have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony?
I will.
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw, take this man to be your lawful husband, to love and cherish in death as you did in life?
I do.
Whoa!
Aah!
From this day forward, you shall be joined together as one for all eternity until the very end of time.
What God has joined together let no man cast asunder.
- Dad!
- Dad!
If anyone has any objections...
Yeah, I got a few objections!
The next time I say we're going to the lake,
- we're going to the lake.
- Let's go.
Get away from her.
I lost her once.
I don't intend to let it happen again.
This is not Elizabeth.
Ramsley, you tell him the truth.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Now you got amnesia, huh?
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.
He's been lying to you all along.
I'm warning you, sir.
Step away.
Don't think 'cause you pull out your sword
I'm gonna let you marry my wife.
My patience is wearing thin.
Elizabeth, please, come along.
I'm not Elizabeth.
You must be.
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.
Ramsley wants you to think she's Elizabeth so this curse would be lifted.
That is absurd.
Forgive me.
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.
But on the other side,
I'm gonna be whipping your ass for all eternity.
So maybe you should read this before you stab somebody.
- What is it?
- It's Elizabeth's letter.
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.
The one he stole.
You never saw it.
What's the meaning of this?
Must we continue to listen to the ramblings of a lunatic?
But it is written in her hand.
Yeah, it's written in her hand.
Explain that, Ramsley.
Well?
Your union was unacceptable.
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen.
So you killed her.
I told you it would be a mistake to run away with that girl.
But I loved her!
Was love my mistake?
Yes!
I tried to protect you.
All these years I've sacrificed for you.
But what would you understand of sacrifice, duty, or honor?
You loved her.
Well, damn you.
Damn you all to hell!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Jim!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
- Mom!
- Mom!
Mom, what's wrong?
Are you all right?
- Mom.
- Hey!
Hey, Sara.
Sara, what's the matter?
Sara, what's wrong?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong?
It's the poison!
Oh, no.
No.
Hey, Sara.
Come on.
Please.
Don't do this!
Sara, don't do this.
Please.
Jim...
Sara!
Hey!
Sara.
Sara, come on.
Please.
Sara.
Sara, I love you.
Sara, please.
I love you so much.
Hey, get away from us!
Leave us alone!
No, Dad.
It won't hurt us.
Elizabeth, is that you?
Yes, my love.
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.
The truth had to be known for me to be released.
He saved me.
It was nothing.
Oh, Elizabeth.
Yes, my darling?
I have waited so long for this moment.
And now only heaven awaits.
He's not really kissing your mom.
Hey.
That's my wife.
Sara?
Jim?
I thought I lost you.
Oh.
I thought I lost you, too.
I'm back, Sara.
I'm back.
Can you ever forgive me?
Oh, what's to forgive?
You loved her.
Here.
Take this.
What is it?
The deed to the house.
It's yours.
Do with it what you will.
Sell it, keep it.
Do whatever makes you and your family happy.
And thank you.
Thank you all so much.
Wait!
Wait for us!
Hold on!
What's all this?
Well, I don't know what we'll need.
What are you talking about?
We're going to heaven.
You can't take it with you.
The hell I can't.
- Oh.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you all so much.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- So long, now.
Okay, little man.
All right.
Hurry!
Let's go!
- Bye!
- Bye!
Okay.
Here we go.
Whoo!
Bye-bye.
Angels in heaven together at last.
The tale is well ended for those who have passed.
Love endures all, no reason, no rhyme.
It lasts forever and forever all time.
Mom, Leota won't shut up.
- Are we there yet?
- I'm getting pretty hungry.
Can we get some pizza?
How long before we get there, Sara?
20 minutes tops.
Nothing takes 20 minutes.

Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom
Tony the Tiger style.
- Naked with a kerchief?
- What?
Naked with a kerchief.
No, what do you call top, no pants?
Oh, that's like a Winnie the Pooh or a Paddington.
- Honey the Smacks Frog.
- There's a Donald the Duck.
- I guess pretty much any kind of bear except for Yogi 'cause that's naked with a tie.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.
I saw his entire butt.
Look, Dirk's a good guy.
He was my roommate when I was in law school.
- Smartest guy I know.
- So, he's a lawyer?
No, he's not a lawyer, but he does have a law degree, a business degree, and a master's in agriculture.
He's kind of like a degree collector.
He's got his PhD in poetry, so...
That sucks for poems.
How'd it go with Fancyman?
It was an amazing first date, except for one awkward part at the end.
I don't go on dates very often.
Guys my age always want to skip the date and just go right for the gold.
Which I don't give them because I'm stingy with my gold.
Unless they dig for it.
I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.
Oh, hi.
Black sedan?
Uh, yeah.
What?
So, he patted me on the back.
I thought I'd at least get a front pat.
Whoo-ha!
What?
Look, he probably just got nervous.
No, Russell's never nervous.
That's the worst answer.
Winston, what do you think?
Oh, thank God.
Hey, what's up, baby?
- Ooh.
- Hey, is that Shelby?
What was that?
That was a cat sound.
Oh, because you did the whip, we should've...
- Guys!
- It should have been the other way around.
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.
But next time you guys want advice about girls, don't come crawling to me.
- You got it.
- That sounds good.
No, that was a joke;
I love it when you guys ask me stuff.
It makes me feel really important.
- And I love it...
- "One shade the more,"
"One ray the less,"
"Had half impaired the nameless grace."
Are you wearing a ladies' scarf?
Come to my lecture tomorrow night.
Absolutely not.
She's missing out, my man.
- Hey, Schmidt?
- Yeah?
Mind if I borrow your car to take Shelby to the airport?
Oh, I don't have a car, Winston.
Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the, uh,
"man-bulance"?
The man-bulance is resting.
He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.
That's cool.
I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle all of Shelby's luggage anyway.
Ooh...
What the hell is wrong with you, Winston?
The man-bulance could fit the luggage of nine Shelbys.
It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.
You know what?
Here you go, Winston.
There you go.
- Enjoy luxury.
- All good, man.
I got your second set, so thank you.
How'd you get my second set of keys?
Hey, someone left your door open.
Someone left your face beautiful.
Who is that?
Apparently, his name is Dirk.
Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.
But should that stop you from seeing this?
Yeah!
That's awesome.
Does he keep you happy?
He does what he's told.
So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?
Oh, you're a sex-cretary?
I am definitely the boss.
Sex-cretary, he just made that up.
I hate bachelorette parties.
I have, like 50 different penis items in my carry-on.
This plane goes down, there's gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff.
Sharks?
I thought you were going to Vegas?
No, I'm going to Mexico.
I thought I told you that.
Hmm-mm.
Well, if you don't want me to go,
I don't have to go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I want you to go.
It'll be good, you know?
We spent the last five nights together.
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.
Right.
- Did I say something wrong?
- What?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you across all the space.
Hey.
Great news, um, Jess is taking a shower.
Okay, I just need, like, a good, solid ten minutes.
Eat this granola bar first.
I want to try something called the horse trough.
No, Cece.
I'm not having sex with you right now.
I have to get everybody in the company's name into a version of "We Didn't Start the Fire."
Totally fine.
What do you need, like, 20 minutes?
Cece, this...
Okay, this is real work for my real boss who is not you.
Oh, I get what's happening here.
It's 'cause Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist."
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.
So, first of all, thank you for the demotion.
And second of all, I quit.
So, I'll see you tonight.
Did you not hear anything I just said?
Oh, no, I totally heard you loud and clear, but do you know who didn't happen to hear you?
What are you doing?
Don't-don't-don't involve them.
Oh, my...
They just didn't hear.
Don't bring them into this.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Hi.
I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar,
I love...
I love you both.
All the zany adventures we've had.
But we can't go to White Castle today.
Just can't do it.
You're serious about this?
Cece?
Is Schmidt bothering you?
This is not over.
Okay?
Was it like a caress or like a...
like a pat?
No, like a pat;
It was distinctly a pat, and it was actually kind of hot.
The man knows how to pat a back.
At any point during the night, did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
Maybe.
Once or twice.
No, stop, it freaks me out and you know.
Well, what do I do?
I really, really want to see him again, like, badly.
- You just call him.
- I can't.
He's too sophisticated.
He told me he'd run with the bulls, and I quote,
"not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."
Big deal.
Just call him.
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power unless she's sexting, in which case, she gains a half power.
Okay, well, that's Schmidt just talking...
I mean, what does Schmidt know?
Look, all the guys that you live with-- boys.
You've only dated boys.
Russell is a grown man, and I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.
He has a hot air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.
Okay, sweetheart, you are sophisticated.
You've just got to pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.
You know what?
You're right:
I am sophisticated.
I'm gonna do this.
What is that?
It's a phone.
Oh, God.
And thus ends our journey through the words of time.
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan, from Dylan to Dylan.
They're both named Dylan.
- Watch him bring it home, man.
- Do I have to?
We have to rage.
"Rage against the dying of the light.
"And when the light is no longer bright."
"Don't think twice, it's all right."
It's over.
Smartest guy I know.
Professor?
- Professor?
- Yeah?
We wanted to remind you about the post-lecture wine and cheese event.
A soiree, eh?
Super classy.
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.
Yeah, I-I e-mailed you about that.
That was me.
- Oh, sometimes when I get a really long e-mail...
I don't read it.
Bye.
Oh, Mommy.
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?
You guys having problems or something?
No, no, no, everything's fine.
She left me and moved out of the house.
I guess it was "too hard to support me."
"Financially."
It's all fine; her leaving has allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.
Scarves?
Undergraduate ladies.
You see, girls our age, what do they want?
They want us to wed them, sire their children.
They want you to have
- a-a bedframe.
- Right, yeah.
Hmm?
They want you to eat off plates, but girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?
Have you hung out with a 20-year-old dude lately?
Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low.
- Right.
They haven't even gone through their gay phase yet.
- Hey, man, I'm gonna give Shelby a call really quick.
Just want to check on her, see if everything's all right.
- Sounds good, man.
- What, dude, relax, okay?
I just said we're gonna give each other space, doesn't mean I can't call her, right, to see if anything funny happened on the plane.
You know what "space" means, right?
That's space to have sex with other people.
No, space means you go to Mexico, and you do not have sex with other people.
Watch this.
Nick, don't give my any space.
You got it, my man.
See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now, doesn't it?
Now, Nick, I want you
- to give me some space.
- You got it.
All this space allows me opportunity to have as much sex as we want.
Smartest guy I know.
See how much sex
- we could be having?
- That-that does...
Get out of my way, bookworms!
You ready to make love to some college chicks?
Hey, when's the last time you had mono?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, you're gonna say yesterday.
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.
What... are you wearing?
I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I found this at the lost and found at the gym.
I'm not really sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.
I've never had to do this.
I've never had to seduce somebody before.
If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my aunt Frieda at Seder.
Come on, okay?
I will do anything, and I'll do it anywhere.
All right?
Even fantasy location... number three?
Okay.
Um, how good are the Beatles?
Beatles are the best.
Were you so upset when they broke up?
I would have been, but I was one.
Well, you're not one any more.
How's your prostate?
- Uh...
- I had my breast exam last week, and, like, they're fine.
It's just boob in there, but we have to be careful.
Our bodies are decaying.
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
Why didn't we kiss the other night?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.
- Oh.
- What?
- Hey, I...
- Is everything okay?
Oh.
- I got to go.
This ought to take care of the dinner.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without, um...
Here, there's cab fare.
- Get home safe.
- Oh.
Baby, look, I don't want space, okay?
I don't want anyone to have space.
I want to be standing right in front of you.
I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.
I want to just be passing air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.
No flights tonight.
Hey, Schmidt, do you mind if I borrow your car again?
"Of course you can, Winston.
You're so great."
Thank you!
Nope.
Hey, my name's Nicholas.
Nick, Nick.
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.
Oh, I do.
Dirk, I feel so old here.
Is calling a girl "Shorty" still cool?
We just got to find your angle with these college girls.
Your hook, your panty-melter.
Usually, my hook is that it's closing time, and I'm there.
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.
If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.
Hey.
- Don't-don't do this.
- Skyler, Miriam,
- come over here for a second.
- Don't humiliate me, Dirk.
How cool is my friend, Nick?
Are you a professor, too?
No, no, no, I'm a bartender.
30 years old,
I don't have health insurance.
You know how to make drinks?
Panty-melter.
Do I know how to make drinks, did you say?
Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?
Yeah, I do that professionally.
You could get me drunk professionally?
Are you a cop?
Sometimes.
Do you have identification on you?
I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.
Five nights a week.
Jess, you made it to the party!
What's going on?
Why is the cast of the Social Network in our apartment?
Dirk is a genius!
20-year-old girls-- they think I'm awesome!
And look at 'em!
They don't know what Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!
Can you believe it?
Where's your Fancyman?
Where is he?
I don't know.
It was horrible.
He left and gave me $100 for a cab!
You know what?
I'm gonna use the remaining 90 to get out of here and start a new life.
It's been nice knowing you.
Hey...!
I'm gonna die alone!
Oh, no!
I am so, so sad right now.
My heart hurts!
You want Nick to make you a bayberry breeze?
- 'Cause he is so smart.
- So smart.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do!
This.
I'm not happy!
30 sucks!
Ah, weird party move.

It's been two hours.
This is officially crazy.
Also, I have to go to the bathroom.
Just pee yourself.
So you'd rather sit in my urine for the rest of the car ride than admit to Winston that we're sleeping together?
Yep, absolutely.
Don't even have to think about it.
I don't want to ruin what we have, okay?
Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions, like, "Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"
And, "Seriously, why?"
You think we have something to ruin?
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.
And I was wearing shoulder pads.
So I obviously must like sleeping with you.
A secre-tarty.
Shut... up.
This is pretty great.
I'm freezing.
- Yeah.
- I'm so cold.
How are you not freezing?

Shelby.
Babe, I don't want space.
Neither do I!
That's why I'm at your apartment.
I got on a plane.
I wanted to see you.
What?
!
Babe, look, I'm in Mexico.
I came to see you.
Are you serious?
I miss you, Shelby.
You're so sexy, girl.
In or out of the wig.
I don't care.
Shelby.
You make me so feel brave, babe, and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you, too.
I'm coming back, baby.
No space!
Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir, just me and my American heart... full of love.
Then how do you explain... this?
I can't... sir.
No one in the entire world can explain that.
I am so tall!
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.
Russell?
Oh.
Hey, Jess.
I'm not Jess.
I'm her cousin...
Sylvia?
Are you doing okay?
I want a donut.
Then let's get you a donut.
Please?
I want to talk to you... alone.
Well, this is a fun group.
Hmm.
Can you drop me off at my dorm?
It's called Hamilton.
I'd like to vomit now.
God!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was bad-ass!
- Hey, uh, kiddo.
- Okay.
- Nick, that's the road.
- What's up?
You want the woods.
I want the woods.
You're smart, Russ.
- Come here.
- Hey, it was nothing.
You're okay, Russ.
Okay, we can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.
She's not like us.
She's one of the good ones.
Time to make the puke, Russell.
So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us that our completely equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that you listen to Wicked while you're alone,
I could use that information against you at any point in time.
By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...
Is that a stop sign?
Well, you'd probably want to slow down...
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a go sign.
I don't think it's a go sign.
Because if somebody like you is sleeping with someone like her, then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!
It's just what I'm thinking.
And I want to talk to you.
I want to have a chance to explain.
That's okay.
I understand.
I just...
I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls 'cause we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because...
I think you're a hotty with a body.
Oh.
Um...
I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989... when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
Oh.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this weekend,
I didn't pack her inhaler.
She was having an asthma attack.
- Is Sarah okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I-I...
I just feel like I should have explained.
And I really wanted to kiss you
- the other night.
- Really?
I wanted to do more than kiss you.
I'd like to do you, at some point.
Like, you know, really, really give it to you good.
Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.
I was nervous.
You were nervous?
Nick was right.
He can be really wise sometimes.
Oh, my God, it's happening!
It's coming!
I think I'm dying!
I feel scared and excited!
What do you think?
What do I think of what?
Do you think now is the right moment?
I think so.
Okay.
Get out of me, you poison!
Wait.
Is that your hand?
No.
That's my hand.
- Oh, my God!
- You're welcome.
Get out of here, Dirk!
You get out of here...
Come here.
Hey!
Oh, no!
Where are you guys?
Hello?
Hey, where are you guys?
Hey, could I have walked out into the mountains?
When does a hill become a mountain?
It just happened.
I'm so cold.
Who is this?
Oh, my God, Dirk is dead!
Dirk is dead!
Greatest guy I knew.
(water splashing)
Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom
Tony the Tiger style.
- Naked with a kerchief?
- What?
Naked with a kerchief.
No, what do you call top, no pants?
- Oh, that's like a Winnie the Pooh or a Paddington.
- Honey the Smacks Frog.
There's a Donald the Duck.
SCHMIDT:
I guess pretty much any kind of bear except for Yogi 'cause that's naked with a tie.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.

He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.

They want you to have
- a-a bedframe.
- Right, yeah.
Hmm?
They want you to eat off plates, but girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?
Have you hung out with a 20-year-old dude lately?
- Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low.
- Right.
- They haven't even gone through their gay phase yet.
- Hey, man, I'm gonna give Shelby a call really quick.
Just want to check on her, see if everything's all right.
- Sounds good, man.
- What, dude, relax, okay?
I just said we're gonna give each other space, doesn't mean I can't call her, right, to see if anything funny happened on the plane.
You know what "space" means, right?
That's space to have sex with other people.
No, space means you go to Mexico, and you do not have sex with other people.
Watch this.
Nick, don't give my any space.
You got it, my man.
See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now, doesn't it?
Now, Nick, I want you
- to give me some space.
- You got it.
All this space allows me opportunity to have as much sex as we want.
Smartest guy I know.
See how much sex
- we could be having?
- That-that does...
Get out of my way, bookworms!
You ready to make love to some college chicks?
Hey, when's the last time you had mono?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, you're gonna say yesterday.
CECE:
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.
(screams)
What... are you wearing?
I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I found this at the lost and found at the gym.
I'm not really sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.
I've never had to do this.
I've never had to seduce somebody before.
If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my aunt Frieda at Seder.
Come on, okay?
I will do anything, and I'll do it anywhere.
All right?
Even fantasy location... number three?
(sighing) Okay.
(mellow jazz playing)
Um, how good are the Beatles?
Beatles are the best.
Were you so upset when they broke up?
I would have been, but I was one.
(chuckles)
Well, you're not one any more.
How's your prostate?
- Uh...
- I had my breast exam last week, and, like, they're fine.
It's just boob in there, but we have to be careful.
Our bodies are decaying.
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
Why didn't we kiss the other night?
(quietly) Sorry.
(phone vibrating)
I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.
- Oh.
- What?
- Hey, I...
- Is everything okay?
Oh.
- I got to go.
- This ought to take care of the dinner.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without, um...
Here, there's cab fare.
- Get home safe.
- Oh.
(beep)
Baby, look, I don't want space, okay?
I don't want anyone to have space.
I want to be standing right in front of you.
I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.
I want to just be passing air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.
(sighs)
No flights tonight.
Hey, Schmidt, do you mind if I borrow your car again?
"Of course you can, Winston.
You're so great."
Thank you!
(club music playing)
Nope.
Hey, my name's Nicholas.
Nick, Nick.
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.
Oh, I do.
Dirk, I feel so old here.
Is calling a girl "Shorty" still cool?
We just got to find your angle with these college girls.
Your hook, your panty-melter.
Usually, my hook is that it's closing time, and I'm there.
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.
If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.
Hey.
- Don't-don't do this.
- Skyler, Miriam,
- come over here for a second.
- Don't humiliate me, Dirk.
How cool is my friend, Nick?
Are you a professor, too?
No, no, no, I'm a bartender.
30 years old,
I don't have health insurance.
You know how to make drinks?
(whispering) Panty-melter.
Do I know how to make drinks, did you say?
Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?
Yeah, I do that professionally.
You could get me drunk professionally?
Are you a cop?
Sometimes.
(both laugh)
Do you have identification on you?
(both laugh)
(hip-hop music playing)
I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.
Five nights a week.
Jess, you made it to the party!
What's going on?
Why is the cast of the Social Network in our apartment?
Dirk is a genius!
20-year-old girls-- they think I'm awesome!
And look at 'em!
They don't know what Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!
Can you believe it?
Where's your Fancyman?
Where is he?
I don't know.
It was horrible.
He left and gave me $100 for a cab!
You know what?
I'm gonna use the remaining 90 to get out of here and start a new life.
It's been nice knowing you.
ALL:
Hey...!
I'm gonna die alone!
Oh, no!
I am so, so sad right now.
My heart hurts!
You want Nick to make you a bayberry breeze?
- 'Cause he is so smart.
- So smart.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do!
This. (laughs)
I'm not happy!
30 sucks!
Ah, weird party move.

(whispering):
It's been two hours.
This is officially crazy.
Also, I have to go to the bathroom.
Just pee yourself.
So you'd rather sit in my urine for the rest of the car ride than admit to Winston that we're sleeping together?
Yep, absolutely.
Don't even have to think about it.
I don't want to ruin what we have, okay?
Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions, like, "Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"
And, "Seriously, why?"
You think we have something to ruin?
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.
And I was wearing shoulder pads.
So I obviously must like sleeping with you.
A secre-tarty.
Shut... up.
This is pretty great.
I'm freezing.
- Yeah.
- I'm so cold.
How are you not freezing?

Shelby.
Babe, I don't want space.
SHELBY:
Neither do I!
That's why I'm at your apartment.
I got on a plane.
I wanted to see you.
What?
!
Babe, look, I'm in Mexico.
I came to see you.
Are you serious?
I miss you, Shelby.
You're so sexy, girl.
In or out of the wig.
I don't care.
Shelby.
You make me so feel brave, babe, and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you, too.
I'm coming back, baby.
No space!
(tires squealing)
Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?
(laughs)
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir, just me and my American heart... full of love.
Then how do you explain... this?
I can't... sir.
(laughs)
No one in the entire world can explain that.
I am so tall!
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.
Russell?
(shrieks and grunts, crowd gasps)
Oh.
(whooping)
Hey, Jess.
I'm not Jess.
I'm her cousin...
Sylvia?
Are you doing okay?
I want a donut.
Then let's get you a donut.
Please?
I want to talk to you... alone.
Well, this is a fun group.
Hmm.
Can you drop me off at my dorm?
It's called Hamilton.
I'd like to vomit now. (grunts)
(grunts)
God!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was bad-ass!
- Hey, uh, kiddo.
- Okay.
- Nick, that's the road.
- What's up?
You want the woods.
I want the woods.
You're smart, Russ.
- Come here.
- Hey, it was nothing.
You're okay, Russ.
Okay, we can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.
She's not like us.
She's one of the good ones.
Time to make the puke, Russell.
SCHMIDT:
So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us that our completely equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that you listen to Wicked while you're alone,
I could use that information against you at any point in time.
By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...
Is that a stop sign?
Well, you'd probably want to slow down...
CECE:
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a go sign.
I don't think it's a go sign.
Because if somebody like you is sleeping with someone like her, then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!
It's just what I'm thinking.
(laughs)
And I want to talk to you.
I want to have a chance to explain.
That's okay.
I understand.
I just...
I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls 'cause we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because...
I think you're a hotty with a body.
Oh.
Um...
I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989... when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
Oh.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this weekend,
I didn't pack her inhaler.
She was having an asthma attack.
- Is Sarah okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I-I...
I just feel like I should have explained.
And I really wanted to kiss you
- the other night.
- Really?
I wanted to do more than kiss you.
I'd like to do you, at some point.
(laughs) Like, you know, really, really give it to you good.
(laughs)
Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.
I was nervous.
You were nervous?
Nick was right.
He can be really wise sometimes.
Oh, my God, it's happening!
It's coming!
I think I'm dying!
I feel scared and excited!
(vomiting)
(laughs) (continues vomiting)
What do you think?
What do I think of what?
Do you think now is the right moment?
I think so.
Okay.
NICK:
Get out of me, you poison!
(liquid splashes)
Wait.
Is that your hand?
No.
That's my hand.
- Oh, my God!
- You're welcome.
Get out of here, Dirk!
(muttering):
You get out of here...
Come here.
(exhales loudly)
(groans)
Hey!
Oh, no!
Where are you guys?
(phone ringing) (sighs)
Hello?
NICK:
Hey, where are you guys?
Hey, could I have walked out into the mountains?
When does a hill become a mountain?
It just happened.
I'm so cold.
DIRK:
Who is this?
(sighs)
Oh, my God, Dirk is dead!
(sobbing):
Dirk is dead!
Smartest guy I knew.
Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom
Tony the Tiger style.
- Naked with a kerchief?
- What?
Naked with a kerchief.
No, what do you call top, no pants?
Oh, that's like a Winnie the Pooh or a Paddington.
- Honey the Smacks Frog.
- There's a Donald the Duck.
- I guess pretty much any kind of bear except for Yogi 'cause that's naked with a tie.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.
I saw his entire butt.
Look, Dirk's a good guy.
He was my roommate when I was in law school.
- Smartest guy I know.
- So, he's a lawyer?
No, he's not a lawyer, but he does have a law degree, a business degree, and a master's in agriculture.
He's kind of like a degree collector.
He's got his PhD in poetry, so...
That sucks for poems.
How'd it go with Fancyman?
It was an amazing first date, except for one awkward part at the end.
I don't go on dates very often.
Guys my age always want to skip the date and just go right for the gold.
Which I don't give them because I'm stingy with my gold.
Unless they dig for it.
I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.
Oh, hi.
Black sedan?
Uh, yeah.
What?
So, he patted me on the back.
I thought I'd at least get a front pat.
Whoo-ha!
What?
Look, he probably just got nervous.
No, Russell's never nervous.
That's the worst answer.
Winston, what do you think?
Oh, thank God.
Hey, what's up, baby?
- Ooh.
- Hey, is that Shelby?
What was that?
That was a cat sound.
Oh, because you did the whip, we should've...
- Guys!
- It should have been the other way around.
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.
But next time you guys want advice about girls, don't come crawling to me.
- You got it.
- That sounds good.
No, that was a joke;
I love it when you guys ask me stuff.
It makes me feel really important.
- And I love it...
- "One shade the more,"
"One ray the less,"
"Had half impaired the nameless grace."
Are you wearing a ladies' scarf?
Come to my lecture tomorrow night.
Absolutely not.
She's missing out, my man.
- Hey, Schmidt?
- Yeah?
Mind if I borrow your car to take Shelby to the airport?
Oh, I don't have a car, Winston.
Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the, uh,
"man-bulance"?
The man-bulance is resting.
He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.
That's cool.
I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle all of Shelby's luggage anyway.
Ooh...
What the hell is wrong with you, Winston?
The man-bulance could fit the luggage of nine Shelbys.
It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.
You know what?
Here you go, Winston.
There you go.
- Enjoy luxury.
- All good, man.
I got your second set, so thank you.
How'd you get my second set of keys?
Hey, someone left your door open.
Someone left your face beautiful.
Who is that?
Apparently, his name is Dirk.
Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.
But should that stop you from seeing this?
Yeah!
That's awesome.
Does he keep you happy?
He does what he's told.
So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?
Oh, you're a sex-cretary?
I am definitely the boss.
Sex-cretary, he just made that up.
I hate bachelorette parties.
I have, like 50 different penis items in my carry-on.
This plane goes down, there's gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff.
Sharks?
I thought you were going to Vegas?
No, I'm going to Mexico.
I thought I told you that.
Hmm-mm.
Well, if you don't want me to go,
I don't have to go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I want you to go.
It'll be good, you know?
We spent the last five nights together.
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.
Right.
- Did I say something wrong?
- What?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you across all the space.
Hey.
Great news, um, Jess is taking a shower.
Okay, I just need, like, a good, solid ten minutes.
Eat this granola bar first.
I want to try something called the horse trough.
No, Cece.
I'm not having sex with you right now.
I have to get everybody in the company's name into a version of "We Didn't Start the Fire."
Totally fine.
What do you need, like, 20 minutes?
Cece, this...
Okay, this is real work for my real boss who is not you.
Oh, I get what's happening here.
It's 'cause Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist."
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.
So, first of all, thank you for the demotion.
And second of all, I quit.
So, I'll see you tonight.
Did you not hear anything I just said?
Oh, no, I totally heard you loud and clear, but do you know who didn't happen to hear you?
What are you doing?
Don't-don't-don't involve them.
Oh, my...
They just didn't hear.
Don't bring them into this.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Hi.
I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar,
I love...
I love you both.
All the zany adventures we've had.
But we can't go to White Castle today.
Just can't do it.
You're serious about this?
Cece?
Is Schmidt bothering you?
This is not over.
Okay?
Was it like a caress or like a...
like a pat?
No, like a pat;
It was distinctly a pat, and it was actually kind of hot.
The man knows how to pat a back.
At any point during the night, did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
Maybe.
Once or twice.
No, stop, it freaks me out and you know.
Well, what do I do?
I really, really want to see him again, like, badly.
- You just call him.
- I can't.
He's too sophisticated.
He told me he'd run with the bulls, and I quote,
"not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."
Big deal.
Just call him.
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power unless she's sexting, in which case, she gains a half power.
Okay, well, that's Schmidt just talking...
I mean, what does Schmidt know?
Look, all the guys that you live with-- boys.
You've only dated boys.
Russell is a grown man, and I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.
He has a hot air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.
Okay, sweetheart, you are sophisticated.
You've just got to pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.
You know what?
You're right:
I am sophisticated.
I'm gonna do this.
What is that?
It's a phone.
Oh, God.
And thus ends our journey through the words of time.
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan, from Dylan to Dylan.
They're both named Dylan.
- Watch him bring it home, man.
- Do I have to?
We have to rage.
"Rage against the dying of the light.
"And when the light is no longer bright."
"Don't think twice, it's all right."
It's over.
Smartest guy I know.
Professor?
- Professor?
- Yeah?
We wanted to remind you about the post-lecture wine and cheese event.
A soiree, eh?
Super classy.
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.
Yeah, I-I e-mailed you about that.
That was me.
- Oh, sometimes when I get a really long e-mail...
I don't read it.
Bye.
Oh, Mommy.
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?
You guys having problems or something?
No, no, no, everything's fine.
She left me and moved out of the house.
I guess it was "too hard to support me."
"Financially."
It's all fine; her leaving has allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.
Scarves?
Undergraduate ladies.
You see, girls our age, what do they want?
They want us to wed them, sire their children.
They want you to have
- a-a bedframe.
- Right, yeah.
Hmm?
They want you to eat off plates, but girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?

You make me so feel brave, babe, and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you, too.
I'm coming back, baby.
No space!
Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir, just me and my American heart... full of love.
Then how do you explain... this?
I can't... sir.
No one in the entire world can explain that.
I am so tall!
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.
Russell?
Oh.
Hey, Jess.
I'm not Jess.
I'm her cousin...
Sylvia?
Are you doing okay?
I want a donut.
Then let's get you a donut.
Please?
I want to talk to you... alone.
Well, this is a fun group.
Hmm.
Can you drop me off at my dorm?
It's called Hamilton.
I'd like to vomit now.
God!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was bad-ass!
- Hey, uh, kiddo.
- Okay.
- Nick, that's the road.
- What's up?
You want the woods.
I want the woods.
You're smart, Russ.
- Come here.
- Hey, it was nothing.
You're okay, Russ.
Okay, we can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.
She's not like us.
She's one of the good ones.
Time to make the puke, Russell.
So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us that our completely equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that you listen to Wicked while you're alone,
I could use that information against you at any point in time.
By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...
Is that a stop sign?
Well, you'd probably want to slow down...
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a go sign.
I don't think it's a go sign.
Because if somebody like you is sleeping with someone like her, then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!
It's just what I'm thinking.
And I want to talk to you.
I want to have a chance to explain.
That's okay.
I understand.
I just...
I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls 'cause we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because...
I think you're a hotty with a body.
Oh.
Um...
I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989... when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
Oh.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this weekend,
I didn't pack her inhaler.
She was having an asthma attack.
- Is Sarah okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I-I...
I just feel like I should have explained.
And I really wanted to kiss you
- the other night.
- Really?
I wanted to do more than kiss you.
I'd like to do you, at some point.
Like, you know, really, really give it to you good.
Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.
I was nervous.
You were nervous?
Nick was right.
He can be really wise sometimes.
Oh, my God, it's happening!
It's coming!
I think I'm dying!
I feel scared and excited!
What do you think?
What do I think of what?
Do you think now is the right moment?
I think so.
Okay.
Get out of me, you poison!
Wait.
Is that your hand?
No.
That's my hand.
- Oh, my God!
- You're welcome.
Get out of here, Dirk!
You get out of here...
Come here.
Hey!
Oh, no!
Where are you guys?
Hello?
Hey, where are you guys?
Hey, could I have walked out into the mountains?
When does a hill become a mountain?
It just happened.
I'm so cold.
Who is this?
Oh, my God, Dirk is dead!
Dirk is dead!
Greatest guy I knew.
[urinating]
Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom Tony the Tiger style.
- Naked with a kerchief?
JESS:
What?
Naked with a kerchief.
No.
What do you call top, no pants?
That's a Winnie the Pooh.
Or a Paddington.
winston:
Donald Duck.
SCHMlDT:
I guess pretty much any bear.
- Except Yogi.
That's naked with a tie.
- Alvin, Simon, Theodore.
I saw his entire butt.
Dirk's a good guy.
My roommate when I was in law school.
- Smartest guy I know.
- So he's a lawyer?
No.
But he has a law degree, business degree.
And a master's in agriculture.
He's kind of like a degree collector.
- He's getting his PhD in poetry, so...
- That sucks for poems.
How'd it go with Fancyman?
It was an amazing first date.
Except for one awkward part at the end.
I don't go on dates very often.
Guys my age always want to skip the date and just go right for the gold.
Which I don't give them because I'm stingy with my gold.
Unless they dig for it.
I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.
Oh.
Hi.
VALET:
Black sedan?
Yeah.
What?
So he patted me on the back.
I thought I'd at least get a front pat.
Hoohah!
- What?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Look, he probably got nervous.
- No.
Russell's never nervous.
That's the worst answer.
Winston?
What do you think?
[CELL PHONE rings]
- Oh, thank God.
Hey, what's up, baby?
nick:
Hey, is that Shelby?
- Reer!
- What's that?
Cat sound.
Oh, because you did the whip, we should--
Guys.
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.
But next time you guys want advice about girls, don't come crawling to me.
- Got it.
- Sounds good.
No, that was a joke.
I love it when you ask me stuff, it makes me feel important.
- And I love it when--
- One shade the more, one ray the less
Had half impaired the nameless grace
- Are you wearing a lady's scarf?
- Come to my lecture tomorrow night.
Absolutely not.
She's missing out, my man.
Schmidt.
Borrow your car, take Shelby to the airport?
Oh, I don't have a car, Winston.
Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the...
- ...man-bulance?
- Man-bulance is resting.
To get ready for the team-building retreat Monday.
I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle Shelby's luggage anyway.
What is wrong with you, Winston?
The man-bulance fits the luggage of nine Shelbys.
It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.
You know what, here you go, Winston.
There.
Enjoy luxury.
All good, man.
I got your second set, so thank you.
- How'd you get my keys?
- Someone left your door open.
Someone left your face beautiful.
- Who is that?
- Apparently his name is Dirk.
Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.
But should that stop you from seeing this?
- Yeah.
That's awesome.
- Does he keep you happy?
- He does what he's told.
dirk:
Yeah.
So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?
- Oh, your sex-cretary.
- I am definitely the boss.
Sex-cretary, he just made that up.
JESS [singing]:
Who's that girl?
CHORUS:
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
CHORUS:
Who's that girl?
It's Jess
I hate bachelorette parties.
I have 50 different penis items in my carry-on.
If this plane goes down there's going to be sharks doing weird stuff.
- I thought you were going to Vegas?
- No.
Mexico.
I thought I told you that.
Well, if you don't want me to go, I don't have to go.
No, no, no.
I want you to go.
It'll be good.
We've spent the last five nights together.
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.
Right.
- Did I say something wrong?
- I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you across all the space.
Hey.
Great news.
Um, Jess is taking a shower.
Okay, I just need like, a good, solid 10 minutes.
Eat this granola bar first.
I want to try something called the horse trough.
No, Cece.
I'm not having sex with you right now.
I have to get everybody in a version of "We Didn't Start the Fire."
Totally fine, what do you need, like 20 minutes?
Cece, this-
- Okay, this is real work.
For my real boss.
Who is not you.
Oh, I get what's happening here.
It's because Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist"?
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.
So first of all, thank you for the demotion.
- Second of all, I quit.
- So I'll see you tonight.
- Did you not hear anything I just said?
- Oh, no I totally heard you, loud and clear.
But do you know who didn't happen to hear you?
What are you doing?
Don't-
- Don't involve them.
- Oh, my--
- They just didn't hear.
- Don't bring them into this.
- Don't tell me, tell them.
SCHMlDT:
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi, guys.
Harold.
Kumar.
I love you both.
Oh, the zany adventures we've had.
But we can't go to White Castle today.
Just can't do it.
You're serious about this?
JESS:
Cece?
Is Schmidt bothering you?
This is not over.
Okay?
- Was it like a caress or like a pat?
- No, like a pat.
It was distinctly a pat.
It was kind of hot.
That man knows how to pat a back.
At any point during the night did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
[imitates KERMlT] Maybe once or twice.
Stop.
It freaks me out, you know.
What do I do?
I really, really want to see him again.
Like, badly.
- Just call him.
- I can't.
He's too sophisticated.
He told me he'd run with the bulls.
And I quote, "Not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."
Big deal.
Just call him.
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power.
Unless she's sexting, in which case she gains a half-power.
That's Schmidt just talking-- What does Schmidt know?
Look, all the guys that you live with, boys.
You've only dated boys.
Russell is a grown man.
I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.
He has a hot-air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.
Sweetheart, you are sophisticated.
You just gotta pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.
You know what, you're right.
I am sophisticated.
I'm gonna do this.
- What is that?
- It's a phone.
Oh, God.
Thus ends our journey through the words of time.
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan.
From Dylan to Dylan.
They're both named Dylan.
- Watch him bring it home.
- I have to?
We have to rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And when the light is no longer bright.
[playing harmonica]
Don't think twice, it's all right.
It's over.
[cheering]
Smartest guy I know.
Professor?
- Professor?
- Yeah.
We wanted to remind you about the wine and cheese event.
The soiree, eh?
Super classy.
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.
I e-mailed you about that.
That was me.
Sometimes when I get a really long e-mail I don't read it.
Oh, mommy.
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?
- You guys having problems or something?
- No, no, no, everything's fine.
She left me and moved out of the house.
I guess it was "too hard" to support me.
"Financially." It's all fine.
Allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.
- Scarves?
- Undergraduate ladies.
Girls our age, what do they want?
They want us to wed them.
Sire their children.
They want you to have a bed frame.
They want you to eat off plates.
Girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Don't they hang out with guys their own age?
Hung with a 20-year-old dude lately?
Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low.
Haven't gone through their gay phase yet.
I'm gonna call Shelby and see if everything's all right.
- Sounds good, man.
- What, dude?
Relax.
Okay?
I just said we're giving space.
Doesn't mean I can't call her to see if anything funny happened on the plane.
You know what space means, right?
Space to have sex with other people.
No, space means you go to Mexico and you do not have sex with other people.
Watch this.
Nick, don't give me any space.
You got it, my man.
See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now.
Now, Nick, I want you to give me some space.
All this space allows me the opportunity to have as much sex as we want.
- Smartest guy I know.
- See how much sex?
That does not--
Get out of my way, bookworms!
Ready to make love to some college chicks?
- When is the last time you had mono?
- Don't know.
Tomorrow you're gonna say yesterday.
CECE:
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.
What are you wearing?
I don't-
- I don't know.
I found this at the lost-and-found at the gym.
I'm not quite sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.
Never had to do this.
I've never had to seduce somebody before.
If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my Aunt Frieda at seder.
Come on, okay?
I will do anything.
And I'll do it anywhere.
All right?
Even Fantasy Location Number Three?
Okay.
Um...
How good are the Beatles?
The Beatles are the best.
- Were you so upset when they broke up?
- I would've been.
But I was 1.
Heh.
Well, you're not 1 anymore.
Heh.
How's your prostate?
I had my breast exam last weekend.
Like, they're fine.
It's just boob in there.
But we have to be careful.
Our bodies are decaying.
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
Why didn't we kiss the other night?
Sorry.
[PHONE buzzing]
- I am sorry.
- No, it's fine.
Oh!
- What?
Is everything okay?
- I gotta go.
This ought to take care of that.
Dinner, okay?
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without--
Here, there's cab fare.
Get home safe.
[voicemail BEEPS]
Baby, I don't want anyone to have space.
I want to be standing right in front of you.
I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.
I want to pass air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.
No flights.
Hey, Schmidt, you mind if I borrow your car again?
"Of course you can, Winston, you're so great." Thank you!
[tires screeching]
[HlP-HOP music playing OVER SPEAKERS]
I find myself in my new Cadillac
Hello, my name is Nicholas.
Nick.
Nick.
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.
Oh, I do.
Look, I feel so old here.
Is calling a girl "shorty" still cool?
We gotta find your angle with these girls.
Your hook.
Your panty-melter.
Usually my hook is that it's closing time and I'm there.
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.
If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.
- Hey.
nick:
Don't do that.
dirk:
Skyler.
Miriam.
Come over here.
nick:
Don't humiliate me.
- How cool is my friend?
- Are you a professor too?
- No, no, no.
I'm a bartender.
Who's 30 years old.
I don't have health insurance.
You know how to make drinks?
[whispering] Panty-melter.
Do I know how to make drinks?
- Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?
- Yeah, I do that professionally.
You could get me drunk professionally?
- Are you a cop?
Ha-ha-ha.
- Sometimes.
- Do you have identification on you?
- Ha-ha-ha.
I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.
Five nights a week.
- Jess!
You made it to the party!
- What's going on?
Why is the cast of The Social Network in our apartment?
Dirk is a genius.
Twenty-year-old girls, they think I'm awesome.
And look at them.
They don't know what Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!
Can you believe it?
Where's your Fancyman?
I don't know.
It was horrible.
He left and he gave me $100 for a cab.
And you know what?
I'm gonna use the remaining 90 to get out of here and start a new life.
It's been nice knowing you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm gonna die alone.
- Oh, no.
- I am so, so sad right now.
- Oh!
My heart hurts.
Want Nick to make you a Bayberry Breeze?
He is so smart.
- So smart.
- Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm not happy!
Thirty sucks!
Weird party move.
[STEPHEN SCHWARTZ'S "defying gravity" playing ON CAR STEREO]
[singing] You and I defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity
[whispering] It's been two hours.
This is officially crazy.
- Also, I have to go to the bathroom.
- [whispering] Just pee yourself.
So you'd rather sit in urine for the rest of the ride than admit that we're sleeping together?
Yep.
Absolutely.
Don't even have to think about it.
I don't wanna ruin what we have, okay?
Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions like:
"Cece, why are you sleeping with him?" And, "Seriously, why?"
You think we have something to ruin?
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.
And I was wearing shoulder pads.
So I obviously must like sleeping with you.
Secre-tarty.
Shut up.
This is pretty great.
- I'm freezing.
- Yeah.
I'm so cold.
How are you not freezing?
Does your brown skin retain heat?

Babe, I don't want space.
SHELBY [ON PHONE]:
Neither do I.
That's why I'm at your apartment.
- I got on a plane.
I wanted to see you.
- What?
Babe, look.
I'm in Mexico.
I came to see you.
- Are you serious?
- I miss you, Shelby.
You're so sexy, girl.
In or out of the wig.
I don't care.
Shelby, you make me feel so brave.
And I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you too.
I'm coming back, baby.
No space.
You traveling with any non-U.S. citizens?
[LAUGHS]
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir.
Just me and my American heart full of love.
Then how do you explain this?
I can't, sir.
[LAUGHS]
No one in the entire world can explain that.
[HlP-HOP music playing OVER SPEAKERS]
I'm so tall.
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.

Yes!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was badass!
- Hey, Nick, that's the road.
- Okay.
What's up?
- You want the woods.
- Woods.
You're smart.
- Come here.
- lt was nothing.
nick:
You're okay, Russ.
- Okay.
We can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.

I wanna have a chance to explain.
That's okay.
I understand.
I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls because we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because I think you're a hottie with a body.
Um...
I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I've forgotten really how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989 when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this week and I didn't pack her inhaler.
She had an asthma attack.

Yeah, thanks.

Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the, uh,

The man-bulance is resting.
He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.
That's cool.
I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle all of Shelby's luggage anyway.

I hate bachelorette parties.
I have, like 50 different penis items in my carry-on.
This plane goes down, there's gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff.
Sharks?
I thought you were going to Vegas?
No, I'm going to Mexico.
I thought I told you that.
Hmm-mm.
Well, if you don't want me to go,
I don't have to go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I want you to go.
It'll be good, you know?
We spent the last five nights together.
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.
Right.
- Did I say something wrong?
- What?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you across all the space.
Hey.
Great news, um, Jess is taking a shower.
Okay, I just need, like, a good, solid ten minutes.
Eat this granola bar first.
I want to try something called the horse trough.
No, Cece.
I'm not having sex with you right now.
I have to get everybody in the company's name into a version of "We Didn't Start the Fire."
Totally fine.
What do you need, like, 20 minutes?
Cece, this...
Okay, this is real work for my real boss who is not you.
Oh, I get what's happening here.
It's 'cause Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist."
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.
So, first of all, thank you for the demotion.
And second of all, I quit.
So, I'll see you tonight.
Did you not hear anything I just said?
Oh, no, I totally heard you loud and clear, but do you know who didn't happen to hear you?
What are you doing?
Don't-don't-don't involve them.
Oh, my...
They just didn't hear.
Don't bring them into this.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Hi.
I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar,
I love...
I love you both.
All the zany adventures we've had.
But we can't go to White Castle today.
Just can't do it.
You're serious about this?
Cece?
Is Schmidt bothering you?
This is not over.
Okay?
Was it like a caress or like a...
like a pat?
No, like a pat;
It was distinctly a pat, and it was actually kind of hot.
The man knows how to pat a back.
At any point during the night, did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
Maybe.
Once or twice.
No, stop, it freaks me out and you know.
Well, what do I do?
I really, really want to see him again, like, badly.
- You just call him.
- I can't.
He's too sophisticated.
He told me he'd run with the bulls, and I quote,
"not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."
Big deal.
Just call him.
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power unless she's sexting, in which case, she gains a half power.
Okay, well, that's Schmidt just talking...
I mean, what does Schmidt know?
Look, all the guys that you live with-- boys.
You've only dated boys.
Russell is a grown man, and I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.
He has a hot air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.
Okay, sweetheart, you are sophisticated.
You've just got to pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.
I am sophisticated.
I'm gonna do this.
What is that?
It's a phone.
Oh, God.
And thus ends our journey through the words of time.
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan, from Dylan to Dylan.
They're both named Dylan.
- Watch him bring it home, man.
- Do I have to?
We have to rage.
"Rage against the dying of the light.
"And when the light is no longer bright."
"Don't think twice, it's all right."
It's over.
Smartest guy I know.
Professor?
- Professor?
- Yeah?
We wanted to remind you about the post-lecture wine and cheese event.
A soiree, eh?
Super classy.
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.
Yeah, I-I e-mailed you about that.
- That was me.
- Oh, sometimes when I get a really long e-mail...
I don't read it.
Bye.
Oh, Mommy.
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?
You guys having problems or something?
No, no, no, everything's fine.
She left me and moved out of the house.
I guess it was "too hard to support me."
"Financially."
It's all fine; her leaving has allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.
Scarves?
Undergraduate ladies.
You see, girls our age, what do they want?
They want us to wed them, sire their children.
They want you to have
- a-a bedframe.
- Right, yeah.
Hmm?
They want you to eat off plates, but girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?
Have you hung out with a 20-year-old dude lately?
- Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low.
- Right.
- They haven't even gone through their gay phase yet.
- Hey, man, I'm gonna give Shelby a call really quick.
Just want to check on her, see if everything's all right.
- Sounds good, man.
- What, dude, relax, okay?
I just said we're gonna give each other space, doesn't mean I can't call her, right, to see if anything funny happened on the plane.
You know what "space" means, right?
That's space to have sex with other people.
No, space means you go to Mexico, and you do not have sex with other people.
Watch this.
Nick, don't give my any space.
You got it, my man.
See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now, doesn't it?
Now, Nick, I want you
- to give me some space.
- You got it.
All this space allows me opportunity to have as much sex as we want.
Smartest guy I know.
See how much sex
- we could be having?
- That-that does...
Get out of my way, bookworms!
You ready to make love to some college chicks?
Hey, when's the last time you had mono?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, you're gonna say yesterday.
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.
What... are you wearing?
I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I found this at the lost and found at the gym.
I'm not really sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.
I've never had to do this.
I've never had to seduce somebody before.
If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my aunt Frieda at Seder.
Come on, okay?
I will do anything, and I'll do it anywhere.
All right?
Even fantasy location... number three?
Okay.
Um, how good are the Beatles?
Beatles are the best.
Were you so upset when they broke up?
I would have been, but I was one.
Well, you're not one any more.
How's your prostate?
- Uh...
- I had my breast exam last week, and, like, they're fine.
It's just boob in there, but we have to be careful.
Our bodies are decaying.
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
Why didn't we kiss the other night?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.
- Oh.
- What?
- Hey, I...
- Is everything okay?
Oh.
- I got to go.
- This ought to take care of the dinner.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without, um...
Here, there's cab fare.
- Get home safe.
- Oh.
Baby, look, I don't want space, okay?
I don't want anyone to have space.
I want to be standing right in front of you.
I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.
I want to just be passing air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.
No flights tonight.
Hey, Schmidt, do you mind if I borrow your car again?
"Of course you can, Winston.
You're so great."
Thank you!
Nope.
Hey, my name's Nicholas.
Nick, Nick.
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.
Oh, I do.
Dirk, I feel so old here.
Is calling a girl "Shorty" still cool?
We just got to find your angle with these college girls.
Your hook, your panty-melter.
Usually, my hook is that it's closing time, and I'm there.
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.
If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.
Hey.
- Don't-don't do this.
- Skyler, Miriam,
- come over here for a second.
- Don't humiliate me, Dirk.
How cool is my friend, Nick?
Are you a professor, too?
No, no, no, I'm a bartender.
30 years old,
I don't have health insurance.
You know how to make drinks?
Panty-melter.
Do I know how to make drinks, did you say?
Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?
Yeah, I do that professionally.
You could get me drunk professionally?
Are you a cop?
Sometimes.
Do you have identification on you?
I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.
Five nights a week.
Jess, you made it to the party!
What's going on?
Why is the cast of the Social Network in our apartment?
Dirk is a genius!
20-year-old girls-- they think I'm awesome!
And look at 'em!
They don't know what Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!
Can you believe it?
Where's your Fancyman?
Where is he?
I don't know.
It was horrible.
He left and gave me $100 for a cab!
You know what?
I'm gonna use the remaining 90 to get out of here and start a new life.
It's been nice knowing you.
Hey...!
I'm gonna die alone!
Oh, no!
I am so, so sad right now.
My heart hurts!
You want Nick to make you a bayberry breeze?
- 'Cause he is so smart.
- So smart.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do!
This.
I'm not happy!
30 sucks!
Ah, weird party move.
# It's time to try defying gravity #
# I think I'll try defying gravity #
It's been two hours.
This is officially crazy.
Also, I have to go to the bathroom.
Just pee yourself.
So you'd rather sit in my urine for the rest of the car ride than admit to Winston that we're sleeping together?
Yep, absolutely.
Don't even have to think about it.
I don't want to ruin what we have, okay?
Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions, like, "Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"
And, "Seriously, why?"
You think we have something to ruin?
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.
And I was wearing shoulder pads.
So I obviously must like sleeping with you.
A secre-tarty.
Shut... up.
This is pretty great.
I'm freezing.
- Yeah.
- I'm so cold.
How are you not freezing?
Does brown skin retain heat?
# Instead of dreary who-you-were, well, are #
# There's nothing that can stop you from becoming popular #
# Lar #
# La, la #
# La, ah-ah, ah... #
Take out your tampon and drink, Trevor!
The Flip Queen has spoken!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Shelby.
Babe, I don't want space.
Neither do I!
That's why I'm at your apartment.
I got on a plane.
I wanted to see you.
What?
!
Babe, look, I'm in Mexico.
I came to see you.
Are you serious?
I miss you, Shelby.
You're so sexy, girl.
In or out of the wig.
I don't care.
Shelby.
You make me so feel brave, babe, and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you, too.
I'm coming back, baby.
No space!
Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir, just me and my American heart... full of love.
Then how do you explain... this?
I can't... sir.
No one in the entire world can explain that.
I am so tall!
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.
Russell?
Oh.
Hey, Jess.
I'm not Jess.
I'm her cousin...
Sylvia?
Are you doing okay?
I want a donut.
Then let's get you a donut.
Please?
I want to talk to you... alone.
Well, this is a fun group.
Hmm.
Can you drop me off at my dorm?
It's called Hamilton.
I'd like to vomit now.
God!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was bad-ass!
- Hey, uh, kiddo.
- Okay.
- Nick, that's the road.
- What's up?
You want the woods.
I want the woods.
You're smart, Russ.
- Come here.
- Hey, it was nothing.
You're okay, Russ.
Okay, we can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.
She's not like us.
She's one of the good ones.
Time to make the puke, Russell.
So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us that our completely equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that you listen to Wicked while you're alone,
I could use that information against you at any point in time.
By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...
Is that a stop sign?
Well, you'd probably want to slow down...
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a go sign.
I don't think it's a go sign.
Because if somebody like you is sleeping with someone like her, then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!
It's just what I'm thinking.
And I want to talk to you.
I want to have a chance to explain.
That's okay.
I understand.
I just...
I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls 'cause we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because...
I think you're a hotty with a body.
Oh.
Um...
I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989... when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
Oh.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this weekend,
I didn't pack her inhaler.
She was having an asthma attack.
- Is Sarah okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I-I...
I just feel like I should have explained.
And I really wanted to kiss you
- the other night.
- Really?
I wanted to do more than kiss you.
I'd like to do you, at some point.
Like, you know, really, really give it to you good.
Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.
I was nervous.
You were nervous?
Nick was right.
He can be really wise sometimes.
Oh, my God, it's happening!
It's coming!
I think I'm dying!
I feel scared and excited!
What do you think?
What do I think of what?
Do you think now is the right moment?
I think so.
Okay.
Get out of me, you poison!
Wait.
Is that your hand?
No.
That's my hand.
- Oh, my God!
- You're welcome.
Get out of here, Dirk!
You get out of here...
Come here.
Hey!
Oh, no!
Where are you guys?
Hello?
Hey, where are you guys?
Hey, could I have walked out into the mountains?
When does a hill become a mountain?
It just happened.
I'm so cold.
Who is this?
Oh, my God, Dirk is dead!
Dirk is dead!
Smartest guy I knew.
Norther
All right, just one more beer, and then I need to get home and help Molly with last-minute wedding stuff.
What about helping me with the bachelor party?
I'm tired of you making this whole wedding about you and Molly.
Now, time for the tough questions.
Number one:
Topless or all-nude?
Whatever, I just don't want to get dragged onstage by three girls named Cinnamon so they can play "let's humiliate the fat guy."
Hey, it's not humiliating.
They just take your shirt off, strap you to a chair, and rub their oily butts in your face.
Don't read too much into this, but I had a very similar experience at boy scout camp and that wasn't at all sexy.
Noted.
So you're probably gonna want one of the classier places... not too near the railroad tracks or a mental institution.
Exactly... maybe one that provides a limo service so we can all drink.
No, no, the places that offer the free shuttles are usually desperate for customers, so I'm guessing those girls are probably all-nude and half-dude.
Well, we don't want to spin that wheel.
No, we don't.
It's hard to enjoy bonding with your buddies when you got some he-she shaking her furry gonads in your face.
Again, boy scout camp.
Okay, so no he-shes and we rent our own limo, but keep in mind, the all-nude joints do not serve alcohol.
We're definitely gonna want booze.
It is my bachelor party.
Absolutely.
'Cause when you're pleasantly buzzed, a strip club is like an erotic sexual playpen.
Stone-cold sober, and you're just a dirty freak paying an unwed mother to smack you around with her silicone funbags.
Well, if the father of the groom gets a vote,
I say all-nude and get drunk in the parking lot.
Dad?
♪ For the first time in my life ♪
♪ I see love. ♪
close that gaping pie hole and give your old man a hug.
Yes, sir.
You dropped some tonnage boy.
My hands can actually wave at each other behind your back.
How long you been sitting here?
You walked by me twice.
I guess we know why you haven't made detective yet.
You gonna introduce me to your best man?
Oh, yeah, dad, this is my partner Carl McMillan.
And you, sir, need no introduction.
Sergeant Jack Biggs is legendary around our precinct.
I see the department's still big on going salt and pepper in their squad car.
I rode with a black fella for years.
Officer Tony Clemments.
Great guy...
used to call me fat Casper.
Hell of a cop.
His second wife blew a hole in him with a 12-gauge.
She was white.
I mean, just saying, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
Well, we certainly have our good days and bad days.
Sit down, dad.
I thought you weren't coming to town until next week.
Well, that was the plan, but your stepmom and I are going through kind of a rough patch.
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
Eh, marriage has its ups and downs.
One day you're madly in love, the next day you're fishing your clothes out of the birdbath and sleeping in the backseat of your Buick Skylark.
Well, I'm sure things will work out.
Better than it did for poor Tony.
I'd rather have to fight some crow for my undies instead of getting donut-holed by some crazy bitch with a shotgun.
Ain't that the truth?
Poor bastard never saw it coming.
How could he?
He was laying on the neighbor lady.
Hey.
To Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
I'm sure happy for you, son, but I hope you've sown all your wild oats.
I've done fine in that area, dad.
I married your mom too young and I was trapped.
Year after year, making love to the same woman in the same position with the same time limit.
Time limit?
Your mother would say,
"when Mork and Mindy is finished, so are you."
Well, look, I appreciate your fatherly advice, but I've lived most of my life without it and I'm doing just fine.
Oh, I see, you're a man now.
You got it all figured out, do you?
I bet I can still pin your ass in under six seconds.
Dad, no, I'm not going to wrestle you.
Nothing to be scared of.
I'm just an old man talking gibberish.
Stop it.
What's the matter, you going to cry?
Did your mama raise you to be a big sissy girl?
All right, it's on, old man!
Mike, is that you?
Hi, sweetie, this is my dad.
Hey, sunshine, nice to meet you.
You, too.
Oh, I can see the resemblance.
So this is Mike's father, huh?
Still got most of his hair;
That's a good sign.
I think baldness is on the mom's side and it skips a generation.
Oh, that's right.
I saw pictures of Vince's maternal grandma.
She looked like tweetie pie with a monobrow.
Whoa.
Apparently that doesn't skip a generation.
And it doesn't get cuter with age.
All in all, though, a pleasant looking man.
Yeah, hard to believe he was married to Mike's mom.
Well, based on his breath,
I'm guessing the whiskey impaired his judgment.
- Morning.
- Shh.
Hey, sweetie, do you want some breakfast?
I got a pretty bad hangover.
Just coffee for now.
I'll eat after I throw up.
Listen, I'm happy your dad is staying here, but you need to get him out of the house tonight.
You want me to take him to my bachelor party?
Well, I certainly don't want him here for my bachelorette party with your mother in attendance.
What, why the hell is my mom coming?
Because you said, and I quote,
"I think it'd be nice if you asked my mother..."
Okay, first of all, I do not talk like that, and second of all,
I can't take my dad to my bachelor party.
He'll ruin everything.
Ruin what?
You said you were just going to
"grab a steak, smoke a cigar, drink some scotch..."
Is that seriously how you think I sound?
Wait a minute, you don't want your dad to go along because Carl is taking you to a strip club.
What?
He'd better not be.
I hate those places.
The guys are all perverts, the women are all sad.
I can't think of a worse place to have a bachelor party.
Yuck.
Fine, I'll take my dad!
See, you sound just like yourself.
Didn't see you in the cafeteria today.
You missed a good one.
Frito pie and blueberry crumble.
That's why the windows are open.
Hey, grease, cheese, and fritos.
It ain't gonna come out pretty.
Anyway, I brought you a little something.
What's this for?
Well, I won't be attending your soirée tonight, so I thought I'd give you my gift here.
And don't get your hopes up... it's not dirty, and you can't eat it.
Oh, you're not coming?
Aw, gosh, that's just a stinker.
Darn it.
Hey, cut the crap.
You and I both know you only invited me 'cause Mike told you to.
What?
It was totally my idea.
I love your company.
You are a hoot.
Well, I got better things to do than sitting at a hen party, drinking pink squirrels, and giggling over rubber wienies.
I understand your trepidation.
Plus, you might want to steer clear of my house.
Your ex is in town and he's staying with us.
So Jack's here?
Yeah, and it's probably best if you guys don't have your first eye-to-eye in 20 years in my living room.
It's hard enough getting my mom's red wine stains out of the rug.
Hey, I got no beef with the man.
Nothing to prove and no ax to grind.
Really?
Oh, I moved on with my life long ago.
Did he bring the whore?
No, he came by himself.
Between you and me,
I think there's a little trouble in paradise.
Hmm, what a shame.
Sure do hate to hear that, when bad things happen to nice people.
What time is your shindig again?
Uh, s-seven-ish.
Why?
Well, you're going to be my daughter-in-law and I'd hate to miss your special night.
You know what?
You're right.
It'll probably get pretty raunchy, so don't come.
I'll be by early to help you set up.
I'll bring some sipping whiskey and an x-rated board game.
X-rated board game?
Dirty scrabble.
It's actually just regular scrabble with extra fs, bs, and js.
Man, I can't believe you're bringing your dad to my bachelor party.
I thought it was my bachelor party.
Did you plan it?
Are you the one that's been going to strip clubs for three months, trying to find the best one?
I'm sorry, Carl, there's nothing I can do.
I can't leave him at Molly's house.
My mom's going to be there.
So why don't you drop your dad off at a movie or buy him a sweat suit and let him walk the mall?
Yeah, old people love going all knees and elbows at the mall.
He's coming, and I don't want to hear another word about it.
He'll ruin everything.
You ever seen strippers around a cute, old dude?
It's like bringing a puppy or a midget.
They get all the attention.
I promise I'll keep him occupied.
You guys can still have a good time.
Yeah, a stripper slaps him in the face with her boob and his teeth wind up in my watery sprite.
Hey, Molly.
What?
My mom's on her way to the house?
Yeah, my dad's there.
He's probably still asleep on the couch.
All right, on my way.
Hit the siren.
We got to get there before we have to arrest my mom and tag and bag my dad.
This is gonna be nice.
Just us gals sitting around, sipping some cocktails, having a little girl talk.
Sure.
But keep in the back of your mind, it's not too late to go out and do something fun.
Yeah, I was hoping for a big hunk of penis-shaped cake, or seeing a big hunk's penis.
Mom.
Ooh, there's a place you can go downtown where you can lick whipped cream off a guy's bare chest.
Ooh.
Won't be able to do that after you're married.
Have you met my fiancé?
His chest hair's like an easter basket.
That's not hyperbole.
One time, I actually found a jelly bean.
Two of them have to make everything dirty.
It's like my confirmation party all over again.
Whoa.
Peggy.
Hope I'm not too early.
Boys still here?
No, they left.
Damn it!
Are you okay?
Couldn't be better.
Here you go.
Another gift for the bride-to-be.
Please tell me that's French bread.
Okay, but that French bread's black, and it vibrates.
Thanks for letting me join you boys.
I'm sure none of you fellas wanted the groom's old man tagging along.
Happy to have you, dad.
Right, guys?
Sorry we had to rush you out of the house so early.
Mom was coming over, and I didn't want a repeat of our last little get-together.
Yeah, I still got the scar where she clocked me behind the ear with that disposable camera.
It did liven up my high school graduation, though.
And believe it or not, the pictures still came out great.
So, what's the deal?
Are we going to a strip club, or are you guys going to be the biggest boobs I see all night?
We can't go to a nudie bar this early.
The sun's still out, and our coupons don't kick in till 7:00 P.M.
Plus, the day shift is still on the pole, and they're tired, cranky and sometimes pregnant.
Not to mention the sad, desperate clientele that hangs out there during the day.
Lonely losers blowing their rent money, trying to get one of the girls to love 'em back.
And they never do.
I got a lot of respect for you, kid.
If I were dealt your hand, I'd have jumped in the lake with a pocket full of rocks years ago.
My mom sews my pockets shut.
Look, we got this limo for the whole night.
It's climate-controlled, got a fully-stocked bar, and we can go anywhere we want in one of the greatest cities in the world.
You guys thinking what I'm thinking?
White castle drive-thru?
God, you can read me like a book.
Well, it's easy when every chapter is titled, "I could eat."
It's just a little something
I thought might come in handy on the honeymoon.
Ooh!
Sexy panties?
No.
Flavored love jellies?
No.
Ball gag and nipple clamps?
God, no!
It's just a clip-on book light.
I thought we weren't going dirty.
Oh, my goodness.
I wonder who that is.
I hope someone didn't call the police, because we were being too loud and naughty.
Please tell me that she didn't get a stripper.
Please tell me she didn't say "ball gag."
Oh, no, officer.
Are we in trouble?
Big trouble.
There's the ringleader.
And she's been a bad, bad girl.
I've been worse.
I'm hiding drugs, and I ain't got pockets.
Well, you'll all pay the price, but the bride-to-be gets the first crack.
Enjoy, ladies.
Touch, cup or tug...
he's paid for till 10:00.
That is... very nice, but I really would just like to know your secret for hair removal.
All right, we still got another hour to kill before we can head over to the strip club.
Only an hour?
But I was so enjoying this man-thigh on man-thigh action.
Well, if we're looking for something to do, we could swing by my mom's, and I could prove to her I do to have friends.
Seriously, I would have plugged in the toaster and jumped right in the tub.
God love you.
Well, since we got the time, why don't we go ahead and do our little Mike Biggs tribute?
No, come on.
Why don't we moon that kid at the gas station again?
He'd never expect it a second time.
No, this evening is about celebrating you, Mike Biggs.
The man, the myth, the Mountain.
Come on, son, let your friends honor you.
You think this is gonna be an honor?
It's gonna be a bunch of smart-ass comments, humiliating stories and half a dozen fat jokes.
Hey, these are your pals.
I'm sure these guys have plenty more to talk about besides your waistline.
I'm out.
I grabbed the fat ball and ran with it.
I said nothing about fat, but I did lean pretty hard on your homoerotic relationship with Carl.
With friends like these, huh, dad?
Yeah.
- I'll go.
- All right, Harry.
Let me have it.
How do you say "I love you"
to your hero?
I don't think you do.
I don't mean to belabor it, but how do you even get out of bed in the morning?
Okay, fun's over.
Take these cuffs off.
Okay, pal, that is getting very close to my face.
That's what they're talking about when they say,
"the long arm of the law."
It's not funny.
No, that was pretty funny.
When she said arm, she meant penis.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no.
Stop...
No, stop it!
Oh, my God, is that thing winking at me?
"And even though we kid around a lot,
"when you get down to it, I could not have asked
"for a better partner or a better friend.
"I know you always have my back, and I always have yours.
"And I'm so happy you found Molly, because you deserve a partner as good as the one I got."
Thanks, pal.
To the man of the hour, Mr. Mike Biggs.
Hear, hear.
Salud.
Love you, man.
Lovely toast.
Really beautiful.
How come his is beautiful, and I'm a "big, sappy fruit?"
I don't know.
They're saying now it's genetics.
Oh.
"All nude, girls, girls, girls.
" Mm-hmm.
Boy, that sounds way better than all men and farts, farts, farts.
Remember not to lay out all your cash at the rail.
Buck at a time, like you're feeding baby ducks.
I've given myself a $200 limit, so if you see me reach for my ATM card, throw a cold beer in my lap.
All right, I'll see you gentlemen inside.
Only thing better than an old guy or a midget?
Blind guy.
Hey, wait up!
Somebody's got to lead me in.
You ready, dad?
I'll meet you inside what's the matter?
I'm just...
So proud of how you've turned out.
You got people who love and respect you.
And I know it's not because of me.
It's in spite of me.
Oh, don't say that.
It's true.
I ran off and left you, and at a time when a boy really needs his dad.
That's in the past.
You're here now.
That's all that matters.
Appreciate you letting me off the hook.
I promise I'll make it up to you, try to be more of a dad than I have been.
I'd like that.
Hey, what do you say we get the limo driver to cruise us around the old neighborhood?
It's your night.
Do whatever you want.
But I'm heading in.
Ah, it'd be a shame to waste this precious father-son time.
I hope you and the wife work things out.
Well, if we don't,
I think I got a real shot with that Cuban stripper.
I think she really liked you.
Yeah.
I mean, until you ran out of money.
Yeah, strip clubs aren't a good place for a man on a fixed income.
By the way, my last three lap dances were your wedding present.
Well, it's important for you to enjoy what little time you got left, old man.
Oh, game on, boy.
Hello, Jack.
Long time, no see.
This is lieutenant sexy, and he's giving me a ride home.
Then he's gonna drop me off at the house.
Get it?
Who the hell was that?
I have no idea.
Him, I know.
Hey.
All right.
Who put the shapes in the sorter for Hope?
She's never going to learn if we keep doing it for her.
I didn't do it.
I've just been playing with this slinky for the past two hours.
Oh, my God, she's doing it on her own.
She can do the shape-sorter.
Good job, sweetie.
That's better than good.
That is amazing.
I mean, you were still struggling with that toy when you were four.
Virginia!
He's getting frustrated again.
Bring the sugar!
Stupid star!
You never really did have a knack for the shape-sorter.
We finally just took that toy away and gave you a bucket of checkers.
We said if you could just pick out one at a time, you win!
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
Ooh, I was awesome at Checker-Bucket.
How the hell do you open this thing?
Ah, you're such a good mom.
Ohh... cute.
What is she, about two?
Just about.
She play with the shape-sorter yet?
Not yet.
She gets frustrated.
My daughter's a whiz at it.
Have you tried making a Checker-Bucket?
It's where you put the checkers in, and let them take it out one at at a time.
It's good for the slower kids.
That's what my parents did for me.
Oh, they must be very proud.
Are you able to live on your own, sweetheart?
Not yet.
Well, someday.
Still annoying customers by bragging about your genius baby?
I was gonna go with "highly gifted,"
but if you want to throw the word "genius" around,
Every time I'd answer more Jeopardy questions than him, he'd accuse me of sleeping with Alex Trebek.
It's a tough thing for a 12-year-old.
Well, I'm not threatened.
Besides, it's not like she's smarter than me.
- She's a baby.
- Well, not yet.
But if she's not even two and she's smarter than you were at four, then it's only a matter of time before she's smarter than you.
Do the math.
I can't do the math.
I can't do the math!
Okay.
I was four and she's two.
So, when she's four, I'll be eight.
No, wait a second.
That's not right.
Sucks, man.
I'm glad we never had to worry about a kid being smarter than us.
- Hey!
- No offense.
But we always knew you'd be dumb.
'Cause we're both dumb.
And that's how it works.
Your problem is, you made a baby with someone much smarter than you.
You really think Lucy was that much smarter than me?
She was a college graduate who avoided the police for years while she went on a murder spree.
You're a high school dropout who's been arrested five times for peeing in public.
So, yeah, I'd say she's much smarter than you.
Look, Jimmy, it's like the birds and the bees.
Two birds have a baby, they have a bird.
Two bees have a baby, they have a bee.
You're like a bee that had a baby with a bird.
Now the bird's gone.
And now you're a bee trying to raise a bird-bee.
Makes sense.
So how's a bee supposed to be able to raise a bird-bee?
I'm not smart enough for that.
And I don't know if I'm going to find another bird to marry.
She's going to have questions.
She's going to think I'm stupid.
This doesn't solve everything.
It is good, though.
What do they put in it to make it taste so sweet?
Hello.
Welcome to High School Equivalency Class.
"I don't know" is not an answer, Mr. Chance.
It's Drakkar Noir.
I hate this class.
I want to live in a classless society.
Okay, you're mixing up two different uses of the word "class."
Man, why do you always have to correct everything when I talk?
It's "when I speak," and it's my job.
Well, correct this.
I quit.
I don't need high school.
I'm gonna be a famous artist like Picasso or Ed Hardy or Vincent van...
- uh, van...
- Gogh.
I'm going!
God.
Come on, Venom, we're out of here.
Dude, did you not read the restraining order?
Stop talking to me, and change your clothes.
You're embarrassing an entire movement.
Cool.
I'll see you at the mall.
Please don't recognize me, please don't recognize me...
Rebecca Asher?
Drakkar Noir?
Present.
Great.
And I trust you remember Venom, Queen of the Night?
Now known as Venom, queen of the night shift at the Burger Barn.
Don't get any ideas.
I still have the restraining order.
Now we're gonna do a little math problem.
If Jimmy Chance dropped out of high school in 2005 and comes back in 2012 to get his G.E.D. diploma, how many years of his life has Jimmy Chance wasted?
Yes, Jimmy Chance?
- Seven?
- Wrong.
You won't know how many years of your life you wasted until your miserable life is over.
Now, going into geography.
If Jimmy Chance should die in a gutter, drowning in a puddle of his own sick, in the city of Santiago, what country would he be in?
Anyone?
Yes, Jimmy Chance?
I don't know the answer.
I was just wondering if you could stop using me as an example in all of your questions?
No.
The correct answer is "Chile."
All right.
Don't forget to read the first three chapters in your Earth Science book.
That would be chapters one, two, and three.
I'll see you all next week, except for Jimmy Chance, who I'm sure will quit by then.
Hey, how's the studying going?
Oh, not too good.
I'm thinking about asking Sabrina to help tutor me.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't do that.
Jimmy, girls like guys who are dumb and handsome, not really dumb and pleasant-looking.
And we have worked way too hard to keep Sabrina from finding out how stupid you are.
If she's helping you study, there's no way we're going to be able to bail you out.
You guys don't bail me out that much.
We bailed you out last week.
Hey, Jimmy.
Barney told me to tell you we're going to need capers.
Sure.
Capers.
Coming right up.
Yeah.
Burt, we got a word!
Damn it!
What's the word?
Capers.
"C" or a "K"?
Try "K," no... "C." It seems like a sneaky word.
Where'd everything on that shelf go?
I don't know.
Looks like there was a caper.
Hello?
It's a food.
It's a food!
We found another definition.
Why are there two definitions for one word?
Just make up new words!
"Mapers"... "flapers"... it's so easy to fix!
"Fronge," there's another word!
Look at that.
Uh, here are the pickled buds of the Mediterranean
Capparis spinosa bush you asked for.
Oh, thank you.
I hope I didn't confuse you before with my joke.
I thought for a second you were going crazy.
No, I just love a good wordplay.
You're a regular James Joyce.
Hello?
Burt!
James Joyce!
Damn it!
Okay, you guys bail me out a lot.
But the G.E.D. exam is about normal stuff like math.
And I know enough about that stuff to not embarrass myself in front of Sabrina.
Go ahead, ask me a basic math question.
Okay, okay...
Okay...
Oh, my God.
We're too stupid to even think of a question.
Maw Maw, come here and ask Jimmy a math question.
If the radius of a circle is six, what is the area?
A math question, Maw Maw.
That is math.
The formula is "pi r squared."
Is she even lucid right now?
Square pies...
I think there are squares in math.
But pies are round.
Cobbler's square.
Lemon squares are square.
Brownies are those long, thin squares.
Well, I could use something sweet, right now.
Anybody else hungry?
I could eat.
Burt, get out here.
There's a dog on TV that can bark dirty words.
What's that?
Ah... pillows.
Under the pillows.
Uh...
It's a little machine that makes a fart noise.
I was going to play a little trick on you later.
Make it make the noise.
Batteries must be dead on this thing.
What are you hiding under there?
That's one of Jimmy's smart books.
What is your game, mister?
I don't want Jimmy to get smarter than me.
Well, if you get smart, then I'll be the dumbest one.
And I'm not going from the "Moe" to the "Curly" in this trio.
Just put down the book and go watch TV.
And nothing smart.
No PBS and no NBC sitcoms.
Hey.
You guys aren't gonna believe this.
There is a "pi" in math.
It's a squiggly line held up by two little sticks.
What are you doing with my Science book?
I don't want Hope to think I'm the dumbest one in the house.
Fine.
We'll both get our G.E.D. diplomas, and Mom can be the dumb one.
Is that okay with you, Mom?
Hell no, it's not okay with me.
You guys get your G.E.D.'s, it'll be like the three blind mice, only two of them got their eyes fixed with that latex surgery and I'll be the only one bumping into things.
I want to get my G.E.D., too.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
If you're all educated,
I go back to being the dumbest one in the house again.
That's always gonna be the case, Jimmy.
Just like how the sky will always be blue because of the angle at which the solar illumination travels through the atmosphere.
Give me that damn book!
Good evening.
Mr. Swift teaches this class?
Do you think he'll remember us?
Ladies and Virginia, could you take your seats, please?
You're just jealous because people find my belly more interesting than your stupid quadradical equations.
I'm making a human bean!
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to prepare people for the future.
Unlike you and your idiot boyfriend here, some of these people still have a future.
Oh, we have a future.
I'm gonna be a stay-at-home mom, and Burt is gonna be a stay-at-home rock star.
And the last thing we're gonna need is your stupid math!
Smell you later, chump.
So, tonight we will be covering a wide range of...
Oh, I don't believe my eyes.
If it isn't the foul-mouthed, pregnant girl and the boy who thought it was hilarious to draw genitalia in my textbooks.
We've changed a lot since then.
How you doing?
If "X" equals "Y," then these two lines are...?
Burt?
Red.
True, but I was looking for "parallel."
This is a "right triangle."
What kind of triangle is this?
Wrong triangle.
Idiot.
Left triangle!
Can anyone tell me what happened in the Bay of Pigs?
There were no actual pigs involved.
It was becoming clear to us that if we were gonna get our G.E.D.'s, we were going to have to get some extra help outside of class.
So I decided to ask Sabrina for help, which meant confessing to her how stupid I really am.
Listen, don't beat yourself up just because as far as traditional education goes, you might not exactly be ahead of the curve.
I think it's "curb." "Ahead of the curb,"
because when you park, you don't want to hit the curb.
You want to stay ahead of it.
When's this test?
Next Tuesday.
We should start.
Dad went looking for Barney to help him but didn't know it was his day off, and caught Frank pretending to be the boss and interviewing for a large- breasted personal assistant.
In exchange for Dad not telling Barney or reporting him to the authorities, Frank agreed to help Dad study.
And Mom thought that if she could catch Maw Maw when she was lucid, she'd be the perfect tutor.
For the first time in our lives, we were all eager to learn.
So which one's heavier?
- Sand.
- Why?
Because the sand has a higher density than grass.
Great.
Now volume.
Because sand has a higher density than grass!
"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
"I do bite my thumb, sir."
Oh, this is boring!
Boring?
They're about to stab each other's lungs out with swords.
Does your copy have pictures?
'Cause mine just has a lot of words.
No, the pictures are in my head.
Oh...
I just keep picturing the words floating around.
Ah, there goes "thumb."
Well, don't do that.
That's really stupid.
Just picture the guys fighting.
Make a movie in your mind.
"Draw, if you be men."
Yeah!
I see 'em!
I see the guys!
They're wearing tights!
One of 'em's got a hat with a purple feather in it.
The other one looks like that detective from Roger Rabbit.
- Bob Hoskins.
- Yeah, yeah!
Keep reading.
"Gregory, remember thy swashing blow."
Ooh!
The Bob Hoskins guy just took a swing at the guy in the hat.
Oh, it is on now!
Oh, there goes the word "thumb" again.
Get out of here, thumb!

♪ When we threw away their tea and won the... ♪
♪ Revolutionary War in 1783
♪ It would've ended sooner if Nixon dropped the bomb ♪
♪ But it wasn't until 1973 that we got out of Vietnam. ♪
Eventually all the stuff they were trying to teach us kind of became fun, which I guess is why it started to stick in our heads.
So the centrifugal force is the one pushing you out, and the centripetal force is the one pushing you in.
I'm sorry it took me so long, but I think I get it.
"I am hurt.
"A plague o' both your houses!
I am spent."
See, by "houses," Shakespeare doesn't mean "buildings."
He means the two families.
They hate each other.
I don't know if you ever saw the soap opera Santa Barbara, but it's pretty much the same.
Excuse me.
Are one of you Frank Howdy?
I'm here to apply for the wiener-sampling job.
Just wait in my office.
I'll be right with you.

So we decided to put all our hardwork to a practice test.
It didn't matter who scored highest, but we were all going to laugh like hell at whoever scored lowest.
Well, one of you passed.
In your face!
It wasn't you.
Jimmy's dad, you let me down.
Not only as a tutor, but as a best friend.
Well, it's down to you and me now.
Virginia, you failed, too.
Virginia, you're grounded.
You've lost your cassette-player privileges.
Yes!
I'm the smartest.
Not quite.
You failed, too.
Hope was actually the only one that passed.
We graded the little answer sheet she was doodling on just for fun.
That kid's really starting to get on my nerves.
It's useless.
I'll never be smarter than Hope.
I can't believe we all studied, and we still got beat by a baby who filled in the dots randomly.
What if it wasn't random?
What if she's some kind of super genius?
Hope, what is 3.14?
Oh, my God, she knew the number for pi.
Or she's pointing out that we haven't fed her in seven hours while we were all busy failing this stupid practice test.
Either way, we're idiots.
I got a 90 in math.
That's out of 800, Mom.
That's a terrible score.
Oh.
That makes me feel less good about my 70 in English.
Well, you beat me.
I tanked everything except math and science.
I got a 500 in English.
I did pretty good.
I mean "pretty well."
Ugh!
That's probably another ten points right there.
Yeah, my science and history was a disaster.
A disaster like the great Chicago Fire?
Or Chamberlain giving up Poland to Hitler?
That's my fancy way of saying I did good in history.
Wait a second.
Oh, I think we're covered.
Dad, you remember that TV show you made me watch about the tough guy with the silver hair?
Maude?
No, it had people in a van, lot of running around...
-Action News?
-Scooby-Doo?
No, no, it had that theme song that went...
The A-Team.
Yeah!
On the A-Team each guy would have a different job on the caper.
- Caper!
- Caper!
Anyway, we could all be like Hope's learning A-Team.
I'll teach history;
you teach math.
- I call demolitions expert.
- Yes!
You're teaching English.
Oh.
You all right?
I guess.
I mean...
I'm happy we're gonna make this work out for Hope, but I hate giving Mr. Swift the satisfaction of knowing he was right about me quitting again.
Or... we can get the A-Team on it.
Yeah, Jimmy, it sounds like you have a problem no one else can solve.
We knew that none of us were capable of passing that test on our own.
We just needed to figure out how I could pass it.
The first section is math and science, which will be very important in your careers, whether it's making change or making meth.
Mr. Swift thought nobody could figure out a way to cheat on his test.
But he didn't realize that he was up against the A-Team of cheating.
This section is English.
Since each of us was good at one subject, if we just put the same name on the right answer sheet at the right time...
The next part is social studies.
...one person was gonna be good at all of them.
Well, it kills me to say it, but I was wrong.
You scored 90%.
Congratulations.
You've earned your G.E.D. diploma.
Which is amazing to me because you're the child of two morons who just posted the lowest score in the history of the G.E.D.
Well, what can I say?
Some of us are good at taking tests, some of us are good at raising smart children.
We can't all be good at everything.
Smell you later, chump.
At first I was worried that Hope was gonna think
I was a complete dummy.
But actually, I'm just part dummy like the rest of my family.
But altogether, we make a smarty, just like Hope.
I love it when a plan comes together.
Hey.
All right.
Who put the shapes in the sorter for Hope?
She's never going to learn if we keep doing it for her.
I didn't do it.
I've just been playing with this slinky for the past two hours.
Oh, my God, she's doing it on her own.
She can do the shape-sorter.
Good job, sweetie.
That's better than good.
That is amazing.
I mean, you were still struggling with that toy when you were four.
Virginia!
He's getting frustrated again.
Bring the sugar!
Stupid star!
You never really did have a knack for the shape-sorter.
We finally just took that toy away and gave you a bucket of checkers.
We said if you could just pick out one at a time, you win!
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
Ooh, I was awesome at Checker-Bucket.
How the hell do you open this thing?
Ah, you're such a good mom.
♪ Whoo!
♪ Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
♪
Ohh... cute.
What is she, about two?
Just about.
She play with the shape-sorter yet?
Not yet.
She gets frustrated.
My daughter's a whiz at it.
Have you tried making a Checker-Bucket?
It's where you put the checkers in, and let them take it out one at at a time.
It's good for the slower kids.
That's what my parents did for me.
Oh, they must be very proud.
Are you able to live on your own, sweetheart?
Not yet.
Well, someday.
Still annoying customers by bragging about your genius baby?
I'm not gonna argue with you.
It's good you're proud of her, and not threatened by her like my dad was.
Every time I'd answer more Jeopardy questions than him, he'd accuse me of sleeping with Alex Trebek.
It's a tough thing for a 12-year-old.
Well, I'm not threatened.
Besides, it's not like she's smarter than me.
- She's a baby.
- Well, not yet.
But if she's not even two and she's smarter than you were at four, then it's only a matter of time before she's smarter than you.
Do the math.
I can't do the math.
I can't do the math!
Okay.
I was four and she's two.
So, when she's four, I'll be eight.
No, wait a second.
That's not right.
Sucks, man.
I'm glad we never had to worry about a kid being smarter than us.
- Hey!
- No offense.
But we always knew you'd be dumb.
'Cause we're both dumb.
And that's how it works.
Your problem is, you made a baby with someone much smarter than you.
You really think Lucy was that much smarter than me?
She was a college graduate who avoided the police for years while she went on a murder spree.
You're a high school dropout who's been arrested five times for peeing in public.
So, yeah, I'd say she's much smarter than you.
Look, Jimmy, it's like the birds and the bees.
Two birds have a baby, they have a bird.
Two bees have a baby, they have a bee.
You're like a bee that had a baby with a bird.
Now the bird's gone.
And now you're a bee trying to raise a bird-bee.
Makes sense.
So how's a bee supposed to be able to raise a bird-bee?
I'm not smart enough for that.
And I don't know if I'm going to find another bird to marry.
She's going to have questions.
She's going to think I'm stupid.
This doesn't solve everything.
It is good, though.
What do they put in it to make it taste so sweet?
Hello.
Welcome to High School Equivalency Class.
"I don't know" is not an answer, Mr. Chance.
It's Drakkar Noir.
I hate this class.
I want to live in a classless society.
Okay, you're mixing up two different uses of the word "class."
Man, why do you always have to correct everything when I talk?
It's "when I speak," and it's my job.
Well, correct this.
I quit.
I don't need high school.
I'm gonna be a famous artist like Picasso or Ed Hardy or Vincent van...
- uh, van...
- Gogh.
I'm going!
God.
Come on, Venom, we're out of here.
Dude, did you not read the restraining order?
Stop talking to me, and change your clothes.
You're embarrassing an entire movement.
Cool.
I'll see you at the mall.
Please don't recognize me, please don't recognize me...
Rebecca Asher?
Drakkar Noir?
Present.
Great.
And I trust you remember Venom, Queen of the Night?
Now known as Venom, queen of the night shift at the Burger Barn.
Don't get any ideas.
I still have the restraining order.
Now we're gonna do a little math problem.
If Jimmy Chance dropped out of high school in 2005 and comes back in 2012 to get his G.E.D. diploma, how many years of his life has Jimmy Chance wasted?
Yes, Jimmy Chance?
- Seven?
- Wrong.
You won't know how many years of your life you wasted until your miserable life is over.
Now, going into geography.
If Jimmy Chance should die in a gutter, drowning in a puddle of his own sick, in the city of Santiago, what country would he be in?
Anyone?
Yes, Jimmy Chance?
I don't know the answer.
I was just wondering if you could stop using me as an example in all of your questions?
No.
The correct answer is "Chile."
All right.
Don't forget to read the first three chapters in your Earth Science book.
That would be chapters one, two, and three.
I'll see you all next week, except for Jimmy Chance, who I'm sure will quit by then.
Hey, how's the studying going?
Oh, not too good.
I'm thinking about asking Sabrina to help tutor me.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't do that.
Jimmy, girls like guys who are dumb and handsome, not really dumb and pleasant-looking.
And we have worked way too hard to keep Sabrina from finding out how stupid you are.
If she's helping you study, there's no way we're going to be able to bail you out.
You guys don't bail me out that much.
We bailed you out last week.
Hey, Jimmy.
Barney told me to tell you we're going to need capers.
Sure.
Capers.
Coming right up.
Yeah.
Burt, we got a word!
Damn it!
What's the word?
Capers.
"C" or a "K"?
Try "K," no... "C." It seems like a sneaky word.
Where'd everything on that shelf go?
I don't know.
Looks like there was a caper.
Hello?
It's a food.
It's a food!
We found another definition.
Why are there two definitions for one word?
Just make up new words!
"Mapers"... "flapers"... it's so easy to fix!
"Fronge," there's another word!
Look at that.
Uh, here are the pickled buds of the Mediterranean
Capparis spinosa bush you asked for.
Oh, thank you.
I hope I didn't confuse you before with my joke.
I thought for a second you were going crazy.
No, I just love a good wordplay.
You're a regular James Joyce.
Hello?
Burt!
James Joyce!
Damn it!
Okay, you guys bail me out a lot.
But the G.E.D. exam is about normal stuff like math.
And I know enough about that stuff to not embarrass myself in front of Sabrina.
Go ahead, ask me a basic math question.
Okay, okay...
Okay...
Oh, my God.
We're too stupid to even think of a question.
Maw Maw, come here and ask Jimmy a math question.
If the radius of a circle is six, what is the area?
A math question, Maw Maw.
That is math.
The formula is "pi r squared."
Is she even lucid right now?
Square pies...
I think there are squares in math.
But pies are round.
Cobbler's square.
Lemon squares are square.
Brownies are those long, thin squares.
Well, I could use something sweet, right now.
Anybody else hungry?
I could eat.
Burt, get out here.
There's a dog on TV that can bark dirty words.
What's that?
Ah... pillows.
Under the pillows.
Uh...
It's a little machine that makes a fart noise.
I was going to play a little trick on you later.
Make it make the noise.
Batteries must be dead on this thing.
What are you hiding under there?
That's one of Jimmy's smart books.
What is your game, mister?
I don't want Jimmy to get smarter than me.
Well, if you get smart, then I'll be the dumbest one.
And I'm not going from the "Moe" to the "Curly" in this trio.
Just put down the book and go watch TV.
And nothing smart.
No PBS and no NBC sitcoms.
Hey.
You guys aren't gonna believe this.
There is a "pi" in math.
It's a squiggly line held up by two little sticks.
What are you doing with my Science book?
I don't want Hope to think I'm the dumbest one in the house.
Fine.
We'll both get our G.E.D. diplomas, and Mom can be the dumb one.
Is that okay with you, Mom?
Hell no, it's not okay with me.
You guys get your G.E.D.'s, it'll be like the three blind mice, only two of them got their eyes fixed with that latex surgery and I'll be the only one bumping into things.
I want to get my G.E.D., too.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
If you're all educated,
I go back to being the dumbest one in the house again.
That's always gonna be the case, Jimmy.
Just like how the sky will always be blue because of the angle at which the solar illumination travels through the atmosphere.
Give me that damn book!
Good evening.
Mr. Swift teaches this class?
Do you think he'll remember us?
Ladies and Virginia, could you take your seats, please?
You're just jealous because people find my belly more interesting than your stupid quadradical equations.
I'm making a human bean!
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to prepare people for the future.
Unlike you and your idiot boyfriend here, some of these people still have a future.
Oh, we have a future.
I'm gonna be a stay-at-home mom, and Burt is gonna be a stay-at-home rock star.
And the last thing we're gonna need is your stupid math!
Smell you later, chump.
So, tonight we will be covering a wide range of...
Oh, I don't believe my eyes.
If it isn't the foul-mouthed, pregnant girl and the boy who thought it was hilarious to draw genitalia in my textbooks.
We've changed a lot since then.
How you doing?
If "X" equals "Y," then these two lines are...?
Burt?
Red.
True, but I was looking for "parallel."
This is a "right triangle."
What kind of triangle is this?
Wrong triangle.
Idiot.
Left triangle!
Can anyone tell me what happened in the Bay of Pigs?
There were no actual pigs involved.
It was becoming clear to us that if we were gonna get our G.E.D.'s, we were going to have to get some extra help outside of class.
So I decided to ask Sabrina for help, which meant confessing to her how stupid I really am.
Listen, don't beat yourself up just because as far as traditional education goes, you might not exactly be ahead of the curve.
I think it's "curb." "Ahead of the curb,"
because when you park, you don't want to hit the curb.
You want to stay ahead of it.
When's this test?
Next Tuesday.
We should start.
Dad went looking for Barney to help him but didn't know it was his day off, and caught Frank pretending to be the boss and interviewing for a large- breasted personal assistant.
In exchange for Dad not telling Barney or reporting him to the authorities, Frank agreed to help Dad study.
And Mom thought that if she could catch Maw Maw when she was lucid, she'd be the perfect tutor.
For the first time in our lives, we were all eager to learn.
So which one's heavier?
- Sand.
- Why?
Because the sand has a higher density than grass.
Great.
Now volume.
Because sand has a higher density than grass!
"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
"I do bite my thumb, sir."
Oh, this is boring!
Boring?
They're about to stab each other's lungs out with swords.
Does your copy have pictures?
'Cause mine just has a lot of words.
No, the pictures are in my head.
Oh...
I just keep picturing the words floating around.
Ah, there goes "thumb."
Well, don't do that.
That's really stupid.
Just picture the guys fighting.
Make a movie in your mind.
"Draw, if you be men."
Yeah!
I see 'em!
I see the guys!
They're wearing tights!
One of 'em's got a hat with a purple feather in it.
The other one looks like that detective from Roger Rabbit.
- Bob Hoskins.
- Yeah, yeah!
Keep reading.
"Gregory, remember thy swashing blow."
Ooh!
The Bob Hoskins guy just took a swing at the guy in the hat.
Oh, it is on now!
Oh, there goes the word "thumb" again.
Get out of here, thumb!

♪ When we threw away their tea and won the... ♪
♪ Revolutionary War in 1783

♪ But it wasn't until 1973 that we got out of Vietnam. ♪
Eventually all the stuff they were trying to teach us kind of became fun, which I guess is why it started to stick in our heads.
So the centrifugal force is the one pushing you out, and the centripetal force is the one pushing you in.
I'm sorry it took me so long, but I think I get it.
"I am hurt.
"A plague o' both your houses!
I am spent."
See, by "houses," Shakespeare doesn't mean "buildings."
He means the two families.
They hate each other.
I don't know if you ever saw the soap opera Santa Barbara, but it's pretty much the same.
Excuse me.
Are one of you Frank Howdy?
I'm here to apply for the wiener-sampling job.
Just wait in my office.
I'll be right with you.

So we decided to put all our hardwork to a practice test.
It didn't matter who scored highest, but we were all going to laugh like hell at whoever scored lowest.
Well, one of you passed.
In your face!
It wasn't you.
Jimmy's dad, you let me down.
Not only as a tutor, but as a best friend.
Well, it's down to you and me now.
Virginia, you failed, too.
Virginia, you're grounded.
You've lost your cassette-player privileges.
Yes!
I'm the smartest.
Not quite.
You failed, too.
Hope was actually the only one that passed.
We graded the little answer sheet she was doodling on just for fun.
That kid's really starting to get on my nerves.
It's useless.
I'll never be smarter than Hope.
I can't believe we all studied, and we still got beat by a baby who filled in the dots randomly.
What if it wasn't random?
What if she's some kind of super genius?
Hope, what is 3.14?
Oh, my God, she knew the number for pi.
Or she's pointing out that we haven't fed her in seven hours while we were all busy failing this stupid practice test.
Either way, we're idiots.
I got a 90 in math.
That's out of 800, Mom.
That's a terrible score.
Oh.
That makes me feel less good about my 70 in English.
Well, you beat me.
I tanked everything except math and science.
I got a 500 in English.
I did pretty good.
I mean "pretty well."
Ugh!
That's probably another ten points right there.
Yeah, my science and history was a disaster.
A disaster like the great Chicago Fire?
Or Chamberlain giving up Poland to Hitler?
That's my fancy way of saying I did good in history.
Wait a second.
Oh, I think we're covered.
Dad, you remember that TV show you made me watch about the tough guy with the silver hair?
Maude?
No, it had people in a van, lot of running around...
-Action News?
-Scooby-Doo?
No, no, it had that theme song that went... ♪ Drummy-drum-drum!
Then... ♪ Da-da-dah.
The A-Team.
Yeah!
On the A-Team each guy would have a different job on the caper.
- Caper!
- Caper!
Anyway, we could all be like Hope's learning A-Team.
I'll teach history;
you teach math.
- I call demolitions expert.
- Yes!
You're teaching English.
Oh.
You all right?
I guess.
I mean...
I'm happy we're gonna make this work out for Hope, but I hate giving Mr. Swift the satisfaction of knowing he was right about me quitting again.
Or... we can get the A-Team on it.
Yeah, Jimmy, it sounds like you have a problem no one else can solve.
We knew that none of us were capable of passing that test on our own.
We just needed to figure out how I could pass it.
The first section is math and science, which will be very important in your careers, whether it's making change or making meth.
Mr. Swift thought nobody could figure out a way to cheat on his test.
But he didn't realize that he was up against the A-Team of cheating.
This section is English.
Since each of us was good at one subject, if we just put the same name on the right answer sheet at the right time...
The next part is social studies.
...one person was gonna be good at all of them.
Well, it kills me to say it, but I was wrong.
You scored 90%.
Congratulations.
You've earned your G.E.D. diploma.
Which is amazing to me because you're the child of two morons who just posted the lowest score in the history of the G.E.D.
Well, what can I say?
Some of us are good at taking tests, some of us are good at raising smart children.
We can't all be good at everything.
Smell you later, chump.
At first I was worried that Hope was gonna think
I was a complete dummy.
But actually, I'm just part dummy like the rest of my family.
But altogether, we make a smarty, just like Hope.
I love it when a plan comes together.
THE DREAM AND THE SILENCE
"Never do anything like that again in front of me".
threatened Trud.
He took the sign on the bars.
looked inside the cage again.
which was completely silent.
and went home again through the park in complete darkness.
He'd gone down...
He'd left his book on the bench."
You see?
The youngest monkey is the one that wants to escape the most.
I thought it was this one.
We haven't read that part yet.
That comes later.
"When he got home..."
.This outfit?
.No.
You're not even looking, CeIia.
Yes.
I am.
I said no.
Good lord!
.This one?
.Neither.
You need a down jacket.
.I want one like paula's.
.They don't have it here.
.Not one like paula's.
.Why not?
Open your mind and look around.
.They're ugly.
.No, they're not.
Try them on.
Try one on and see how it looks.
Your heart is set on paula's.
you're being a pain.
It's twice as cool as all these together.
well, you're not getting paula's.
Don't even bother looking.
They're ugly and they're too puffy.
They make you look like a snowball.
Nobody wears a down jacket to look cool.
That one is awful.
The opposite.
The opposite.
Okay, here we go.
Let's start.
I'II ask the first question.
In Spanish, please.
Or raise your hand and ask in French.
.Is it small?
.No.
Okay.
Is it small?
No.
Who's next?
Is it tall?
Yes.
It's tail.
Okay.
small and taII.
More.
Is it short?
No.
It's tail.
What did you ask?
Is it short?
.No, fat or...
.Is it fat?
It's thin.
Good.
What else?
Is it an actor?
It's an actress.
Yes.
It's an actress.
An actress, okay.
An actress, what else?
Let's summarize.
An actress.
taII.
thin...
We're at home.
it's nighttime and we see animals coming out.
.Okay. .TaIking animals?
.That's up to you.
.I don't know.
.Okay. .They can talk.
And... when we see the animals coming out.
we see the kitten comes out last and wants to show us something.
.Fine. .Okay.
And...
I don't know.
That's all, they talk.
Okay.
Do they have powers?
No, better without.
.Just animals.
.NormaI but spies.
.Yeah. .Okay.
We should pick a few of them.
Two giraffes, two cats, two dogs.
No.
I mean we can pick three or four.
We can pick the cat. the dog.
the rabbit or the lion.
.AII of them.
.AII of them?
Yes.
.And one would be the cat.
.Okay.
The cat wants to tell us something.
Let's go see.
Let's go.
You see the animals?
How cool.
Sometimes it isn't easy to reinvent things.
But it's pretty easy in general.
.Easy?
.Yeah.
I find myself doing things my mom used to do and I prepare dishes I didn't like when I was a kid
and now I make lentils every week.
.For revenge?
.No. because I Iove them now.
And the girls do too.
.For their nutritional value.
.That's right.
No kid any where likes lentils.
.No. mine do.
.They're awful.
No. that depends.
Come over for lunch sometime.
No.
I Iike them.
But a child isn't aware of nutritional value.
But they're good.
If you make them right.
With a little chorizo.
They're not the same without chorizo.
With Iardons.
We make them with Iardons here.
If you take care of the presentation... .How?
.The presentation.
well.
lentils...
I don't know howto present them...
Me neither.
PIease. tell.
Not like in a school cafeteria' they throw it on the plate.
And it splatters.
.Have a good week.
.Thanks. Goodbye.
.Hi. Everything okay?
.Yes.
I'II be right with you.
I'm preparing a class.
Wait.
Let's see what he's prepared.
What?
.Let's see what he's prepared.
.Yeah.
We've talked about it a Iot.
I'II always remember it.
I'II always remember howyou were born.
Without the typical scream' without screaming your lungs out.
You were born swimming.
You were like this.
You looked completely calm.
After that they picked you up and when you were ready you started crying.
But after 30 seconds of magic.
well,magic...
If I'd seen you' I'd have told them to slap you.
.No,no.
.Shejust sat there.
No.
It was peaceful.
Because this one came out screaming.
"What lungs!".
I said.
And the other...
That's whyyou're such a good swimmer.
It looked like you were swimming.
Not you.
You came out,"Waaa!"
I'II park the car and be right in.
Park the car?
Okay.
Hi,sweetie.
Here,come in.
Come in,sweetie.
I couldn't wait to see you.
I couldn't wait to see you' my princess.
Even if it's onIyyou.
One is better than none.
Want to play cards?
I was playing to pass the time.
Do you know how?
You know' this one might be poisonous.
Water comes out when you pluck it.
And this flower?
It might be poisonous' my hand is sticky.
Does this flower prick?
No,that one doesn't.
Don't be so scared.
You're being a sissy,honey.
Like this,see?
Knowwhat we can play with this?
You've never played "He loves me,he loves me not?"
.That's with daisies.
.This one will do.
It has a Iot.
It has leaves.
You can play "He loves me', with it.
Because it has leaves.
Look at that baby pine tree.
When you come back in ten years' it will be bigger.
Did you see the different sizes?
It's very interesting to see.
Look at all the sizes.
small, medium...
This trunk has a Iot of kids!
Come on, sweetie.
There aren't manyfIies' but they're sticky.
They stick to your face.
Come on, hurry up.
We still have a way to go.
Do you Iike this smell?
It doesn't smell like anything.
Things are dry this time of year.
It hasn't rained in ages and everything is dry.
If it rained a IittIe' it wouId turn green.
But it hasn't rained.
So it's not green.
I've seen it very green.
But right now it's dry.
That part is green.
It's this color when it doesn't rain.
Come on, sweetie.
Keep going.
Watch out for that rock.
You almost tripped on that rock.
No, not that one.
.Take that one.
.Let me see.
This one is good.
Not this one.
It's burned on one side.
Don't be long, Jaume.
Say goodbye.
You know me.
You're not going to discover me now.
Have you gone to see ManeI about the wood?
.No, but I will.
.Oh, you will...
We're about to leave and the wood has to last all winter.
I'II do it, don't worry.
No...
I'm not worried, but...
I knowyou'II do it' but we might miss him.
Miss him?
He lives nearby.
I'II go in a second.
.You have to go, Jaume.
.I will.
You have to do it.
I'm not going to talk to ManeI.
I don't want you to.
I'II go.
I know, but get a move on.
Between your painting, your books and your computer...
Okay.
It's your life, but...
That's right.
It's my Iife.
I'm a little angry.
The kids are coming' you could spend time with them.
Listen, stop bothering me.
I knowyou don't like being bothered.
But I'm not happy.
well.
I'm sorry.
When they get here' you can go for a walk with them.
Okay, honey?
Go on.
I'II go see if they're here.
They should be here soon.
You're already suffering.
Wait a second.
I Iike stopping to do things I Iike.
Sure, and I don't...
What you Iike is never stopping.
They won't be long.
I'm going to clean up.
Good lord, this man, this man...
What am I going to do with him?
Daddy?
And your pills?
Daddy?
.I'm coming.
.She's calling you.
CeIia, we have a nicer tablecloth.
What?
We have a nicer tablecloth.
Here.
I'II give you a nicer one.
Great, really.
They couldn't wait to see her.
And her coming alone makes it even more fun' you know?
They get more time with her.
How about you?
How are things with alba?
I'II call you later.
Yeah.
I'II call you at dinnertime.
will you be home?
tell alba...
.Want to go to the bathroom?
.No, do you?
Want some water?
Water?
No, but I don't knowwhere to throw my gum away.
There's a wastebasket over there.
Come here.
Jaume.
shall I close the door?
close the door, Mom.
Don't close it.
You want to go outside?
Let them in.
I can't tell them not to come in.
I can't tell them not to come in.
Don't worry, nobody will come in.
You want some lime tea?
You don't want anything?
.No, thank you.
.HerbaI tea?
I'II be okay.
Did you tell Laura to stay outside with alba?
Did she leave?
I'II be fine later, but now...
Anyway...
Her mother doesn't want her to go in.
Does she want to?
No, she doesn't want to either.
She'II be okay.
I want one too, Jaume.
will you get me one?
I always keep one.
What a prettyfIower.
hold on to that one.
You can hang it and dry it out.
And keep it your whole life.
You hang it like this.
Okay, sweetie?
I hope Grandpa brings me one too.
You can hang it upside down so it dries out and you keep it.
Okay?
.We could never have imagined.
.No.
We'II keep it, that's what we'II do.
It's all we'II have, Jaume.
It's all we'II have.
.You like how it turned out?
.Yes.
Like this, or this one?
You try.
I'm going for a walk.
I'II stop by the hotel and get that for you.
That way tomorrow, when you go out' if you need to talk to the receptionist you'II have already learned.
Learned what?
To say, "Good morning' I want to have breakfast."
I already know howto say "good morning', and "good evening."
With that, you're halfway there.
I want more than that.
I want to go shopping and to the park and know what the girls are talking about.
AII right?
And OrioI?
What's he doing?
Working, he works tomorrow.
When are you going back to work?
I don't know, Mom.
Soon.
I think.
Soon.
Just a little longer.
Is alba at your school or have you changed her?
No, no.
We don't see each other' because she's in elementary, but...
But she's at the same school.
Convenient, right?
.Are you happy at school?
.Yes.
Look, this part isn't difficuIt' but you have to remember.
If you fold this one in' this one comes out.
You see?
Yes.
Like this?
Yes.
No, this goes inside.
To hold it together, see?
Inside.
And nowthat one comes out.
Does that one work?
I think it's empty.
Are there any more?
I think so, go and see.
I'II go see if there's more.
We've always tried to... to... to solve problems by talking about them.
And...
If we keep doing this' you can't move on and neither can I.
We never find the right moment.
You never feel like it.
could you go away?
please, OrioI.
This is as good a time as any to...
No.
Every day one of her classmates sits in her seat.
And they do it spontaneously.
We don't do that at home.
Excuse me?
At home we don't do that.
You don't do what?
There's a void.
I don't know if...
I'm sorry.
How am I supposed to come back to work?
How's OrioI?
In his world.
In his world.
I don't know.
.What's happening in his world?
.No idea.
.Has he recovered from his injuries?
.Yes.
Is he back?
.Is he at home with you?
.Yes.
He's doing okay.
He has no problems.
He's forgotten everything.
What has he forgotten?
He doesn't remember his daughter.
CeIia.
It's like... it makes it harder for me because it's like she...
like she wasn't a part of the family.
He doesn't...
I don't understand.
It's hard.
He doesn't remember the accident.
He has no memory of CeIia.
It's driving me crazy.
It's okayfor him.
It's his life.
It's his whole family.
His job.
.He's gone back to work?
.Yes.
He's fine.
What does he make of his injuries if he doesn't remember the accident?
We told him what happened.
I try to put myself in his place.
Imagine waking up one day in that state.
You're told you had an accident.
Do you hold it against him?
Yes.
For having the accident or for forgetting?
I don't know.
We don't speak very much.
What's your routine like?
I pretend nothing's wrong.
especially around AIba' so she won't be sad.
Around OrioI as weII' so he won't be sad.
Does he understand your grief?
I imagine.
I hope so.
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
I hope.
I guess.
You think something like that can be shared?
He woke up, so to speak.
He moved.
He's not in the mood.
He's old.
Where are the others?
That one's mocking the other one.
He's old, that's all.
The other one wants to play.
He's tired.
He's tired of playing along.
Look how he's looking at him.
And this one climbed this tree.
.He looks very relaxed.
.Yeah. Hejust climbed up.
It looks like he wanted to move a bit' but he wants nothing to do with the other one.
There's one over there.
.That's the oldest one.
.Yes.
He looks like the oldest one.
I'd even say he's the grandfather.
Let's see if there are more monkeys.
I want to see chimpanzees.
help her change clothes as well.
You know.
like it's a game.
We all change clothes together.
What about something more fun?
Besides changing clothes.
How about a movie?
How about a movie?
How about a movie.
I said.
A movie...
You mean a movie for us?
No, we could go with alba.
No?
I prefer seeing movies here at home' you knowthat.
Or your mom can babysit and you and I can go.
Maybe.
Going to a family movie...
We'd rather stay at home together.
But she misses out.
She needs to get out too.
.Whatever you want.
.No?
The four of us could go.
We could invite one of her friends.
.No. .No?
.I preferjust the four of us.
.Okay.
It would get my mother out of the house.
Then let's go out' but it doesn't have to be a movie.
Propose something.
Give me time to look into it.
There are some very interesting activites for children.
I'm sure we'II find something in one of these.
I'II look at it later.
I made one for you.
One second.
Go ahead.
It's very good' but it needs a little more light.
Yes.
I would add a little... color in here, some shade.
But it's very good.
.Shade?
.Yes.
Let me see.
With the opposite color, see?
A little shade.
This color is the opposite of yellow.
And this color is the opposite of red.
I never sit there.
.Not even to bring order?
.Never.
I can't see anyone from there.
.This chair is too low.
.I don't like it.
.You don't like it?
.Never.
It's the sturdiest chair in the school.
.I don't sit on it.
.Even to bring order?
No.
Here.
In any case...
Higher.
Do you want to be here?
I have to do it.
That's it.
It's something I have to do.
Otherwise...
Otherwise I can't move on.
You hear that noise?
.One of the kids.
.No.
A teacher walking back and forth.
What are you doing today?
Are you finished?
I'm finished.
I was waiting for you.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
.AII alone.
.Yeah.
I was waiting for you.
AII excited.
Me too.
.It's hard.
.I can imagine.
Jesus Christ.
You might be right.
We should stop doing this.
The photos can go straight to fucking hell.
I'II do it if you want' if it makes you feel better.
That's not the point, OrioI' for God's sake.
Who said looking at the photos would help?
I don't know...
Some people go to faith healers and they believe.
That's enough for them.
I don't know.
Force it...
I don't know, somehow.
You just seem so laid back.
The doctors say it will come back the way it left.
It's not therapy.
people made up that part about looking at the photos' but it's not a type of therapy.
Then what do we do?
Just let time pass?
Yes, but caImIy' without forcing it.
calmly, without forcing it.
Great.
Okay then.
We'II stay calm and not force it.
Our whole lives.
I don't know...
Even if you have to make an effort' at Ieast you get back... the routine.
You think I can get that back with you?
Are you helping?
Or do you make me...
Your routine before.
I was gone most of the day, so it's not Iike...
You have your...
I think you know down deep that you can go back to schooI' where you'II have more moments of...
Moments of glory.
That's what I need, moments of glory.
You need to get out of the house.
You have no idea.
You have no idea.
Get some air.
The yellow one is good.
If you don't want it, save it for me.
Which color do you Iike?
I Iike the pink ones.
I'II save them for you.
.Leave them for the end, okay?
.Okay.
I'II save you the pink ones and you save me the yellow ones.
Okay.
Very tasty.
I grabbed it and went like this:
I threw it, my sister ducked and the windowwent "crack."
And suddenly we hated each other and wanted to kill each other.
We stood there a second and then we hugged each other and were friends and sisters again.
And I said, "What will we tell Mom?"
"We can tell her you threw it at me..."
I don't knowwhat excuse we came up with' but we didn't dare come out of the bedroom.
And when we came out, "Mom?" "What?"
"Something happened in the bedroom." "What?
', But we were too scared.
We were ready to kill each other, but...
Nothing happened.
We made up some story' I don't remember what.
That one of us had tried to pass it to the other and threw it too hard and the window broke.
My motherjust stared at us like...
I remember that day very well.
We had a Iot offun together.
We played all the time.
With dolls, with Nancy... .She still exists.
.Remember Nancy?
She was chubby, not Iike nowadays' they make Barbies...
We had Barbie and Lucas.
.Lucas?
.Her boyfriend.
That's Ken.
Ken?
Then who is Lucas?
No, not Barbie...
We had Nancy and Lucas.
Lucas had dark hair and we had a blonde Barbie with long hair and a black one with hair like this.
We played with them a ton.
And we'd play in the street.
There was a huge sidewalk outside my building and all the kids would come down.
My building had three stories.
How many kids were there?
I don't know.
Eight or nine maybe.
We'd play...
I don't remember what it was called.
One kid would stand against the wall and another would put his head between his legs like this.
careful, stay still.
And we'd line up in a row with our heads between...
We were talking.
She asked me what I played when I was little.
I told her about when I used to fight with my sister and what we'd play outside my building.
She rested her head on the chair as she listened.
Then she drew lines on the ground with a rock...
That game.
I forget what it's called...
And wejumped and jumped with the rocks.
We had a great time.
She answered you?
You touched each other?
Of course.
Am I going crazy?
Maybe I am.
But I don't care.
It was great fun.
You have to go.
You might see her.
You go.
It's no problem for me.
I'd be happy to.
We were in the pIayground' by the swings.
How do you think I should react?
You'II recognize her when you see her and she'II see you.
She might be around there.
Promise you'II go?
I promise.
But are you okay?
.I'm great.
.You feel all right?
It was the nicest day I've had in weeks.
She looked beautiful.
well, believe me, for me...
Okay.
Grandpa, bring alba's suitcase.
You pretty thing.
The prettiest of all.
Pretty and beautiful.
Can you manage?
Okay.
Did you see what nice plants we have?
.Yes, they're very pretty.
.You like plants, huh?
I'm coming up.
It's chilly here.
Very chilly.
Very, very chilly.
This one goes here and alba's goes here.
I'II arrange the red one.
You know he got sick.
He wanted to have an operation to be on the waiting list for a kidney.
You knew about this more or less, right?
None of us wanted him to.
I'm telling you this so you'II see that life goes on and the grieffades a little.
When he said he wanted an operation we were all against it.
And my nephews said'
"You talk to him, he'II listen to you."
"Ramon, don't.
It's too risky..."
"I don't want to live like this, Laura."
I've been through drama like this before.
"I don't want to live like this.
I want to be on the waiting list for a kidney and if I manage to pull through'
I couId still enjoy life a little bit.
AII I ask, Laura' if something happens to me.
look after Nieves.
The boys have their lives and stuff, but as her sister.in.Iaw'
look after her, don't leave her alone."
That really hit me.
telling you about it' with everything eIse' with what happened to CeIia' it brings it all back.
But you reach a point where you can talk about it and even talk about it normaIIy' without crying.
That moment will come' even though you think it won't.
And with CeIia it'II be the same.
You'II see.
In a few days, not days, months' we'II be able to talk about her without all the pain we feel right now' without suffering like we are right now.
You don't believe it, but we will.
.We'd better.
.We will, you'II see.
.But you knowthat takes time.
.What?
You knowthat takes time.
.It'II pass, time will pass.
.Yeah, but...
That could take months.
Not one day, or two, or four.
It will take many days.
But it will go away.
I'm feeling it too.
obviously a brother isn't the same' I lost my mother' she was old it was the Iaw of nature.
Losing a brother with his whole life before him crushed me and I still am.
talking about it makes me upset at a time like this and it affects me more.
But sometimes I don't think about it and I'm all right.
The same will happen with CeIia.
You'II see.
Everything goes on' unfortunately everything wears off and we have to go through it together.
With OrioI and your mother' the four of us.
We have to take care of each other.
I don't knowwhat to say.
I don't knowwhat to say.
I know all this, Laura.
They're things you can't see coming.
.But you've been through this before.
.What?
.You've been through this before.
.But it's not the same.
Losing a brother isn't the same as losing a granddaughter.
I don't want to distract you telling you about my brother' but I'mjust saying so you knowthat with time...
You don't see it?
This goes over here.
The legs are too short.
.I think it's okay.
.A little weird.
.What's wrong?
.The legs are too short.
Let me see yours.
It's as pretty as a postcard.
I feel like giving her a hug.
It's very sensual.
look.
A necklace?
Very nice!
Good lord.
You need to shine the broach.
Wash it off.
Grandma, those things look IikejeIIy!
.CouId you do it?
.Sure.
I was playing with CeIia until they left.
A little before.
I can't stop thinking about it.
But I don't know.
I'II take you if you want, but...
I need to go there.
It's an absurd place.
I don't know how it could have happened.
I don't understand.
Something stupid.
Can you take me?
Of course I can.
Whenever you want.
This is where it happened.
I'm exhausted... .Are you going to read?
.A little.
until I faII asleep.
I'm on an interesting page.
Something crazy happened to me today.
What?
So things were really tense between us.
I Ieft Morocco, we weren't talking.
It was awful.
After that, things calmed down.
We wrote to each other, we spoke.
Things went back to normal.
It was tense.
It wasn't very positive.
But it was good that it was the Iast time we saw each other.
I didn't know at the time, but I never saw my adoptive father again.
That's right.
It was a big surprise for him too.
I remember when we got out of the taxi with my older brother' my mother heard a car parking.
She came out' she knew he was coming...
She saw him get out of the taxi and open the trunk...
It was dark.
It was at night.
It was around 10 PM.
She saw me get out after him...
My mother was wearing gIasses' she's myopic.
So she was trying to see us in the dark...
After she said all she could see was a big ball of hair and she didn't knowwho it was.
So that's it.
So I went into my adoptive father's bedroom.
He was Iying on the bed...
He was ill?
He's been ill for years.
He was ill without being ill.
It's been years.
I don't know.
16 years.
He was going through a depression.
He was Iying on his bed, sitting up... stretched out...
My other father, my dad' was sitting on the edge of the bed...
He was right next to him.
I walked in and they both looked at me.
They all wear glasses.
They all turned and looked at me... .So it was nice?
.Yes.
I rushed into his arms' then into the other's...
It was very nice.
From those 48 hours' that's the scene that stays with me.
It's like...
Together.
Everybody together.
let's go.
How many candles are there?
.Four. .Ten.
"To go."
Gone.
Okay?
We'II learn irregular verbs after.
But the regular endings are:
"ed', and "led."
The verb "to study."
ParticipIe?
"Studied."
We take off the "y', and... ."Studed." .No.
"Studied."
"Studied.', Okay?
Let's see...
GuiIIaume.
Past tense of the verb "to study."
We're still having trouble contacting the mom for an interview.
Any help there?
Jackie?
Sure.
She's probably circling the building.
- No, Alicia's mom.
- Oh.
That might prove a little more difficult.
- Let me check.
- Good.
Now, Will Gardner, Alicia's boss,
I still want to interview him.
Okay.
How about Diane Lockhart?
- We'd prefer Mr. Gardner.
- Why?
They went to Georgetown together.
I'll see what I can do.
Is there anything else, Mandy?
An interview with Alicia wouldn't hurt.
(laughs)
It seems this cover story is more about Alicia than Peter.
No, we've just had greater access to Peter.
Ah.

Am I being sandbagged?
Define sandbagged.
- Is this a hit piece?
- No.
It is an objective profile of your candidate...
Come on, Mandy, you still want something from me.
- What's going on?
- Get me face time with Alicia Florrick.
Tell me what's up first.
I have solid information of an affair.
Solid information?
What?
From the checkout line?
Eli, you asked, so I told.
Get me some face time with Alicia.
(sighs)
When do you go to press?
This week.
(line ringing)
Come on, Alicia, come on.
This is Alicia Florrick.
Please... (phone beeps off)
ALICIA:
So, if I went looking for your voice recognition software...
WOMAN:
Our name would be at the top.
ALICIA:
And this is a search engine result from last year...
June 2011.
That's your software?
Margarita Motions?
Yes.
Julie and mine.
We named it after our moms.
Margaret and Rita.
Gizmodo considered it the top voice recognition software in the country, and you resisted being bought out by Apple and Microsoft.
Yes, we wanted to do it on our own, like our hero,
- Neil Gross.
- And what happened after June 2011?
We dropped.
Overnight, we dropped.
Now you have to flip through 28 pages of search results to find us.
And if I were to look for your software
- by using your name... ?
- Try it.
Type it in.
"Do you want Margarita Mixes?"
It always corrects that way.
And you say this happened overnight?
Yes, it did.
June 13, 2011.
And why do you know that date so specifically?
Well, a week earlier, we were approached by a sales rep from Chumhum,
Mr. Gross's company.
They wanted us to buy ads for the search engine, and we said no; we wanted to save the money for hiring.
And then a week later, you dropped to page 28 in their results?
- Yes.
- And that's why you're suing for unfair trade practices?
Yes.
The problem is, if the search engine doesn't acknowledge you, you don't exist.
We went bankrupt.
We lost our money, our parents' money, our friends' money.
We read your book...
Mr. Gross, we went to the same college.
- We're just trying to do what you did.
- Objection, Your Honor.
Please ask the witness to refrain from addressing my client.
Would you like me to ask her to not look at him, too?
Okay, do I have to separate you two?
Can you please speak up?
Nothing further, Your Honor.
LAWYER:
Ms. Sun... let me read you a review by the tech blogger
UberTech, posted two days before your search engine drop.
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized.
It stinks."
Don't you think your search engine drop was due to the negative reviews?
A drop isn't based on the quality of a product.
- It's based on how many people link to it.
- Yes.
But didn't, a week earlier, competing software,
Wicked Savage Designs, go on sale?
- And isn't it more popular?
- It is now.
Isn't it at the top of all voice-recognition searches?
Yes, but Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
JUDGE MARX:
What?
I said, Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
(elevator bell dings)
Well, here we are again.
- Good to see you, Mr. Gross.
- This is harassment, pure and simple.
I don't think you've met our newest associate,
- Cary Agos.
- Well, some people create,
- others destroy.
- Yup, I'll write that down.
Wait here, please.
We'll be right back.
They got the whole team.
I'll go get Julie and Elizabeth?
Good.
I want him to negotiate while our clients are staring right at him.
(indistinct, overlapping chatter)
Uh, hello?
Is that him?
!
Is that the bastard?
How many drinks does it take?
!
How many?
!
You rented out our conference room?
In my capacity as trustee, supervising the restructuring of Lockhart-Gardner, and taking upon myself the task of seeking other cash-flow opportunities...
Mr. Hayden, we need our conference room.
It's for three days.
They're paying $8,765.
We're in the middle of a million-dollar negotiation.
Where do you want me to do it... in the bathroom?
Out of respect for his fellow alums, and without admitting fault...
MAN:
You bitch!
You stupid bitch!
Um...
Mr. Gross is offering $123,000 to help defray Julie and Elizabeth's
- initial start-up costs. - It's odd, you're not smiling.
Usually when people joke, they smile.
You turn this down, ladies, and you'll see what deep pockets can do.
CARY:
Why don't you refrain from speaking to our clients, Mr. Gross?
Why don't you tell them the truth... that you have no leverage here.
Leverage belongs to whomever can outlast.
And money outlasts.
We take this money, we can start over.
ELIZABETH:
It doesn't even begin to address what we lost.
JULIE:
He won't pay more.
You heard him.
- We have no leverage here.
- WILL:
Julie, give us a day.
If we don't have leverage by then, take the offer.
WOMAN:
You're the trustee, right?
Yes.
And you are... ?
Oh, I'm Viola Walsh.
I'm the defendant in your current suit.
Unfair trade practices.
May I help you?
You may.
We're gonna fight this to the last breath.
Your team is working on contingency.
And you don't fight Waterloo on contingency.
Now, I know that Will Gardner likes to battle with his ego, but I hope more dispassionate minds can rule.
Ms. Walsh, you have to negotiate with Mr. Gardner, not me.
You're watching out for the creditors, sir.
Will isn't.
And I don't think the creditors are going to be happy when you throw good work after bad.
I'm offering cash.
How much?
MAN:
And that's how a search works.
Our software is like a gopher, but a really fast gopher.
(chittering) (laughs)
It races through an index of billions of billions of Web pages all connected in a web of links.
We call this gopher, Chummie.
After Chummie finds all the pages connected to your search...
May I interrupt here?
Yes, Your Honor, of course.
Is it... is it loud enough?
Is this necessary?
Isn't it just trying to explain a template-based link analysis algorithm?
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- Okay.
Then we can turn it off.
There's no jury.
Just me.
VIOLA:
Of course, Your Honor.
My apologies.
So there's no link between ad sales and search engine results?
That is correct.
Even if I wanted to impact the results,
I couldn't.
The algorithm acts on its own.
We don't touch it.
VIOLA:
Thank you, Mr. Gross.
Why are you shaking your head, Mr. Gross?
GROSS:
I don't know.
The usual reasons.
Disbelief, incredulity, disappointment.
Ah.
I must be endangering the future.
No, just being a bit melodramatic.
So you never tweak the algorithm?
Chummie, the squirrel, just acts on his own?
No, I didn't say that.
But you said you couldn't impact the results.
Yes.
But the algorithm needs almost daily attention and revision.
I see.
And why would you revise it?
(scoffs) Well, for one thing, to avoid spam.
Spammers are constantly trying to game the search results.
We adapt the algorithm to avoid that.
Ah, so the quality of the Web page is taken into account in the algorithm?
Well, uh, uh, those are your words, but yes.
And that quality is determined on an almost-daily basis?
You said, "tweak the algorithm daily."
Yes.
Did you tweak the algorithm on June 13, 2011?
I have no idea.
But you said "almost daily," so probably?
I have no idea.
You have no idea whether the algorithm was tweaked on June 13, 2011, the day our clients' software dropped from page one on your search engine results to page 28?
That is correct.
Then, Your Honor, we subpoena Chumhum for records on their algorithm.
Your Honor, excuse me.
No.
The algorithm is the key to Chumhum's success.
It's their secret sauce.
If you expose the algorithm, you expose a trade secret.
So?
The defendant has admitted to changing the algorithm based on quality, which is the exact subject of this suit.
Your Honor, I just...
And the only way to determine whether the defendant's claims are true is to subpoena the evidence.
The best evidence rule applies here, Your Honor.
Your Honor, the plaintiff knows that we will never reveal the algorithm.
He is just using the court authority so that he can force us into a settlement.
The difficulty I see, Ms. Walsh, is that an attribute-based linked analysis is not a closed system.
Therefore, it is subject to manipulation.
So I am prone to order such a subpoena.
We ask for 24 hours
- to prepare our arguments.
- Sorry, I couldn't hear that.
(louder):
We ask for 24 hours to prepare.
(gavel bangs)
Remember when I used to sleep on your couch?
Eli.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm missing a speech to the National Council of La Raza.
- How about you?
- Working.
Do you mind closing the door?
What do you need, Eli?
We've never talked about this.
In fact, I've deliberately avoided talking about it.
By "it," you mean... ?
You and Will.
Just so you know, I'd rather be doing anything else.
Okay.
Mandy Post, the reporter, wants to talk to you about your... affair.
Her word.
I pushed Mandy.
She seems to have a copy of a hotel receipt for a September 30, 2011... encounter... and I need to know if that timing makes sense.
I don't know.
There is a chance this all could be a bluff.
But do you have any way of checking if you were... if there was a hotel stay?
Is she going to press with this?
She hopes to.
- And I hope to stop her.
- Can you?
I don't know.
She likes to think of herself as a responsible journalist.
The good news is, responsible journalists are the easiest to co-opt.
Are you still seeing him?
Let me put it this way:
if you are still seeing... (quietly):
Will... you need to stop.
For a time.
This magazine has been known to follow people.
I'm not seeing him.
Good.
Can I ask you when this stopped?
No.
(door opens)
(phones ringing, indistinct chatter)
(sighs)
(panting)
(phone vibrates)
- Yeah?
- ELI:
It's me.
Where are you?
Don't you come to work anymore?
What do you need, Eli?
Your help.
And first of all, let me say it's not what you think... it's only tangentially about the campaign.
I'm not helping Peter.
ELI:
It's not about... (phone beeps off)
Who's Peter?
Someone.
You have a lot of someones in your life.
Yeah.
I want one of your omelets.
Hey, Bill wants to come over.
To say hi.
You know, he doesn't blame you anymore.
He's getting the cast off, and...
I was just thinking that... (sighs) right.
So that's how we're gonna play it, is it?
How's that?
Yeah, that's better.
(drops knife to counter)
You know, you have a strange idea... of how things work now.
I'm the husband and you're the wife.
Yeah.
And this isn't your home anymore.
Clean it up.
(door opens)
(door closes)
Thomas Giles.
I work as a search engine optimizer.
- And what is that?
- Ms. Walsh,
I know what a search engine optimizer is.
(chuckles):
Thank you, Your Honor.
Of course.
When you offer your services, Mr. Giles,
- what is it that you guarantee?
- To get my clients
- onto the first page of a Chumhum search engine result.
- I see.
And did the plaintiffs hire you to do...
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.
This is a preliminary hearing to discuss
- the subpoena of Chumhum's algorithm.
- Yes, but the question of damages must be established before the question of a subpoena.
How many witnesses do you intend?
To establish the absence of damages?
Two.
I will allow.
And did the plaintiffs hire you to get their product on the first page of a Chumhum search?
Yes.
In other words, the plaintiffs hired you to "game" the system.
Objection!
And the Chumhum algorithm just countered that gaming...
Objection.
- Overruled.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
Miss Holmes, where do you work?
In Chumhum's advertising department.
You're the evil advertiser who approached the plaintiffs about an online ad?
HOLMES:
Well, I hope not evil, but yes.
- And they turned you down.
- Yes.
- Unfortunately, it happens.
- So you immediately told Mr. Gross, so that he could meddle with the algorithm and get back at them?
- No.
- You didn't?
Really?
Because that just seems like the sensible next step.
- CARY:
Objection.
- Withdrawn.
- What did you do next, Miss Holmes?
- Well,
- after they said no, I went on vacation.
- You did?
- For how long?
- Two weeks.
And did you tell anyone at Chumhum about the plaintiff's
- ad rejection?
- Before vacation?
No.
It was bad news.
I usually hold off on bad news.
- So, just so I'm clear, you never told anyone...
- I get it, Ms. Walsh.
Any change in the algorithm couldn't have come from the advertising department because Miss Holmes was on vacation.
- Do you have any documentation to that effect?
- Of course, Your Honor.
(elevator bell dings)
- You're on it?
- Yeah.
How long have I got?
We're back in court tomorrow.
There's got to be someone this advertising rep told before her vacation.
We got this?
Were we together on September 30 last year?
Together?
- I don't know.
- Why?
At a hotel?
Maybe.
I don't know.
But you paid.
I don't remember,
- was it that hotel downtown, the Fairmont?
- I can look.
Thanks.
Mandy Post says she has a copy of the receipt.
I don't see how she could.
Well, Eli needs something to... refute her.
She's gonna print it?
Eli's having a meeting with her tonight to convince her not to.
I'll look right away.
You okay?
I don't know.
I feel cursed.
(door closes)
Will...
I like you, and that's why I'm giving you a chance to save face.
We're upping our offer 20%.
MAN (in distance):
You want a divorce?
!
You got it!
We want this over.
We're offering $160,000.
(giggling)
Will, I know that your ego is invested in this, but I hope that more dispassionate minds rule.
Oh, no, what do you have for us now?
You were right... it wasn't about the advertising; that's not why you messed with the algorithm.
- Then why are we still talking?
- You messed with the algorithm because Mr. Gross secretly bought out
Wicked Savage Designs.
He bought the top competing voice-recognition software, and a week later, Margarita dropped on his search engine, and Wicked Savage climbed.
CARY:
We're presenting it in court tomorrow unless you come up with a real offer.
Well, that was satisfying.
Sometimes the stars align.
(door slams)
What are you doing?
Talking to Viola.
- Ms. Walsh?
Yes.
- We're in negotiations with her!
Calm down, Ms. Lockhart.
No.
You don't sabotage Will.
- How am I sabotaging?
- By talking to her.
Is she saying Will is a problematic negotiator and you need to step in?
Is she lowballing you?
- Yes, of course she is!
- I'll go to the judge...
I will get you replaced for sabotaging our negotiations, I swear!
I am helping you!
Of course she's lowballing me.
I'm not dumb.
I'm getting her offer up.
Why do you think she added 20%?
She thinks she's pulling me on to her side.
But she's not?
Ms. Lockhart...
I work for the firm.
Yes, I have the power to veto you and Mr. Gardner, but your success... is my success.
You have been paranoid for so long, you don't recognize when someone is on your side.
No.
Actually, I'm waiting for a call.
- I'm just gonna call about homework.
- Eli is calling this number, and I don't want to miss it.
- I'll get the call waiting.
- Grace, I said no.
In ten minutes.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
- Alicia?
- Yeah.
Eli?
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.
I'm here with Mandy, talking over the story.
Yeah.
You're in the clear.
(inhales)
How?
She got the date wrong?
No.
It's, uh... i... it's not about you.
Don't worry.
Eli, thank you.
I...
Thank you.
Okay, I gotta go.
Take care. (click)
(sighs with relief)
ZACH:
Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
- GRACE:
Can I have the phone now?
"May I have the phone now?"
May I?
I love you.
I love you, too.
- You all right?
- (whispers):
Yeah.
Oh, actually, I do need the phone, just for one minute.
Now?
Yeah, I left my cell phone at work.
(phone ringing)
(beep)
Alicia, hi.
How are you?
Okay.
(laughs softly)
We're okay.
You talked to Eli?
Just now.
It wasn't about us.
Good.
Who's it about?
Um... (clears throat) I've gotta go.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling, Alicia.
You're welcome.
(phone keypad beeping)
(line ringing)
ELI:
You've reached the voice mail of Eli Gold.
(phone beeps off)
Zach, Grace, I'm going to go out for a few minutes.
(elevator bell dings)
Alicia, hey.
Everything all right?
I don't know, Eli, is it?
(sighs)
Mandy.
You said it wasn't about us, so who's it about?
(sighs) Alicia.
Eli, it's going to come out anyway.
It's, it's a lie, it's gossip, the same as when we thought it was you and Will.
I'm gonna make this easy.
There's a rumor of Peter sleeping with someone last year.
Mandy has a hotel receipt?
We were separated, Eli.
Just tell me.
I'm just getting to the bottom of this now.
And I haven't told Peter.
Supposedly it's a campaign worker, but it's pure fiction.
Alicia... this is politics.
Peter is vulnerable in this, and that is why it's being used.
What's wrong?
Nothing. (phone rings)
I have to go.
You know, you did call me.
I know.
Tomorrow night?
(scoffs)
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Lana, I really have to go.
Kalinda, you come here, and I feel like I'm warming you up for someone else.
You're not.
Hey.
Hi.
You seem good.
I'm excited about the case.
Uh, Your Honor, before we begin, I believe there's still a question of standing.
No, Your Honor, there's no question of standing.
There is a question of Chumhum's purchase of Wicked Savage.
Yes, but first there is a question of standing being raised by Chancellor Carlyle.
- Who?
- MAN:
Your Honor, I am the chancellor of Chicago Polytechnic.
I'm happy for you.
Now, what do you want?
I'm here to assert the university's ownership of the software titled Margarita Motions.
What?
!
If I could point to page 42 of the university's student handbook:
"The college owns the right to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries created by employees or students... "
You're kidding... we invented this.
Yes, but on school property and using school resources.
There is a legal precedent here,
Your Honor.
Google was forced to negotiate with Stanford over the rights to Google, and the University of Illinois sued one of the cofounders of Netscape for trademark infringement.
Therefore, we ask that the subpoena be quashed, given that the plaintiffs' standing here is unclear.
Just give me a listen.
Uh, I'm on a case, Eli.
It's for Alicia, not Peter.
Look, Peter is being accused of sleeping with a campaign worker, and he didn't.
I'm just trying to stop the story before it embarrasses Alicia.
- Embarrasses Alicia?
- Yes.
After all she's been through, you know it will.
Just listen to the reporter's questions, that's all.
This is Kalinda, my assistant.
I asked her to sit in.
Hi.
Really?
I thought we were finishing up.
Oh, no, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
If you want face time with Peter and Alicia,
I'll need to know what you're going to ask.
His assistant, huh?
(sighs)
Peter Florrick and one of his campaign workers slept together on September 30.
Where?
Eli, we vetted this.
Then what's your worry?
(sighs)
The St. Martin.
Was she visiting him or he visiting her?
They were both there.
Campaign workers on one floor,
- Peter on another.
- And which room did they go to?
They had a prearranged signal.
She was to go to his floor at 11:30 and knock on his door.
KALINDA:
On how many occasions?
What's her name?
No.
ELI:
Mandy, if it's true...
And if I tell you, you'll have no reason to buy the magazine.
Get me face time.
Eli told me.
Peter, let's not do this, please.
It's not true;
I wanted you to know.
Seriously, Peter, I have had a very long day, and by the end of the week,
I will have had a very long week.
Look, I have a target on my back, and this is not true.
Do you remember what you said the first time?
"It's not true."
And that's exactly why they're throwing this crap at me... because my denials will look like lies.
It's politics.
The problem is, Peter, I don't give a damn.
WILL:
Good morning, Chancellor.
What's this, Chancellor?
It's my book... a book I wrote about ways to improve education in America.
And what income did you derive from this book?
In royalties?
I... well, I don't have the facts and figures at my fingertips.
I do, actually.
$71,450, mostly due to students being required to buy it as a textbook.
Now, how much of that money went to the college?
CARLYLE:
How much?
You mean, of the royalties?
I don't know.
Did any portion go to the college?
I... no.
But you're a college employee, aren't you, sir?
And the student handbook here clearly states,
"College owns the rights to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries created by employees and students."
Yes, but that's not a fair comparison.
I'm the university chancellor.
So the rules don't apply to you?
No, that's not what I said.
The college is selective in how it enforces its rules?
Oh, come on.
There is a radical difference between $71,000 in royalties and the potential millions from the plaintiffs' voice recognition software.
Yes, thank you for prompting the good chancellor in how to answer my question, but...
Objection, Your Honor.
I find this line of question offensive and irrelevant.
No, it isn't, Ms. Walsh; it actually isn't.
Please continue, Counselor.
WILL:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Is Mr. Neil Gross a graduate of your university?
He is an honored graduate.
And did you know that his company Chumhum is worth $86 billion?
Well, even if you didn't know that, you knew that he'd given a $50 million endowment to the university.
- Yes.
- So... have you claimed ownership of Chumhum?
No.
Really?
But you read in his book that he created his page-ranking hierarchy in your computer lab.
MARX:
Okay, that's enough.
I'm ready to rule on standing.
It is my determination that, due to estoppel by silence and my general disgust with the chancellor's tactics...
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.
This is my court; you may go now.
Thank you.
The college has no standing here, and the interests of the plaintiff" suit holds sway.
Yes!
Yes!
I also find that Mr. Gross will open all pertinent aspects of his algorithm
- to scrutiny...
- Your Honor, we cannot allow
- the algorithm, as you know...
- Yes, you can.
Ms. Walsh, what you cannot do is hide behind the skirts of trade secrets indefinitely.
I will appoint a third party to peruse all algorithm documents, in order to avoid competitive leaking.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes.
I know what you're doing.
Your firm's bankrupt.
You lost my competitor, Patric Edelstein, so you're looking for another big fish.
You know I have a tendency to buy out my irritants, hire firms who sue me, so this... just a little performance piece.
Well, not to toot our own horn, Mr. Gross, but there is strategic advantage in hiring the firm that used to represent your competition.
Although we're legally bound by attorney-client privilege, we know how Mr. Edelstein works and we know how to beat him.
You're right... strategically smart... but, you see, here's the thing:
I don't like you and I intend to go out of my way to never hire you.
Nice talking with you.
Look, Mr. Gross, little advice:
If you're looking for a good lawyer, don't go with who you like.
If I can irritate you like this, just think what I can do to your enemies.
I'm rich enough not to care.
ELI:
There were 12 campaign workers at the St. Martin, ten of them female.
Who's that?
Indira Starr, advance.
And she was at the hotel?
Yeah, why?
Kalinda, it is not true.
Peter did not sleep with her.
(door opens) PETER:
Eli...
I want you to look at this speech...
Hi, Peter.
ELI:
Peter, you know Kalinda Sharma?
Yes, in the State's Attorney's Office.
- Of course, yeah.
- She's helping us with, uh, Mandy Post.
Excuse me.
Uh, you want the photo?
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.
Sure.
(door closes)
You have her on this?
Yeah, Why?
She wants to be on it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
What do I need to know here, Peter?
(sighs)
Nothing.
Let's go over this.
VIOLA:
You're reluctant to reveal the Chumhum algorithm to the court.
Why is that?
Well, for the obvious reason, it's our crown jewels.
Other companies would pay millions for access to it.
VIOLA:
And you're here to tell the court that you won't acquiesce to their subpoena,
- is that right?
- Yes, but I believe
I have the law on my side.
VIOLA:
Why is that?
- The First Amendment.
- WILL:
Oh, dear God.
JUDGE MARX:
Mr. Gardner.
Please.
Our search engine results are protected by free speech.
To compel their release is the same as compelling a newspaper to reveal its sources.
(Will chuckling)
VIOLA:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Therefore, you have editorial discretion, Mr. Gross?
Yes, and that is why I am resisting this subpoena.
Hey.
Hey.
- Kalinda, hello.
- NICK:
Hey.
This must be your friend.
Kalinda is it?
How are you doing?
I'm Nick.
He was just keeping me company.
Thrilling me with his accent.
Oh, I was trying to.
So how do you two know each other?
- Just friends.
- Really?
You seem like more.
Well, I don't know.
You seem like, uh, adopted sisters or something.
No.
Friends from way back.
Let me get you both a drink.
Friends.
Sure.
Oh, I've just got something through.
Sorry.
Will you excuse me, please?
I'm just gonna be one second.
Dyke.
Kevin Costas.
I'm a blogger.
My blog, UberTech, was awarded one of the Top 25 Tech Blogs of 2010 by Engadget.
Congratulations.
And on your blog you wrote:
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized... it stinks."
Yes.
And how do you know it was plagiarized?
KEVIN:
How do I know the software was?
Because it was.
'Cause it's not very good.
And you have proof they stole it?
You mean, actual proof?
No.
But I don't need it.
It's my opinion.
VIOLA:
Objection, Your Honor.
What does this have to do with the lawsuit?
ALICIA:
Mr. Gross is claiming editorial discretion for his search engine, therefore he is responsible for its editorial content...
- Wait a minute...
- They can't have their cake and eat it too, Your Honor.
If they insist on free speech protections, then they're responsible for that speech.
Your Honor...
No, Ms. Walsh, she's right.
Overruled.
So, Mr. Costas, you printed the accusation of plagiarism without checking truth or falsehood?
I didn't need to.
And did Mr. Gross, or anyone from Chumhum, ask you for evidence as to the truth of your accusation?
Uh... from Chumhum?
Uh, no.
Judge, this is absurd.
Chumhum has millions of pages.
If my client is gonna be held liable for every single one...
Well, then there will be a hell of a lot
- of defamation suits.
- Yes, Ms. Walsh.
I'm not making a free speech argument.
You are.
(sighs)
One million dollars.
But you have to take it now.
No consulting with Will.
No second guessing.
Just business between two like minds.
No.
- We're not going higher.
- That's probably true.
(sighs)
It's one million dollars.
This firm is bankrupt.
Then negotiate with Will.
Tell him.
But I'll advise him not to take it.
Why?
I've seen the evidence.
- You're a businessman.
- Yes.
Show a businessman a winning hand, he doesn't need to be a gambler to go all in.
I'm going all in.
Will has gotten to you.
He's put dollar signs in your eyes.
I'm trying to be the peacemaker here.
(laughs)
Why aren't people just upfront with what they want?
Why don't they ever just say what they mean?
Well, you have chosen a really strange time to get philosophical.
No.
It's the perfect time.
Thank you.
At first I was just... you know, flirtatious.
Older guys like to flirt with me.
- I have a nice laugh.
- And then you two had sex?
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.
I told that reporter, it's not like I'm some Rielle Hunter.
How many times did you have sex?
Maybe eight times.
I don't know.
Was it always at a hotel?
No, uh, twice at his apartment.
Once, we were doing it in the bedroom and we heard his wife coming home.
Yeah, it was like something out of a movie.
I had to hide in the bathroom.
She saw me, too.
She saw you?
- Alicia saw you?
- Yeah, Alicia.
But she said it was no big deal.
I mean, she's used to it.
I guess he's a real man whore.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
She was like, you can do it anywhere you want, just not in my apartment.
But you know how it is.
GROSS:
We are negotiating.
ALICIA:
Zero is not a negotiation.
GROSS:
Well, then throw out some numbers.
ALICIA:
Mr. Gross, settle down.
Sorry we're late.
Where are we at?
We seem to be at zero.
VIOLA:
Well, don't forget, we've agreed not to sue
- for court costs.
- Stop playing games, Viola.
It's settle or hand over the algorithm.
Mm... no.
I think there's a third way.
And what's that?
Have you spoken to your clients?
You're right.
I do tend to buy out my irritants.
Just not their lawyers.
Oh, Alicia, hi.
We were just leaving a note.
You settled?
Mr. Gross hired us to run Wicked Savage Designs for him.
Their voice recognition software.
What happened to running your own company?
Things change.
Thank you, Alicia.
You guys were great.
If we ever get in trouble again, we will give a call.
(sighs)
(chuckles)
ALICIA:
What do you need, Eli?
Eli?
Do you and Peter have an open marriage?
(giggling)
I'll take that as a no.
Take it any way you want.
We interviewed the campaign worker who supposedly slept with Peter and she said you have an open marriage.
- Well, I can't stop what Peter says.
- No.
She said you told her.
She said you found her in your apartment bathroom, hiding, and you told her not to worry about sleeping with Peter because you have an open marriage... just so long as it's not at your apartment.
This is all a lie?
Good.
Then that means this campaign worker isn't just lying about Peter.
She is also lying about you.

'Cause if we are,
I think the demographic's all wrong.
We're still having trouble contacting the mom for an interview.
Any help there?
Jackie?
Sure.
She's probably circling the building.
- No, Alicia's mom.
- Oh.
That might prove a little more difficult.
- Let me check.
- Good.
Now, Will Gardner, Alicia's boss,
I still want to interview him.
Okay.
How about Diane Lockhart?

- Why?
They went to Georgetown together.
I'll see what I can do.
Is there anything else, Mandy?
An interview with Alicia wouldn't hurt.
It seems this cover story is more about Alicia than Peter.
No, we've just had greater access to Peter.

Get me some face time with Alicia.

This week.
Come on, Alicia, come on.
This is Alicia Florrick.
Please...
So, if I went looking for your voice recognition software...
Our name would be at the top.
And this is a search engine result from last year...
June 2011.
That's your software?
Margarita Motions?
Yes.
Julie and mine.
We named it after our moms.
Margaret and Rita.
Gizmodo considered it the top voice recognition software in the country, and you resisted being bought out by Apple and Microsoft.
Yes, we wanted to do it on our own, like our hero,
- Neil Gross.
- And what happened after June 2011?
We dropped.
Overnight, we dropped.
Now you have to flip through 28 pages of search results to find us.
And if I were to look for your software
- by using your name...?
- Try it.
Type it in.
"Do you want Margarita Mixes?"
It always corrects that way.
And you say this happened overnight?
Yes, it did.
June 13, 2011.
And why do you know that date so specifically?
Well, a week earlier, we were approached by a sales rep from Chumhum,
Mr. Gross's company.
They wanted us to buy ads for the search engine, and we said no; we wanted to save the money for hiring.
And then a week later, you dropped to page 28 in their results?
- Yes.
- And that's why you're suing for unfair trade practices?
Yes.
The problem is, if the search engine doesn't acknowledge you, you don't exist.
We went bankrupt.
We lost our money, our parents' money, our friends' money.
We read your book...
Mr. Gross, we went to the same college.
- We're just trying to do what you did.
- Objection, Your Honor.
Please ask the witness to refrain from addressing my client.
Would you like me to ask her to not look at him, too?
Okay, do I have to separate you two?
Can you please speak up?
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Ms. Sun... let me read you a review by the tech blogger
UberTech, posted two days before your search engine drop.
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized.
It stinks."
Don't you think your search engine drop was due to the negative reviews?
A drop isn't based on the quality of a product.
- It's based on how many people link to it.
- Yes.
But didn't, a week earlier, competing software,
Wicked Savage Designs, go on sale?
- And isn't it more popular?
- It is now.
Isn't it at the top of all voice-recognition searches?
Yes, but Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
What?
I said, Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
Well, here we are again.
- Good to see you, Mr. Gross.
- This is harassment, pure and simple.
I don't think you've met our newest associate,
- Cary Agos.
- Well, some people create,
- others destroy.
- Yup, I'll write that down.
Wait here, please.
We'll be right back.
They got the whole team.
I'll go get Julie and Elizabeth?
Good.
I want him to negotiate while our clients are staring right at him.
Uh, hello?
Is that him?
!
Is that the bastard?
How many drinks does it take?
!
How many?
!
You rented out our conference room?
In my capacity as trustee, supervising the restructuring of Lockhart-Gardner, and taking upon myself the task of seeking other cash-flow opportunities...
Mr. Hayden, we need our conference room.
It's for three days.
They're paying $8,765.
We're in the middle of a million-dollar negotiation.
Where do you want me to do it... in the bathroom?
Out of respect for his fellow alums, and without admitting fault...
You bitch!
You stupid bitch!
Um...
Mr. Gross is offering $123,000 to help defray Julie and Elizabeth's
- initial start-up costs. - It's odd, you're not smiling.
Usually when people joke, they smile.
You turn this down, ladies, and you'll see what deep pockets can do.
Why don't you refrain from speaking to our clients, Mr. Gross?
Why don't you tell them the truth... that you have no leverage here.
Leverage belongs to whomever can outlast.
And money outlasts.
We take this money, we can start over.
It doesn't even begin to address what we lost.
He won't pay more.
You heard him.
- We have no leverage here.
- Julie, give us a day.
If we don't have leverage by then, take the offer.
You're the trustee, right?
Yes.
And you are...?
Oh, I'm Viola Walsh.
I'm the defendant in your current suit.
Unfair trade practices.
May I help you?
You may.
We're gonna fight this to the last breath.
Your team is working on contingency.
And you don't fight Waterloo on contingency.
Now, I know that Will Gardner likes to battle with his ego, but I hope more dispassionate minds can rule.
Ms. Walsh, you have to negotiate with Mr. Gardner, not me.
You're watching out for the creditors, sir.
Will isn't.
And I don't think the creditors are going to be happy when you throw good work after bad.
I'm offering cash.
How much?
And that's how a search works.
Our software is like a gopher, but a really fast gopher.
It races through an index of billions of billions of Web pages all connected in a web of links.
We call this gopher, Chummie.
After Chummie finds all the pages connected to your search...
May I interrupt here?
Yes, Your Honor, of course.
Is it... is it loud enough?
Is this necessary?
Isn't it just trying to explain a template-based link analysis algorithm?
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- Okay.
Then we can turn it off.
There's no jury.
Just me.
Of course, Your Honor.
My apologies.
So there's no link between ad sales and search engine results?
That is correct.
Even if I wanted to impact the results,
I couldn't.
The algorithm acts on its own.
We don't touch it.
Thank you, Mr. Gross.
Why are you shaking your head, Mr. Gross?
I don't know.
The usual reasons.
Disbelief, incredulity, disappointment.
Ah.
I must be endangering the future.
No, just being a bit melodramatic.
So you never tweak the algorithm?
Chummie, the squirrel, just acts on his own?
No, I didn't say that.
But you said you couldn't impact the results.
Yes.
But the algorithm needs almost daily attention and revision.
I see.
And why would you revise it?
Well, for one thing, to avoid spam.
Spammers are constantly trying to game the search results.
We adapt the algorithm to avoid that.
Ah, so the quality of the Web page is taken into account in the algorithm?
Well, uh, uh, those are your words, but yes.
And that quality is determined on an almost-daily basis?
You said, "tweak the algorithm daily."
Yes.
Did you tweak the algorithm on June 13, 2011?
I have no idea.
But you said "almost daily," so probably?
I have no idea.
You have no idea whether the algorithm was tweaked on June 13, 2011, the day our clients' software dropped from page one on your search engine results to page 28?
That is correct.
Then, Your Honor, we subpoena Chumhum for records on their algorithm.
Your Honor, excuse me.
No.
The algorithm is the key to Chumhum's success.
It's their secret sauce.
If you expose the algorithm, you expose a trade secret.
So?
The defendant has admitted to changing the algorithm based on quality, which is the exact subject of this suit.
Your Honor, I just...
And the only way to determine whether the defendant's claims are true is to subpoena the evidence.
The best evidence rule applies here, Your Honor.
Your Honor, the plaintiff knows that we will never reveal the algorithm.
He is just using the court authority so that he can force us into a settlement.
The difficulty I see, Ms. Walsh, is that an attribute-based linked analysis is not a closed system.
Therefore, it is subject to manipulation.
So I am prone to order such a subpoena.
We ask for 24 hours
- to prepare our arguments.
- Sorry, I couldn't hear that.
We ask for 24 hours to prepare.
Remember when I used to sleep on your couch?
Eli.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm missing a speech to the National Council of La Raza.
- How about you?
- Working.
Do you mind closing the door?
What do you need, Eli?
We've never talked about this.
In fact, I've deliberately avoided talking about it.
By "it", you mean...?
You and Will.
Just so you know, I'd rather be doing anything else.
Okay.
Mandy Post, the reporter, wants to talk to you about your... affair.
Her word.
I pushed Mandy.
She seems to have a copy of a hotel receipt for a September 30, 2011... encounter... and I need to know if that timing makes sense.
I don't know.
There is a chance this all could be a bluff.
But do you have any way of checking if you were... if there was a hotel stay?
Is she going to press with this?
She hopes to.
- And I hope to stop her.
- Can you?
I don't know.
She likes to think of herself as a responsible journalist.
The good news is, responsible journalists are the easiest to co-opt.
Are you still seeing him?
Let me put it this way:
if you are still seeing...
Will... you need to stop.
For a time.
This magazine has been known to follow people.
I'm not seeing him.
Good.
Can I ask you when this stopped?
No.
4x03
- Two Girls, One Code -
- Yeah?
- It's me.
Where are you?
Don't you come to work anymore?
What do you need, Eli?
Your help.
And first of all, let me say it's not what you think... it's only tangentially about the campaign.
I'm not helping Peter.
It's not about...
Who's Peter?
Someone.
You have a lot of someones in your life.
Yeah.
I want one of your omelets.
Hey, Bill wants to come over.
To say hi.
You know, he doesn't blame you anymore.
He's getting the cast off, and...
I was just thinking that... right.
So that's how we're gonna play it, is it?
How's that?
Yeah, that's better.
You know, you have a strange idea... of how things work now.
I'm the husband and you're the wife.
Yeah.
And this isn't your home anymore.
Clean it up.
Thomas Giles.
I work as a search engine optimizer.
- And what is that?
- Ms. Walsh,
I know what a search engine optimizer is.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Of course.
When you offer your services, Mr. Giles,
- what is it that you guarantee?
- To get my clients
- onto the first page of a Chumhum search engine result.
- I see.
And did the plaintiffs hire you to do...
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.
This is a preliminary hearing to discuss
- the subpoena of Chumhum's algorithm.
- Yes, but the question of damages must be established before the question of a subpoena.
How many witnesses do you intend?
To establish the absence of damages?
Two.
I will allow.
And did the plaintiffs hire you to get their product on the first page of a Chumhum search?
Yes.
In other words, the plaintiffs hired you
- to "game" the system.
- Objection!
And the Chumhum algorithm just countered that gaming...
Objection.
- Overruled.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
Miss Holmes, where do you work?
In Chumhum's advertising department.
You're the evil advertiser who approached the plaintiffs about an online ad?
Well, I hope not evil, but yes.
- And they turned you down.
- Yes.
- Unfortunately, it happens.
- So you immediately told Mr. Gross, so that he could meddle with the algorithm and get back at them?
- No.
- You didn't?
Really?
Because that just seems like the sensible next step.
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.
- What did you do next, Miss Holmes?
- Well,
- after they said no, I went on vacation.
- You did?
- For how long?
- Two weeks.
And did you tell anyone at Chumhum about the plaintiff's
- ad rejection?
- Before vacation?
No.
It was bad news.
I usually hold off on bad news.
- So, just so I'm clear, you never told anyone...
- I get it, Ms. Walsh.
Any change in the algorithm couldn't have come from the advertising department because Miss Holmes was on vacation.
- Do you have any documentation to that effect?
- Of course, Your Honor.
- You're on it?
- Yeah.
How long have I got?
We're back in court tomorrow.
There's got to be someone this advertising rep told before her vacation.
We got this?
Were we together on September 30 last year?
Together?
I don't know.
Why?
At a hotel?
Maybe.
I don't know.
But you paid.
I don't remember,
- was it that hotel downtown, the Fairmont?
- I can look.
Thanks.
Mandy Post says she has a copy of the receipt.
I don't see how she could.
Well, Eli needs something to... refute her.
She's gonna print it?
Eli's having a meeting with her tonight to convince her not to.
I'll look right away.
You okay?
I don't know.
I feel cursed.
Will...
I like you, and that's why I'm giving you a chance to save face.
We're upping our offer 20%.
You want a divorce?
!
You got it!
We want this over.
We're offering $160,000.
Will, I know that your ego is invested in this, but I hope that more dispassionate minds rule.
Oh, no, what do you have for us now?
You were right... it wasn't about the advertising; that's not why you messed with the algorithm.
- Then why are we still talking?
- You messed with the algorithm because Mr. Gross secretly bought out
Wicked Savage Designs.
He bought the top competing voice-recognition software, and a week later, Margarita dropped on his search engine, and Wicked Savage climbed.
We're presenting it in court tomorrow unless you come up with a real offer.
Well, that was satisfying.
Sometimes the stars align.
What are you doing?
Talking to Viola.
- Ms. Walsh?
Yes.
- We're in negotiations with her!
Calm down, Ms. Lockhart.
No.
You don't sabotage Will.
- How am I sabotaging?
- By talking to her.
Is she saying Will is a problematic negotiator and you need to step in?
Is she lowballing you?
- Yes, of course she is!
- I'll go to the judge...
I will get you replaced for sabotaging our negotiations, I swear!
I am helping you!
Of course she's lowballing me.
I'm not dumb.
I'm getting her offer up.
Why do you think she added 20%?
She thinks she's pulling me on to her side.
But she's not?
Ms. Lockhart...
I work for the firm.
Yes, I have the power to veto you and Mr. Gardner, but your success... is my success.
You have been paranoid for so long, you don't recognize when someone is on your side.
No.
Actually, I'm waiting for a call.
- I'm just gonna call about homework.
- Eli is calling this number, and I don't want to miss it.
- I'll get the call waiting.
- Grace, I said no.
In ten minutes.
Hello?
- Alicia?
- Yeah.
Eli?
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.
I'm here with Mandy, talking over the story.
Yeah.
You're in the clear.
How?
She got the date wrong?
No.
It's, uh...
I... it's not about you.
Don't worry.
Eli, thank you.
I...
Thank you.
Okay, I gotta go.
Take care.
Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
- Can I have the phone now?
"May I have the phone now?"
May I?
I love you.
I love you, too.
- You all right?
Yeah.
Oh, actually, I do need the phone, just for one minute.
Now?
Yeah, I left my cell phone at work.
Alicia, hi.
How are you?
Okay.
We're okay.
You talked to Eli?
Just now.
It wasn't about us.
Good.
Who's it about?
Um...
I've gotta go.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling, Alicia.
You're welcome.
You've reached the voice mail of Eli Gold.
Zach, Grace, I'm going to go out for a few minutes.
Alicia, hey.
Everything all right?
I don't know, Eli, is it?
Mandy.
You said it wasn't about us, so who's it about?
Alicia.
Eli, it's going to come out anyway.
It's, it's a lie, it's gossip, the same as when we thought it was you and Will.
I'm gonna make this easy.
There's a rumor of Peter sleeping with someone last year.
Mandy has a hotel receipt?
We were separated, Eli.
Just tell me.
I'm just getting to the bottom of this now.
And I haven't told Peter.
Supposedly it's a campaign worker, but it's pure fiction.
Alicia... this is politics.
Peter is vulnerable in this, and that is why it's being used.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I have to go.
You know, you did call me.
I know.
Tomorrow night?
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Lana, I really have to go.
Kalinda, you come here, and I feel like I'm warming you up for someone else.
You're not.
Hey.
Hi.
You seem good.
I'm excited about the case.
Uh, Your Honor, before we begin, I believe there's still a question of standing.
No, Your Honor, there's no question of standing.
There is a question of Chumhum's purchase of Wicked Savage.
Yes, but first there is a question of standing being raised by Chancellor Carlyle.
- Who?
- Your Honor, I am the chancellor of Chicago Polytechnic.
I'm happy for you.
Now, what do you want?
I'm here to assert the university's ownership of the software titled Margarita Motions.
What?
!
If I could point to page 42 of the university's student handbook:
"The college owns the right to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries"
created by employees or students..."
You're kidding... we invented this.
Yes, but on school property and using school resources.
There is a legal precedent here,
Your Honor.
Google was forced to negotiate with Stanford over the rights to Google, and the University of Illinois sued one of the co-founders of Netscape for trademark infringement.
Therefore, we ask that the subpoena be quashed, given that the plaintiffs' standing here is unclear.
Just give me a listen.
Uh, I'm on a case, Eli.
It's for Alicia, not Peter.
Look, Peter is being accused of sleeping with a campaign worker, and he didn't.
I'm just trying to stop the story before it embarrasses Alicia.
- Embarrasses Alicia?
- Yes.
After all she's been through, you know it will.
Just listen to the reporter's questions, that's all.
This is Kalinda, my assistant.
I asked her to sit in.
Hi.
Really?
I thought we were finishing up.
Oh, no, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
If you want face time with Peter and Alicia,
I'll need to know what you're going to ask.
His assistant, huh?
Peter Florrick and one of his campaign workers slept together on September 30.
Where?
Eli, we vetted this.
Then what's your worry?
The St. Martin.
Was she visiting him or he visiting her?
They were both there.
Campaign workers on one floor,
- Peter on another.
- And which room did they go to?
They had a prearranged signal.
She was to go to his floor at 11:30 and knock on his door.
On how many occasions?
What's her name?
No.
Mandy, if it's true...
And if I tell you, you'll have no reason to buy the magazine.
Get me face time.
Eli told me.
Peter, let's not do this, please.
It's not true;
I wanted you to know.
Seriously, Peter, I have had a very long day, and by the end of the week,
I will have had a very long week.
Look, I have a target on my back, and this is not true.
Do you remember what you said the first time?
"It's not true."
And that's exactly why they're throwing this crap at me... because my denials will look like lies.
It's politics.
The problem is, Peter, I don't give a damn.
Good morning, Chancellor.
What's this, Chancellor?
It's my book... a book I wrote about ways to improve education in America.
And what income did you derive from this book?
In royalties?
I... well, I don't have the facts and figures at my fingertips.
I do, actually.
$71,450, mostly due to students being required to buy it as a textbook.
Now, how much of that money went to the college?
How much?
You mean, of the royalties?
I don't know.
Did any portion go to the college?
I... no.
But you're a college employee, aren't you, sir?
And the student handbook here clearly states,
"College owns the rights to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries created by employees and students."
Yes, but that's not a fair comparison.
I'm the university chancellor.
So the rules don't apply to you?
No, that's not what I said.
The college is selective in how it enforces its rules?
Oh, come on.
There is a radical difference between $71,000 in royalties and the potential millions from the plaintiffs' voice recognition software.
Yes, thank you for prompting the good chancellor in how to answer my question, but...
Objection, Your Honor.
I find this line of question offensive and irrelevant.
No, it isn't, Ms. Walsh; it actually isn't.
Please continue, Counselor.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Is Mr. Neil Gross a graduate of your university?
He is an honored graduate.
And did you know that his company Chumhum is worth $86 billion?
Well, even if you didn't know that, you knew that he'd given a $50 million endowment to the university.
- Yes.
- So... have you claimed ownership of Chumhum?
No.
Really?
But you read in his book that he created his page-ranking hierarchy in your computer lab.
Okay, that's enough.
I'm ready to rule on standing.
It is my determination that, due to estoppel by silence and my general disgust with the chancellor's tactics...
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.
This is my court; you may go now.
Thank you.
The college has no standing here, and the interests of the plaintiff' suit holds sway.
Yes!
Yes!
I also find that Mr. Gross will open all pertinent aspects of his algorithm
- to scrutiny...
- Your Honor, we cannot allow
- the algorithm, as you know...
- Yes, you can.
Ms. Walsh, what you cannot do is hide behind the skirts of trade secrets indefinitely.
I will appoint a third party to peruse all algorithm documents, in order to avoid competitive leaking.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes.
I know what you're doing.
Your firm's bankrupt.
You lost my competitor, Patrick Edelstein, so you're looking for another big fish.
You know I have a tendency to buy out my irritants, hire firms who sue me, so this... just a little performance piece.
Well, not to toot our own horn, Mr. Gross, but there is strategic advantage in hiring the firm that used to represent your competition.
Although we're legally bound by attorney-client privilege, we know how Mr. Edelstein works and we know how to beat him.
You're right... strategically smart... but, you see, here's the I don't like you and I intend to go out of my way to never hire you.
Nice talking with you.
Look, Mr. Gross, little advice:
If you're looking for a good lawyer, don't go with who you like.
If I can irritate you like this, just think what I can do to your enemies.
I'm rich enough not to care.
There were 12 campaign workers at the St. Martin, ten of them female.
Who's that?
Indira Starr, advance.
And she was at the hotel?
Yeah, why?
Kalinda, it is not true.
Peter did not sleep with her.
Eli...
I want you to look at this speech...
Hi, Peter.
Peter, you know Kalinda Sharma?
Yes, in the State's Attorney's Office.
- Of course, yeah.
- She's helping us with, uh, Mandy Post.
Excuse me.
Uh, you want the photo?
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.
Sure.
You have her on this?
Yeah, why?
She wants to be on it?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Okay.
- What do I need to know here, Peter?
Nothing.
Let's go over this.
You're reluctant to reveal the Chumhum algorithm to the court.
Why is that?
Well, for the obvious reason, it's our crown jewels.
Other companies would pay millions for access to it.
And you're here to tell the court that you won't acquiesce to their subpoena,
- is that right?
- Yes, but I believe
I have the law on my side.
Why is that?
- The First Amendment.
- Oh, dear God.
Mr. Gardner.
Please.
Our search engine results are protected by free speech.
To compel their release is the same as compelling a newspaper to reveal its sources.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Therefore, you have editorial discretion, Mr. Gross?
Yes, and that is why I am resisting this subpoena.
Hey.
Hey.
- Kalinda, hello.
- Hey.
This must be your friend.
Kalinda is it?
How are you doing?
I'm Nick.
He was just keeping me company.
Thrilling me with his accent.
Oh, I was trying to.
So how do you two know each other?
- Just friends.
- Really?
You seem like more.
Well, I don't know.
You seem like, uh, adopted sisters or something.
No.
Friends from way back.
Let me get you both a drink.
Friends.
Sure.
Oh, I've just got something through.
Sorry.
Will you excuse me, please?
I'm just gonna be one second.
Dyke.
Kevin Costas.
I'm a blogger.
My blog, UberTech, was awarded one of the Top 25 Tech Blogs of 2010 by Engadget.
Congratulations.
And on your blog you wrote:
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized... it stinks."
Yes.
And how do you know it was plagiarized?
How do I know the software was?
Because it was.
'Cause it's not very good.
And you have proof they stole it?
You mean, actual proof?
No.
But I don't need it.
It's my opinion.
Objection, Your Honor.
What does this have to do with the lawsuit?
Mr. Gross is claiming editorial discretion for his search engine, therefore he is responsible for its editorial content...
- Wait a minute...
- They can't have their cake and eat it too, Your Honor.
If they insist on free speech protections, then they're responsible for that speech.
Your Honor...
No, Ms. Walsh, she's right.
Overruled.
So, Mr. Costas, you printed the accusation of plagiarism without checking truth or falsehood?
I didn't need to.
And did Mr. Gross, or anyone from Chumhum, ask you for evidence as to the truth of your accusation?
Uh... from Chumhum?
Uh, no.
Judge, this is absurd.
Chumhum has millions of pages.
If my client is gonna be held liable for every single one...
Well, then there will be a hell of a lot
- of defamation suits.
- Yes, Ms. Walsh.
I'm not making a free speech argument.
You are.
One million dollars.
But you have to take it now.
No consulting with Will.
No second guessing.
Just business between two like minds.
No.
- We're not going higher.
- That's probably true.
It's one million dollars.
This firm is bankrupt.
Then negotiate with Will.
Tell him.
But I'll advise him not to take it.
Why?
I've seen the evidence.
- You're a businessman.
- Yes.
Show a businessman a winning hand, he doesn't need to be a gambler to go all in.
I'm going all in.
Will has gotten to you.
He's put dollar signs in your eyes.
I'm trying to be the peacemaker here.
Why aren't people just upfront with what they want?
Why don't they ever just say what they mean?
Well, you have chosen a really strange time to get philosophical.
No.
It's the perfect time.
Thank you.
At first I was just... you know, flirtatious.
Older guys like to flirt with me.
- I have a nice laugh.
- And then you two had sex?
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.
I told that reporter, it's not like I'm some Rielle Hunter.
How many times did you have sex?
Maybe eight times.
I don't know.
Was it always at a hotel?
No, uh, twice at his apartment.
Once, we were doing it in the bedroom and we heard his wife coming home.
Yeah, it was like something out of a movie.
I had to hide in the bathroom.
She saw me, too.
She saw you?
- Alicia saw you?
- Yeah, Alicia.
But she said it was no big deal.
I mean, she's used to it.
I guess he's a real man whore.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
She was like, you can do it anywhere you want, just not in my apartment.
But you know how it is.
We are negotiating.
Zero is not a negotiation.
Well, then throw out some numbers.
Mr. Gross, settle down.
Sorry we're late.
Where are we at?
We seem to be at zero.
Well, don't forget, we've agreed not to sue
- for court costs.
- Stop playing games, Viola.
It's settle or hand over the algorithm.
Mm... no.
I think there's a third way.
And what's that?
Have you spoken to your clients?
You're right.
I do tend to buy out my irritants.
Just not their lawyers.
Oh, Alicia, hi.
We were just leaving a note.
You settled?
Mr. Gross hired us to run Wicked Savage Designs for him.
Their voice recognition software.
What happened to running your own company?
Things change.
Thank you, Alicia.
You guys were great.
If we ever get in trouble again, we will give a call.
What do you need, Eli?
Eli?
Do you and Peter have an open marriage?
I'll take that as a no.
Take it any way you want.
We interviewed the campaign worker who supposedly slept with Peter and she said you have an open marriage.
- Well, I can't stop what Peter says.
- No.
She said you told her.
She said you found her in your apartment bathroom, hiding, and you told her not to worry about sleeping with Peter because you have an open marriage... just so long as it's not at your apartment.
This is all a lie?
Good.
Then that means this campaign worker isn't just lying about Peter.
She is also lying about you.

Get me some face time with Alicia.

This week.
(line ringing)
Come on, Alicia, come on.
This is Alicia Florrick.
Please... (phone beeps off)
ALICIA:
So, if I went looking for your voice recognition software...
WOMAN:
Our name would be at the top.
ALICIA:
And this is a search engine result from last year...
June 2011.
That's your software?
Margarita Motions?
Yes.
Julie and mine.
We named it after our moms.
Margaret and Rita.
Gizmodo considered it the top voice recognition software in the country, and you resisted being bought out by Apple and Microsoft.
Yes, we wanted to do it on our own, like our hero,
- Neil Gross.
- And what happened after June 2011?
We dropped.
Overnight, we dropped.
Now you have to flip through 28 pages of search results to find us.
And if I were to look for your software
- by using your name...?
- Try it.
Type it in.
"Do you want Margarita Mixes?"
It always corrects that way.
And you say this happened overnight?
Yes, it did.
June 13, 2011.
And why do you know that date so specifically?
Well, a week earlier, we were approached by a sales rep from Chumhum,
Mr. Gross's company.
They wanted us to buy ads for the search engine, and we said no; we wanted to save the money for hiring.
And then a week later, you dropped to page 28 in their results?
- Yes.
- And that's why you're suing for unfair trade practices?
Yes.
The problem is, if the search engine doesn't acknowledge you, you don't exist.
We went bankrupt.
We lost our money, our parents' money, our friends' money.
We read your book...
Mr. Gross, we went to the same college.
- We're just trying to do what you did.
- Objection, Your Honor.
Please ask the witness to refrain from addressing my client.
Would you like me to ask her to not look at him, too?
Okay, do I have to separate you two?
Can you please speak up?
Nothing further, Your Honor.
LAWYER:
Ms. Sun... let me read you a review by the tech blogger
UberTech, posted two days before your search engine drop.
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized.
It stinks."
Don't you think your search engine drop was due to the negative reviews?
A drop isn't based on the quality of a product.
- It's based on how many people link to it.
- Yes.
But didn't, a week earlier, competing software,
Wicked Savage Designs, go on sale?
- And isn't it more popular?
- It is now.
Isn't it at the top of all voice-recognition searches?
Yes, but Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
JUDGE MARX:
What?
I said, Wicked Savage also took out Chumhum ads.
(elevator bell dings)
Well, here we are again.
- Good to see you, Mr. Gross.
- This is harassment, pure and simple.
I don't think you've met our newest associate,
- Cary Agos.
- Well, some people create,
- others destroy.
- Yup, I'll write that down.
Wait here, please.
We'll be right back.
They got the whole team.
I'll go get Julie and Elizabeth?
Good.
I want him to negotiate while our clients are staring right at him.
(indistinct, overlapping chatter)
Uh, hello?
Is that him?
!
Is that the bastard?
How many drinks does it take?
!
How many?
!
You rented out our conference room?
In my capacity as trustee, supervising the restructuring of Lockhart-Gardner, and taking upon myself the task of seeking other cash-flow opportunities...
Mr. Hayden, we need our conference room.
It's for three days.
They're paying $8,765.
We're in the middle of a million-dollar negotiation.
Where do you want me to do it... in the bathroom?
Out of respect for his fellow alums, and without admitting fault...
MAN:
You bitch!
You stupid bitch!
Um...
Mr. Gross is offering $123,000 to help defray Julie and Elizabeth's
- initial start-up costs. - It's odd, you're not smiling.
Usually when people joke, they smile.
You turn this down, ladies, and you'll see what deep pockets can do.
CARY:
Why don't you refrain from speaking to our clients, Mr. Gross?
Why don't you tell them the truth... that you have no leverage here.
Leverage belongs to whomever can outlast.
And money outlasts.
We take this money, we can start over.
ELIZABETH:
It doesn't even begin to address what we lost.
JULIE:
He won't pay more.
You heard him.
- We have no leverage here.
- WILL:
Julie, give us a day.
If we don't have leverage by then, take the offer.
WOMAN:
You're the trustee, right?
Yes.
And you are...?
Oh, I'm Viola Walsh.
I'm the defendant in your current suit.
Unfair trade practices.
May I help you?
You may.
We're gonna fight this to the last breath.
Your team is working on contingency.
And you don't fight Waterloo on contingency.
Now, I know that Will Gardner likes to battle with his ego, but I hope more dispassionate minds can rule.
Ms. Walsh, you have to negotiate with Mr. Gardner, not me.
You're watching out for the creditors, sir.
Will isn't.
And I don't think the creditors are going to be happy when you throw good work after bad.
I'm offering cash.
How much?
MAN:
And that's how a search works.
Our software is like a gopher, but a really fast gopher.
(chittering) (laughs)
It races through an index of billions of billions of Web pages all connected in a web of links.
We call this gopher, Chummie.
After Chummie finds all the pages connected to your search...
May I interrupt here?
Yes, Your Honor, of course.
Is it... is it loud enough?
Is this necessary?
Isn't it just trying to explain a template-based link analysis algorithm?
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- Okay.
Then we can turn it off.
There's no jury.
Just me.
VIOLA:
Of course, Your Honor.
My apologies.
So there's no link between ad sales and search engine results?
That is correct.
Even if I wanted to impact the results,
I couldn't.
The algorithm acts on its own.
We don't touch it.
VIOLA:
Thank you, Mr. Gross.
Why are you shaking your head, Mr. Gross?
GROSS:
I don't know.
The usual reasons.
Disbelief, incredulity, disappointment.
Ah.
I must be endangering the future.
No, just being a bit melodramatic.
So you never tweak the algorithm?
Chummie, the squirrel, just acts on his own?
No, I didn't say that.
But you said you couldn't impact the results.
Yes.
But the algorithm needs almost daily attention and revision.
I see.
And why would you revise it?
(scoffs) Well, for one thing, to avoid spam.
Spammers are constantly trying to game the search results.
We adapt the algorithm to avoid that.
Ah, so the quality of the Web page is taken into account in the algorithm?
Well, uh, uh, those are your words, but yes.
And that quality is determined on an almost-daily basis?
You said, "tweak the algorithm daily."
Yes.
Did you tweak the algorithm on June 13, 2011?
I have no idea.
But you said "almost daily," so probably?
I have no idea.
You have no idea whether the algorithm was tweaked on June 13, 2011, the day our clients' software dropped from page one on your search engine results to page 28?
That is correct.
Then, Your Honor, we subpoena Chumhum for records on their algorithm.
Your Honor, excuse me.
No.
The algorithm is the key to Chumhum's success.
It's their secret sauce.
If you expose the algorithm, you expose a trade secret.
So?
The defendant has admitted to changing the algorithm based on quality, which is the exact subject of this suit.
Your Honor, I just...
And the only way to determine whether the defendant's claims are true is to subpoena the evidence.
The best evidence rule applies here, Your Honor.
Your Honor, the plaintiff knows that we will never reveal the algorithm.
He is just using the court authority so that he can force us into a settlement.
The difficulty I see, Ms. Walsh, is that an attribute-based linked analysis is not a closed system.
Therefore, it is subject to manipulation.
So I am prone to order such a subpoena.
We ask for 24 hours
- to prepare our arguments.
- Sorry, I couldn't hear that.
(louder):
We ask for 24 hours to prepare.
(gavel bangs)
Remember when I used to sleep on your couch?
Eli.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm missing a speech to the National Council of La Raza.
- How about you?
- Working.
Do you mind closing the door?
What do you need, Eli?
We've never talked about this.
In fact, I've deliberately avoided talking about it.
By "it", you mean...?
You and Will.
Just so you know, I'd rather be doing anything else.
Okay.
Mandy Post, the reporter, wants to talk to you about your... affair.
Her word.
I pushed Mandy.
She seems to have a copy of a hotel receipt for a September 30, 2011... encounter... and I need to know if that timing makes sense.
I don't know.
There is a chance this all could be a bluff.
But do you have any way of checking if you were... if there was a hotel stay?
Is she going to press with this?
She hopes to.
- And I hope to stop her.
- Can you?
I don't know.
She likes to think of herself as a responsible journalist.
The good news is, responsible journalists are the easiest to co-opt.
Are you still seeing him?
Let me put it this way:
if you are still seeing... (quietly):
Will... you need to stop.
For a time.
This magazine has been known to follow people.
I'm not seeing him.
Good.
Can I ask you when this stopped?
No.
(door opens)
(phones ringing, indistinct chatter)
(sighs)
(panting)
4x03
- Two Girls, One Code -
(phone vibrates)
- Yeah?
- ELI:
It's me.
Where are you?
Don't you come to work anymore?
What do you need, Eli?
Your help.
And first of all, let me say it's not what you think... it's only tangentially about the campaign.
I'm not helping Peter.
ELI:
It's not about... (phone beeps off)
Who's Peter?
Someone.
You have a lot of someones in your life.
Yeah.
I want one of your omelets.
Hey, Bill wants to come over.
To say hi.
You know, he doesn't blame you anymore.
He's getting the cast off, and...
I was just thinking that... (sighs) right.
So that's how we're gonna play it, is it?
How's that?
Yeah, that's better.
(drops knife to counter)
You know, you have a strange idea... of how things work now.
I'm the husband and you're the wife.
Yeah.
And this isn't your home anymore.
Clean it up.
(door opens)
(door closes)
Thomas Giles.
I work as a search engine optimizer.
- And what is that?
- Ms. Walsh,
I know what a search engine optimizer is.
(chuckles):
Thank you, Your Honor.
Of course.
When you offer your services, Mr. Giles,
- what is it that you guarantee?
- To get my clients
- onto the first page of a Chumhum search engine result.
- I see.
And did the plaintiffs hire you to do...
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.
This is a preliminary hearing to discuss
- the subpoena of Chumhum's algorithm.
- Yes, but the question of damages must be established before the question of a subpoena.
How many witnesses do you intend?
To establish the absence of damages?
Two.
I will allow.
And did the plaintiffs hire you to get their product on the first page of a Chumhum search?
Yes.
In other words, the plaintiffs hired you
- to "game" the system.
- Objection!
And the Chumhum algorithm just countered that gaming...
Objection.
- Overruled.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
Miss Holmes, where do you work?
In Chumhum's advertising department.
You're the evil advertiser who approached the plaintiffs about an online ad?
HOLMES:
Well, I hope not evil, but yes.
- And they turned you down.
- Yes.
- Unfortunately, it happens.
- So you immediately told Mr. Gross, so that he could meddle with the algorithm and get back at them?
- No.
- You didn't?
Really?
Because that just seems like the sensible next step.
- CARY:
Objection.
- Withdrawn.
- What did you do next, Miss Holmes?
- Well,
- after they said no, I went on vacation.
- You did?
- For how long?
- Two weeks.
And did you tell anyone at Chumhum about the plaintiff's
- ad rejection?
- Before vacation?
No.
It was bad news.
I usually hold off on bad news.
- So, just so I'm clear, you never told anyone...
- I get it, Ms. Walsh.
Any change in the algorithm couldn't have come from the advertising department because Miss Holmes was on vacation.
- Do you have any documentation to that effect?
- Of course, Your Honor.
(elevator bell dings)
- You're on it?
- Yeah.
How long have I got?
We're back in court tomorrow.
There's got to be someone this advertising rep told before her vacation.
We got this?
Were we together on September 30 last year?
Together?
I don't know.
Why?
At a hotel?
Maybe.
I don't know.
But you paid.
I don't remember,
- was it that hotel downtown, the Fairmont?
- I can look.
Thanks.
Mandy Post says she has a copy of the receipt.
I don't see how she could.
Well, Eli needs something to... refute her.
She's gonna print it?
Eli's having a meeting with her tonight to convince her not to.
I'll look right away.
You okay?
I don't know.
I feel cursed.
(door closes)
Will...
I like you, and that's why I'm giving you a chance to save face.
We're upping our offer 20%.
MAN (in distance):
You want a divorce?
!
You got it!
We want this over.
We're offering $160,000.
(giggling)
Will, I know that your ego is invested in this, but I hope that more dispassionate minds rule.
Oh, no, what do you have for us now?
You were right... it wasn't about the advertising; that's not why you messed with the algorithm.
- Then why are we still talking?
- You messed with the algorithm because Mr. Gross secretly bought out
Wicked Savage Designs.
He bought the top competing voice-recognition software, and a week later, Margarita dropped on his search engine, and Wicked Savage climbed.
CARY:
We're presenting it in court tomorrow unless you come up with a real offer.
Well, that was satisfying.
Sometimes the stars align.
(door slams)
What are you doing?
Talking to Viola.
- Ms. Walsh?
Yes.
- We're in negotiations with her!
Calm down, Ms. Lockhart.
No.
You don't sabotage Will.
- How am I sabotaging?
- By talking to her.
Is she saying Will is a problematic negotiator and you need to step in?
Is she lowballing you?
- Yes, of course she is!
- I'll go to the judge...
I will get you replaced for sabotaging our negotiations, I swear!
I am helping you!
Of course she's lowballing me.
I'm not dumb.
I'm getting her offer up.
Why do you think she added 20%?
She thinks she's pulling me on to her side.
But she's not?
Ms. Lockhart...
I work for the firm.
Yes, I have the power to veto you and Mr. Gardner, but your success... is my success.
You have been paranoid for so long, you don't recognize when someone is on your side.
No.
Actually, I'm waiting for a call.
- I'm just gonna call about homework.
- Eli is calling this number, and I don't want to miss it.
- I'll get the call waiting.
- Grace, I said no.
In ten minutes.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
- Alicia?
- Yeah.
Eli?
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.
I'm here with Mandy, talking over the story.
Yeah.
You're in the clear.
(inhales)
How?
She got the date wrong?
No.
It's, uh...
I... it's not about you.
Don't worry.
Eli, thank you.
I...
Thank you.
Okay, I gotta go.
Take care. (click)
(sighs with relief)
ZACH:
Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
- GRACE:
Can I have the phone now?
"May I have the phone now?"
May I?
I love you.
I love you, too.
- You all right?
- (whispers):
Yeah.
Oh, actually, I do need the phone, just for one minute.
Now?
Yeah, I left my cell phone at work.
(phone ringing)
(beep)
Alicia, hi.
How are you?
Okay.
(laughs softly)
We're okay.
You talked to Eli?
Just now.
It wasn't about us.
Good.
Who's it about?
Um... (clears throat) I've gotta go.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling, Alicia.
You're welcome.
(phone keypad beeping)
(line ringing)
ELI:
You've reached the voice mail of Eli Gold.
(phone beeps off)
Zach, Grace, I'm going to go out for a few minutes.
(elevator bell dings)
Alicia, hey.
Everything all right?
I don't know, Eli, is it?
(sighs)
Mandy.
You said it wasn't about us, so who's it about?
(sighs) Alicia.
Eli, it's going to come out anyway.
It's, it's a lie, it's gossip, the same as when we thought it was you and Will.
I'm gonna make this easy.
There's a rumor of Peter sleeping with someone last year.
Mandy has a hotel receipt?
We were separated, Eli.
Just tell me.
I'm just getting to the bottom of this now.
And I haven't told Peter.
Supposedly it's a campaign worker, but it's pure fiction.
Alicia... this is politics.
Peter is vulnerable in this, and that is why it's being used.
What's wrong?
Nothing. (phone rings)
I have to go.
You know, you did call me.
I know.
Tomorrow night?
(scoffs)
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Lana, I really have to go.
Kalinda, you come here, and I feel like I'm warming you up for someone else.
You're not.
Hey.
Hi.
You seem good.
I'm excited about the case.
Uh, Your Honor, before we begin, I believe there's still a question of standing.
No, Your Honor, there's no question of standing.
There is a question of Chumhum's purchase of Wicked Savage.
Yes, but first there is a question of standing being raised by Chancellor Carlyle.
- Who?
- MAN:
Your Honor, I am the chancellor of Chicago Polytechnic.
I'm happy for you.
Now, what do you want?
I'm here to assert the university's ownership of the software titled Margarita Motions.
What?
!
If I could point to page 42 of the university's student handbook:
"The college owns the right to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries"
created by employees or students..."
You're kidding... we invented this.
Yes, but on school property and using school resources.
There is a legal precedent here,
Your Honor.
Google was forced to negotiate with Stanford over the rights to Google, and the University of Illinois sued one of the co-founders of Netscape for trademark infringement.
Therefore, we ask that the subpoena be quashed, given that the plaintiffs' standing here is unclear.
Just give me a listen.
Uh, I'm on a case, Eli.
It's for Alicia, not Peter.
Look, Peter is being accused of sleeping with a campaign worker, and he didn't.
I'm just trying to stop the story before it embarrasses Alicia.
- Embarrasses Alicia?
- Yes.
After all she's been through, you know it will.
Just listen to the reporter's questions, that's all.
This is Kalinda, my assistant.
I asked her to sit in.
Hi.
Really?
I thought we were finishing up.
Oh, no, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
If you want face time with Peter and Alicia,
I'll need to know what you're going to ask.
His assistant, huh?
(sighs)
Peter Florrick and one of his campaign workers slept together on September 30.
Where?
Eli, we vetted this.
Then what's your worry?
(sighs)
The St. Martin.
Was she visiting him or he visiting her?
They were both there.
Campaign workers on one floor,
- Peter on another.
- And which room did they go to?
They had a prearranged signal.
She was to go to his floor at 11:30 and knock on his door.
KALINDA:
On how many occasions?
What's her name?
No.
ELI:
Mandy, if it's true...
And if I tell you, you'll have no reason to buy the magazine.
Get me face time.
Eli told me.
Peter, let's not do this, please.
It's not true;
I wanted you to know.
Seriously, Peter, I have had a very long day, and by the end of the week,
I will have had a very long week.
Look, I have a target on my back, and this is not true.
Do you remember what you said the first time?
"It's not true."
And that's exactly why they're throwing this crap at me... because my denials will look like lies.
It's politics.
The problem is, Peter, I don't give a damn.
WILL:
Good morning, Chancellor.
What's this, Chancellor?
It's my book... a book I wrote about ways to improve education in America.
And what income did you derive from this book?
In royalties?
I... well, I don't have the facts and figures at my fingertips.
I do, actually.
$71,450, mostly due to students being required to buy it as a textbook.
Now, how much of that money went to the college?
CARLYLE:
How much?
You mean, of the royalties?
I don't know.
Did any portion go to the college?
I... no.
But you're a college employee, aren't you, sir?
And the student handbook here clearly states,
"College owns the rights to all works, inventions, developments, and discoveries created by employees and students."
Yes, but that's not a fair comparison.
I'm the university chancellor.
So the rules don't apply to you?
No, that's not what I said.
The college is selective in how it enforces its rules?
Oh, come on.
There is a radical difference between $71,000 in royalties and the potential millions from the plaintiffs' voice recognition software.
Yes, thank you for prompting the good chancellor in how to answer my question, but...
Objection, Your Honor.
I find this line of question offensive and irrelevant.
No, it isn't, Ms. Walsh; it actually isn't.
Please continue, Counselor.
WILL:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Is Mr. Neil Gross a graduate of your university?
He is an honored graduate.
And did you know that his company Chumhum is worth $86 billion?
Well, even if you didn't know that, you knew that he'd given a $50 million endowment to the university.
- Yes.
- So... have you claimed ownership of Chumhum?
No.
Really?
But you read in his book that he created his page-ranking hierarchy in your computer lab.
MARX:
Okay, that's enough.
I'm ready to rule on standing.
It is my determination that, due to estoppel by silence and my general disgust with the chancellor's tactics...
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.
This is my court; you may go now.
Thank you.
The college has no standing here, and the interests of the plaintiff' suit holds sway.
Yes!
Yes!
I also find that Mr. Gross will open all pertinent aspects of his algorithm
- to scrutiny...
- Your Honor, we cannot allow
- the algorithm, as you know...
- Yes, you can.
Ms. Walsh, what you cannot do is hide behind the skirts of trade secrets indefinitely.
I will appoint a third party to peruse all algorithm documents, in order to avoid competitive leaking.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes.
I know what you're doing.
Your firm's bankrupt.
You lost my competitor, Patrick Edelstein, so you're looking for another big fish.
You know I have a tendency to buy out my irritants, hire firms who sue me, so this... just a little performance piece.
Well, not to toot our own horn, Mr. Gross, but there is strategic advantage in hiring the firm that used to represent your competition.
Although we're legally bound by attorney-client privilege, we know how Mr. Edelstein works and we know how to beat him.
You're right... strategically smart... but, you see, here's the thing:
I don't like you and I intend to go out of my way to never hire you.
Nice talking with you.
Look, Mr. Gross, little advice:
If you're looking for a good lawyer, don't go with who you like.
If I can irritate you like this, just think what I can do to your enemies.
I'm rich enough not to care.
ELI:
There were 12 campaign workers at the St. Martin, ten of them female.
Who's that?
Indira Starr, advance.
And she was at the hotel?
Yeah, why?
Kalinda, it is not true.
Peter did not sleep with her.
(door opens) PETER:
Eli...
I want you to look at this speech...
Hi, Peter.
ELI:
Peter, you know Kalinda Sharma?
Yes, in the State's Attorney's Office.
- Of course, yeah.
- She's helping us with, uh, Mandy Post.
Excuse me.
Uh, you want the photo?
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.
Sure.
(door closes)
You have her on this?
Yeah, why?
She wants to be on it?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Okay.
- What do I need to know here, Peter?
(sighs)
Nothing.
Let's go over this.
VIOLA:
You're reluctant to reveal the Chumhum algorithm to the court.
Why is that?
Well, for the obvious reason, it's our crown jewels.
Other companies would pay millions for access to it.
VIOLA:
And you're here to tell the court that you won't acquiesce to their subpoena,
- is that right?
- Yes, but I believe
I have the law on my side.
VIOLA:
Why is that?
- The First Amendment.
- WILL:
Oh, dear God.
JUDGE MARX:
Mr. Gardner.
Please.
Our search engine results are protected by free speech.
To compel their release is the same as compelling a newspaper to reveal its sources.
(Will chuckling)
VIOLA:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Therefore, you have editorial discretion, Mr. Gross?
Yes, and that is why I am resisting this subpoena.
Hey.
Hey.
- Kalinda, hello.
- NICK:
Hey.
This must be your friend.
Kalinda is it?
How are you doing?
I'm Nick.
He was just keeping me company.
Thrilling me with his accent.
Oh, I was trying to.
So how do you two know each other?
- Just friends.
- Really?
You seem like more.
Well, I don't know.
You seem like, uh, adopted sisters or something.
No.
Friends from way back.
Let me get you both a drink.
Friends.
Sure.
Oh, I've just got something through.
Sorry.
Will you excuse me, please?
I'm just gonna be one second.
Dyke.
Kevin Costas.
I'm a blogger.
My blog, UberTech, was awarded one of the Top 25 Tech Blogs of 2010 by Engadget.
Congratulations.
And on your blog you wrote:
"Margarita Motions wasn't just plagiarized... it stinks."
Yes.
And how do you know it was plagiarized?
KEVIN:
How do I know the software was?
Because it was.
'Cause it's not very good.
And you have proof they stole it?
You mean, actual proof?
No.
But I don't need it.
It's my opinion.
VIOLA:
Objection, Your Honor.
What does this have to do with the lawsuit?
ALICIA:
Mr. Gross is claiming editorial discretion for his search engine, therefore he is responsible for its editorial content...
- Wait a minute...
- They can't have their cake and eat it too, Your Honor.
If they insist on free speech protections, then they're responsible for that speech.
Your Honor...
No, Ms. Walsh, she's right.
Overruled.
So, Mr. Costas, you printed the accusation of plagiarism without checking truth or falsehood?
I didn't need to.
And did Mr. Gross, or anyone from Chumhum, ask you for evidence as to the truth of your accusation?
Uh... from Chumhum?
Uh, no.
Judge, this is absurd.
Chumhum has millions of pages.
If my client is gonna be held liable for every single one...
Well, then there will be a hell of a lot
- of defamation suits.
- Yes, Ms. Walsh.
I'm not making a free speech argument.
You are.
(sighs)
One million dollars.
But you have to take it now.
No consulting with Will.
No second guessing.
Just business between two like minds.
No.
- We're not going higher.
- That's probably true.
(sighs)
It's one million dollars.
This firm is bankrupt.
Then negotiate with Will.
Tell him.
But I'll advise him not to take it.
Why?
I've seen the evidence.
- You're a businessman.
- Yes.
Show a businessman a winning hand, he doesn't need to be a gambler to go all in.
I'm going all in.
Will has gotten to you.
He's put dollar signs in your eyes.
I'm trying to be the peacemaker here.
(laughs)
Why aren't people just upfront with what they want?
Why don't they ever just say what they mean?
Well, you have chosen a really strange time to get philosophical.
No.
It's the perfect time.
Thank you.
At first I was just... you know, flirtatious.
Older guys like to flirt with me.
- I have a nice laugh.
- And then you two had sex?
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.
I told that reporter, it's not like I'm some Rielle Hunter.
How many times did you have sex?
Maybe eight times.
I don't know.
Was it always at a hotel?
No, uh, twice at his apartment.
Once, we were doing it in the bedroom and we heard his wife coming home.
Yeah, it was like something out of a movie.
I had to hide in the bathroom.
She saw me, too.
She saw you?
- Alicia saw you?
- Yeah, Alicia.
But she said it was no big deal.
I mean, she's used to it.
I guess he's a real man whore.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
She was like, you can do it anywhere you want, just not in my apartment.
But you know how it is.
GROSS:
We are negotiating.
ALICIA:
Zero is not a negotiation.
GROSS:
Well, then throw out some numbers.
ALICIA:
Mr. Gross, settle down.
Sorry we're late.
Where are we at?
We seem to be at zero.
VIOLA:
Well, don't forget, we've agreed not to sue
- for court costs.
- Stop playing games, Viola.
It's settle or hand over the algorithm.
Mm... no.
I think there's a third way.
And what's that?
Have you spoken to your clients?
You're right.
I do tend to buy out my irritants.
Just not their lawyers.
Oh, Alicia, hi.
We were just leaving a note.
You settled?
Mr. Gross hired us to run Wicked Savage Designs for him.
Their voice recognition software.
What happened to running your own company?
Things change.
Thank you, Alicia.
You guys were great.
If we ever get in trouble again, we will give a call.
(sighs)
(chuckles)
ALICIA:
What do you need, Eli?
Eli?
Do you and Peter have an open marriage?
(giggling)
I'll take that as a no.
Take it any way you want.
We interviewed the campaign worker who supposedly slept with Peter and she said you have an open marriage.
- Well, I can't stop what Peter says.
- No.
She said you told her.
She said you found her in your apartment bathroom, hiding, and you told her not to worry about sleeping with Peter because you have an open marriage... just so long as it's not at your apartment.
This is all a lie?
Good.
Then that means this campaign worker isn't just lying about Peter.
She is also lying about you.

I don't know what you're getting on about this.
It isn't that hard.
I know you tried a lot of things when I was away, and I forgive you.
Thanks.
Yep.
But now I'm back.
And I don't want you doing anymore of that college dorm stuff.
No more... no more women.
Things change.
Some things don't change.
You belong to me.
I belong to you.
And I know where your girlfriend lives.
I'd like to see you try.

- Oh, I would.
She's a federal agent.
My girlfriend... is a federal agent.
So good luck with that.

Resync for WEB-DL by lost0ne
You went to the market, Huixiang?
Yup.
Bao is coming back for dinner tonight.
Is her hubby coming with her?
Hubby?
They aren't married yet.
Your younger sister should get married.
They've been going out for a long time.
Nan is a nice guy.
Quite a talent in drama, too.
Uncle Tai, you didn't know his mother...
...was a very popular...
Cantonese opera actress?
Of course I didn't know
We mostly did old tunes.
Like this one...
It's silent in the garden at midnight...
The night is tender and charming...
Being in the countryside of Moscow.
Blessed is the lady who will be his wife..
Can you fish in this low tide?
There're only stones!
Not a chance.
I'll leave it to fate.
If the fish is willing, we'll be very happy.
I'm just doing this to kill time.
Your sister and Nan are made for each other.
They both studied theatre.
Met each other immediately after graduation.
You're right.
Bao is really lucky.
Sister Huiniang!
You mustn't be so obstinate...
A girl without true love cannot live long...
But being killed ruthlessly is...
...too much of a tragedy.
Huiniang, life is nothing but an illusion.
Please stay put for a while.
You must understand this is...
...the fate of us concubines.
Sister Huiniang!
Are you alright, Nan?
Nothing.
Am)'
Honestly,
I was thinking of... casting two actresses to play the roles.
The pressure would have been too heavy for one actress plus the two characters have to appear in the same scene.
However, I think whoever is being casted... the two roles must be played by the same actress.
Pei falls for Zhaorong... because she looks exactly like Huiniang.
If the two roles were played...
...by two different actresses... you won't get the same impact.
Bao!
DO YOU agree?
Yes, you're right, of course.
No question about it.
Nonetheless my performance has to be matched by others'.
Your lines were all wrong.
There's no rhythm and emotion at all.
Jiangxian should be sympathetic with Huiniang.
You'll ruin the performance of your partners.
I'd say, as Director, shouldn't you... consider casting another actress for Bao's role?
It's still early.
We have time to adjust that.
Bao, you must work harder.
You must listen to Amy's opinions.
I'm glad that everyone thinks...
...this is a good script.
Don't waste this opportunity.
Try your best.
Thanks, Director.
Thanks, Ms. Amy.
I'll work harder.
Daydreaming again?
Are we going to dry read?
Easy!
Stop thinking about rehearsals!
What else should I think about?
Me!
For me?
Have you forgotten?
It's your birthday!
It's unimaginable for such...
...a small potato like me to be with you.
I'd say...
You are the best birthday present...
...from God to me.
I've got a flu.
You'll get infected.
Try this, Bao.
Do you find your sister's cookery...
...a bit too light?
Light?
Let me.
Not at all.
She makes the best food.
Agreed?
Absolutely.
You simply won't find such...
...tasty spicy cuttlefish anywhere.
You may come more often and eat with us.
No way.
The chili's bad for him.
As you can see, he's still coughing.
Bao knows Nan best.
These dishes are made for you at Mom's request.
Bao, aren't these your favourite dishes?
See, everyone tries to please you.
No way.
You're all poking fun at me.
Poking fun at you?
Put on the scarf.
It's a bit chilly here.
You have to protect your throat well.
Huixiang, aren't you bored by facing... all this darkness everyday?
No.
Look, there are ships passing, and they've got lights.
Nonetheless, at times...
I find it scary.
I just feel like... being sucked by all this darkness.
As if nothing has ever existed.
Just kidding!
Nan said he'd like to take a walk.
At this hour?
It's kind of late.
It's the cat!
Don't be afraid.
I told you I didn't want to come.
I don't care about your crickets.
Do you wanna stay at home with your mom?
Stop bentering with each other.
You should know very well that Bao's biggest fear... is darkness.
Please, no rats.
Am I such a coward?
Really?
See who'll get the crickets first?
Where are you going?
A rat!
Look at yourself!
You were laughing at Bao.
Happy birthday.
It comes in a pair.
I bought it for the two of you.
You bought it primarily for her.
If that's what you think, you may throw it away.
It's too dark here.
Much darker than the stage.
I think the opposite.
The stage is often very bright.
So bright that you can never see the audience.
Yes.
This has an advantage.
At least you won't feel nervous.
It won't ruin your performance.
You don't have to care about...
...how others would look at you.
You seem to be freer on stage.
Won't mind how others think of you.
One can also choose one's favourite part... to play when one's on stage... and play it as one likes.
That'll be heaven.
You can't play the way you like on stage.
You have partners, and a director.
Not to mention the playwright.
It's not as simple as you'd think.
Right...
How's your play, The Legend of the Plum Blossom, going?
It's okay.
It's just...
Bao is in trouble.
The director is very demanding.
The female lead is fussy, too.
Can I go watch your rehearsals?
It's okay if the answer is no.
I don't mean that.
We're still at the beginning.
You may come later when we dress rehearse.
Did you find any cricket?
No.
Did you find any cricket?
Didn't see any.
I'll look further.
Let's go, too.
Have you waited for long?
Oh...
You left this in my house.
No wonder.
I've just made another copy.
You have an extra copy?
May I have this?
You like it?
It's yours.
I've read this script for many times.
I particularly like the part of Zhaorong.
I was thrilled by the suicide scene.
It's okay.
Bao likes it a lot, too.
KK
What are you doing here?
No need to work today?
I'm free.
I have an easy day.
Those guys thought they could...
...cheat the insurance company by hiding.
Where's your sister?
Shopping.
What else?
Wanna eat together?
Am I intruding?
Will you mind, Bao?
I'm Huixiang!
Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Haven't seen you for a while
Sorry.
The tour will start next month.
We must work harder.
Let's rehearse the last scene.
Starting from the sequence in which Zhaorong imagines herself as Huiniang and returns to meet Peilang.
Ready?
Okay.
Let's start.
Okay.
If you keep thinking of that girl so much...
I'll help you fulfill your wish.
Despite the sadness caused by parting, love will ultimately turns to dust Huiniang!
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused...
...her to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Are you Huiniang?
I thought you had died three years ago.
Peilang, it was Zhaorong who'd died from lovesick.
I'm using her body to return to life.
It's me!
I'm Huiniang.
Huiniang has been dead for three years.
It's not possible for her to resurrect to life.
Isn't her, in fact, Zhaorong?
Is it you, Zhaorong?
Why was it like that?
Why did I speak of myself as Huiniang?
Did the fortune-teller predict rightly?
Huiniang's spirit is taking over my body...
...to rob Peilang from me?
Huiniang!
You're too impudent!
How dare you exploiting my body to seduce my Peilang?
Huiniang?
Is that you, Huiniang?
Huiniang?
Am I Huiniang?
I'm Huiniang?
Look at this.
A token from her.
She's been dead for three years.
Zhaorong, look.
Peilang always carries this token with him.
This is a proof of his love for me.
I beg you.
Please give up your body and fulfill our wish.
Zhaorong is really mad.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Huiniang...
Is this the token you used to seduce my Peilang?
I'll destroy it.
And let your homeless spirit wander around finally turning into ashes
No!
Peﬂang!
Do you love Huiniang... or Zhaorong?
I...
Of course I love you, Zhaorong.
If so, destroy the token to prove your love.
But this is the only thing Huiniang...
...left behind.
I can't afford to be so heartless as to destroy it.
Huiniang is like a plum blossom.
Zhaorong is like a peach blossom.
It'll be ruthless to choose...
...from either of them.
I love Zhaorong.
But I also love Huiniang.
I...
We've done it.
Done What?
You know what it is!
Nan?
...
He's alright.
He's a nice guy.
Your response to my having waited for three painful years is a mere "What a dilemma!"
Peﬂang!
You've broken my heart into pieces.
Alright, I'll help to fulfill the two of you.
Huiniang, this body of mine take it!
Bao!
What are you doing here?
Congratulations!
For what?
I wasn't the lead of the play.
I sincerely believe that one day you'll be the lead.
Huixiang...
Easy.
No one saw me.
How is Mom?
I've asked Mrs Li to take care of her.
Go home.
I'll do that after your final performance.
Bao got stage fright at the last performance!
She's not feeling well.
I'll go see her.
Are you alright?
When did you come?
It's been a while.
Are you thinking of replacing Bao?
Can I?
It takes years of hard work...
...to be able to perform.
Good acting can't be achieved...
...by merely watching.
Bao suggested me to replace her.
Why would a lady come here at this late hour?
Why would the scholar return to this place?
Greetings, my lady.
Greetings, Scholar.
Where did I meet you before?
May I know your...
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown make you think of someone?
Oh, I remember.
The lady on the bridge also wore such red gown.
Would you know the whereabouts of that lady?
She's... ."dead.
Dead?
Her coffin is inside this mansion.
How did she die?
She's disillusioned and there was an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
What actually happened?
The Prime Minister learned about...
...Huiniang's affair with you and beat her to death.
Poor Huiniang, she was calling your name before she died.
Huiniang!
This is the token she'd left you.
The token reminds me of her.
Love is ruthless.
My tears dropping on this handkerchief...
When will I reunion with my beloved?
Bao.
You were great.
Just listen to the applause!
Keep up the good work.
Thank you.
I'll change first.
I'm fine, Hai.
I'll go first.
How can you manage to perform in this state?
Let me replace you.
No.
You don't know any of the craft.
Can you afford to see yourself...
...replaced by others?
Why didn't you have more rest?
Where's Huixiang?
Sheleﬂ.
Why didn't you tell me about the swap?
Was she good?
How could she?
She's totally green.
She suggested to replace me herself.
It's just one last show anyway.
You should sleep more.
I have to go to the party later.
I'll go, too.
I almost didn't recognize you on the stage.
It's almost like you're reincarnated.
But I must point out a few mistakes.
Near the end of Act One, you almost tripped me.
Sorry for that.
I'll do better next time.
I'll go get a drink.
Why did you lie to me?
I didn't.
Those applauses were fake.
Why did they have to act...
...after the play was over?
What are you angry at?
She did you a favour, didn't she?
What's the point of all this?
Stop the car!
Slop!
I went to watch the second half of the play.
Huixiang was indeed better than me.
She's just an amateur.
Really?
You do think so?
You are lying.
If you are so pressured... you might as well quit.
You've wanted to say so for a long time.
I'll quit, then.
I like the smell of your body.
If I'm gone, what'd you do?
Why will you be gone?
A one and a two...
A one and a two...
How I wish there's only one me in this world.
Miss, any particular style you'd want?
Let me have a look at this.
Huixiang.
Come and help me pick.
Why the necklace?
Someone wants to make up for his mistakes.
I'll take this.
Are you sure you can't make it?
I'm sorry...
Don't you wanna see me?
I shouldn't come...
Where are you?
If you don't wanna see me...
I'll vanish.
You'll never see me again.
Drinking by yourself?
Why?
I'm by myself, that's why.
Don't drink too much.
I'll get changed.
What?
Dance with me.
Let's get married.
Why?
It's time we settle down.
We can settle down by getting married?
Have you made your choice?
What's that?
Let's talk at the back of the hill.
Huixiang?
Are you back?
Is it raining outside?
Huixiang, is it raining outside?
Did you get soaked?
I'm fine.
Mom.
Go to sleep.
Hello?
Where have you been?
I couldn't reach your mobile.
Have you forgotten the signing of the contract?
I'll come right now.
Huixiang...
Huixiang...
Are you back?
Have you forgotten your keys?
Mrs Lin, it's me.
I've come to bring you to dinner at our place.
See, she is like last time again.
Gone without leaving a single word...
Huixiang called me.
She said she was going away for...
...a few days for some business.
I'll take care of you.
Sorry to trouble you again, Mrs Li.
No problem, just adding an extra pair of chopsticks.
Did Huixiang tell you where she went?
No.
She didn't mention.
Here's Mrs Li.
She didn't even bring her mobile phone.
She's been away for five days.
Didn't even give me one call.
Will there be an accident?
No.
Did she mention where she was going?
No.
She just said she'd be away for a couple of days.
Shall we call the police?
Call the police?
It's not necessary.
Last time we were on tour she followed the troupe for almost a month.
She's most probably just out...
...on a trip by herself.
Let's wait for a few more days.
I agree.
Huixiang called me herself.
What's wrong, Mom?
Mom!
Come and stay with us for a couple of days.
Huixiang may return in a couple of days.
I don't want to trouble you.
Bao.
Why don't you come to stay with me?
Is that okay for you?
Didn't Bao say so?
Huixiang always disappeared...
...like that without a word.
I know.
This time I just felt... a bit weird.
The night Huixiang disappeared,
Bao didn't go home either.
The day after that I saw her...
I have a hunch...
Her forehead had a bruise.
Bao may have something to do...
...with Huixiang's disappearance.
Don't worry.
I'm free in the next few days.
I'll help you to find her.
Waiter!
Coming.
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Nan!
Nan!
Do you have something to tell me?
Is it possible that Huixiang has amnesia?
Finished.
Don't break it up.
Let me take a couple of more photos.
That was quite difficult.
It can't be amnesia.
She had called Mrs Li.
Why did you choose an all-white jigsaw?
You're awesome!
What's all this photographing?
Did you find anything?
This is Weird.
You said Huixiang called Mrs Li?
Then she should be fine.
I can only hope so.
But...
What?
Nan also mentioned that...
Huixiang had impersonated Bao once in Beijing and replaced Bao in a performance.
She was brilliant, too.
Bao was very upset by that.
I have the full picture now!
It's all jealousy!
Women's jealousy.
Jealousy...
It's terrible!
Jealousy kills, don't you know that?
It's very late now.
Do you know Huixiang's whereabouts?
How do I know?
You're right.
How would you know.
You miss her?
She's your sister.
Of course I do.
She's my sister, that's why you miss her.
I miss her, too.
Did you notice?
Every time we came home,
Huixiang wore this red dress.
Take a look.
Have you had enough?
This is funny?
She was very unstable in every performance.
And the blocking was always wrong.
But there's no denial that...
...Bao's getting better and better.
Well, I don't think so.
On the contrary, I think she's a bad influence to the troupe.
You're too far-fetched.
No matter what, replace her.
Otherwise...
I'll quit.
Amy...
Let me!
Amy!
Li Huiniang, what's my crime?
Jia Sidao!
As Prime Minister, you have failed your country.
You're obsessed with your wives and concubines.
War is imminent, yet you're not taking any action.
Li Huiniang!
You're insolent!
How dare you insult me?
I'll sentence you to death!
My Lord, be merciful!
Sis...
Amy!
Amy!
Amy...
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Quick, move away!
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Hurry!
Amy!
How is that?
Why are you always so unfocused?
The doctor said it'll at least...
...take a week for her to recover.
Lucky that there's no concussion.
We're running out of time.
What should we do?
She's been following...
...the production for a long time.
Maybe we can let her try.
You did it on purpose today.
What do you mean?
Are you really that eager to perform?
So much so that you'll do whatever you will?
You can say whatever you want.
Zhong!
Come, quick!
Something is floating there.
Looks like a body!
Mrs Lin!
Is Mrs Lin home?
Mrs Lin is home.
Who's that?
It's Zhong from the police station.
What's the matter?
Uncle Tai just found...
...an overcoat on the seaside.
I'd like you to take a look to see...
...if it's yours.
Why is it wet?
It was floating on the sea.
Does this belong to any member of your family?
No... this isn't Huixiang's.
I've heard Huixiang is not home...
...these past two days.
She had something to take care of.
That'll be fine.
If something happens, do call the police.
We'll deal with it immediately.
I know.
But since Huixiang's family didn't report the case we're not entitled to do anything.
I understand.
I passed by Huixiang's shop everyday.
It's almost a week that it's been closed.
Isn't there an Uncle Tai...
...who's very close with her?
Huixiang always chatted with him at the pier.
He should be having his break...
...at the tea restaurant now.
It's his habit.
Never miss a single day.
Old chaps are like that.
Did her sister ask you to look for her?
No, it's Nan.
He was here this morning.
Oh?
He asked me for the overcoat.
It's the one Uncle Tai...
...found on the seaside two days ago.
They thought it was Huixiang's.
We brought it to Huixiang's Mom.
But she denied it was hers.
She's very angry.
Isn't that her mom...
I know there is something wrong with her eyes.
But Nan also said the same when he saw it this morning.
That proved her Mom was correct.
Uncle Tai?
My name is Wang.
I saw you get off the boat.
You have good eyes.
This is my name card.
I heard you found an overcoat on the seaside.
Yes.
Why are you interested in it?
Nan is my good friend.
I'm tracing something for him.
I know Nan.
I told the police about the overcoat.
Nobody cared.
Does it look familiar?
Who have you seen wearing it.
Honestly, I'm not sure.
But it's not Huixiang's style.
This I'm pretty sure.
But it does look a bit familiar.
Mr.
How are you?
What?
Can I ask something?
Anything strange happened here?
I saw Huixiang going to the pier hurriedly on that morning.
Are you sure it was Huixiang?
I recognized Huixiang's clothes.
Boss.
Is it usually so quiet?
Boss?
It's particularly quiet lately.
Why?
It's that old theatre over there...
It's haunted.
You're quick.
You were just inside a second ago.
Everything reminds me of her.
I dreamt that she talked to me.
Huiniang!
The handkerchief...
It was a token of love.
Is it because I look like her that you...
It was my mistake to have loved you.
Peﬂang!
What's the difference...
...between you and Jia Sidao?
Great!
That's the way it is!
We'll continue tomorrow.
I was rehearsing.
Huixiang?
I'm Bao.
Sorry.
I'm wrong again, Bao.
I'll change first.
Excuse me.
I can't locate the cloth Zhaorong wears at the climactic scene.
Sorry... guess we'll fix another time.
Let me find again.
I'll call you for another appointment.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
You called her Huixiang deliberately, right?
Yup.
You really want to look for clues here?
You think it may upset the people here?
No one in the troupe knows she has a twin sister.
Best avoid that.
I see.
Nan have you found out that the overcoat the police discovered was Bao's?
Why didn't you tell me?
Me and Huixiang...
I see.
Are you suspecting the same?
I can't believe Huixiang could have killed Bao.
You said you saw Bao holding Huixiang's hairpin?
I know now!
The one you saw isn't Bao.
She's Huixiang.
Huixiang was passing herself off as Bao.
I had thought so, too.
But...
There's something weird.
Nan got confused, too.
He can't differentiate...
...between Huixiang and Bao.
If Huixiang really passes herself off as Bao he should have recognized.
After all, they've been together for some time.
Have a DNA examination!
Just a few thousand bucks.
So simple.
DNA of twins are identical.
It doesn't work.
This leaves only the fingerprints.
Do it, then.
It's not easy.
We need to have the fingerprints...
...of both persons for comparison.
It'll end up to nothing.
Are we stuck?
I've got it!
It's time for my entrance.
Brother Nan.
What are you doing here?
It's about Huixiang's disappearance.
My brother seems to be totally clueless.
That's why I'm here to check and see.
Nan, have you made sure yourself whether it's Huixiang or Bao that we're seeing?
I'm going to the back of the hill.
The back of the hill?
Why?
I'll go with you.
Fingerprints...
If we have some objects with Bao's fingerprints to to compare with those of her right now... we can easily find out the truth.
Right?
She had stayed in my house, too.
The fingerprints of both...
...must have mixed together.
It's very difficult to verify.
Is there some place she'd have gone only...
...by herself?
Let me think.
I will, too.
I'd like to stay a bit longer.
Can you go down by yourself?
Sure.
Why would the scholar on the bridge return to this place?
Maybe it's harmless to meet him.
Greetings, Scholar.
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown remind you of someone?
She's... dead.
She's disillusioned and...
...this caused an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
Please come in.
I'll be ready in a minute.
This is for you.
Put it on and see if it fits.
I've missed you.
If there was no Bao will you be with me?
...Nan told me about...
...the disappearance of Huixiang.
I'm here to gather some clues.
It's very quiet here.
Very quiet, indeed.
At times it makes you feel scary.
It's disturbing.
Fan...
Do you know why I didn't report to the police about Huixiang after all these days?
Why?
I think it's Bao, and not Huixiang, who's staying with me now.
They have different scent.
But...
I must say I'm not at all sure.
Because at time I smelled Huixiang...
Seems like she's nearby.
It may sound absurd.
Before I lost my sight I couldn't differentiate between them.
They liked to swap cloths to fool me...
...when they were young.
It was at those times that...
...I was completely confused about the two... of them.
Luckily I was able to...
...finish Zhaorong's dress in time.
I lost the original.
The director was mad at me.
Just be more careful.
Lots of unfortunate things have happened.
Huixiang has...
Watch out.
There was Uncle Song...
...who died inside the seaside motel.
The body was discovered only...
...after more than ten days.
Poor chap!
More than ten days!
With this weather, the smell must be awful!
True.
We dare not walk near the place.
A haunted house no one dares go near...
Why is there light?
Fan...
I have the whole picture now.
What do you mean?
Didn't you say when you...
...were at the troupe earlier... someone told you that Bao...
...was seen in the props room but was spotted at the gate...
...in the next brink?
So what?
I'll have to go to the island for more clues.
Hey!
What?
Don't go alone.
There's nothing I can do...
...if something happens to you.
Stop Worrying.
I'm not a kid any more.
Hey...
What again?
The report on the fingerprints has been issued.
What does it say?
There were two sets of fingerprints...
...on the hairpin.
One of them was identical with...
...that on the tape recorder.
The hairpin belongs to Huixiang.
That means...
Yup.
That proves my assumption.
Eat something.
What happened the other night?
I'm asking you!
What the hell happened?
Let go to the back of the hill and talk.
You and Nan... ls there something going on...
...that I'm not aware of?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
Stop asking.
Let's find a shelter.
It's alright.
The thunder will pass.
Huixiang...
Why do you have to do this to me?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
As long as you believe...
...isn't that good enough?
Let's concentrate on tonight's performance...
...first.
Okay?
Fan...
What happened?
How did you find out I'm here?
You texted me.
Not me.
It must be Huixiang.
Huixiang?
She tied me up here.
Where's she?
Dunno.
She said something like...
Bao is the female lead for...
...the first time tonight.
Female lead?
I'm Nan, please leave a message.
Shit!
I hope I didn't regain consciousness.
Why?
Thank God you're still alive.
Otherwise, Bao and all of us will be heart-broken.
Bao is the lead for the first time...
...in tonight's show.
The mountain is bidding farewell to the sun.
The moon's reflection is bathing in the lake.
The breeze is stirring up my sadness.
Separated from the outside world...
I was held captive in desertion.
I was suffering great pain...
Even in my dreams I found myself...
...trapped in a dead-end.
Nan found Bao's hairpin in the hills.
This proves that they were there.
But how come they were out on the sea?
Did Huixiang mention this to you?
Yes.
Do you remember our childhood days when Jun and all of us went sailing on a stolen boat?
How I've missed those simple days.
I recall the time...
...when I almost fell into the sea.
It was you who saved me.
Is that so?
I have forgotten.
Huixiang...
Let's steal a boat and go sailing.
Honestly, you and Nan...
Look!
What a lovely sky!
Look at it!
It's so beautiful.
No.
I won't.
Huixiang!
I must make sure what's going on among us.
Bao, there are certain things that should remain unscathed.
No.
No.
I must make sure of them.
If that's the case, things will come to an end.
I don't care.
Even if the result is disastrous, I have to do that.
Do you know what he likes best?
Do you know where his erogenous zones lie?
Pervert!
If you don't know, what exactly do you want to make sure?
I know!
I know!
Why is he Nan?
Why?
There's one more thing you should know, too.
That is, you're a rotten actor.
And a rotten girlfriend, too.
Bullshit!
It's bullshit!
Bao...!
Huixiang...
Save me, Huixiang...
Bao!
Come, come!
You wanna drown me?
You want me dead!
You are sick!
Bao!
Bao!
Bao!
Did Huixiang explain why she didn't go home?
She remained unconscious...
...in the sea for a while.
But she was choked and came back...
...to life by the water.
She held herself to the boat and made sure Bao went ashore before she swam back.
Bao's clothes were all soaked.
She changed in Huixiang's clothes and left.
The person whom Uncle Tai...
...saw the other morning was in fact Bao.
But things just happened...
...too suddenly and horribly.
According to Huixiang's personality... she'd be totally clueless in facing Bao.
That's why she was afraid to go home.
I see now.
She must have hidden inside the old theatre.
Didn't you mention that there were...
...signs of people staying there?
Right.
I bumped into her hiding place.
That's why she had to find another place.
Intermission for 5 minutes.
One thing keeps bugging me.
Why didn't Bao say anything...
...about what happened on that night?
Did she really think she had killed Huixiang?
It might have been like that...
She found out soon that...
...Huixiang was still alive.
Because Mrs Li from the next door...
...received a call from Huixiang.
Didn't Bao make that call?
I had thought so.
But it was actually Huixiang who called.
Do you mean she had known...
...that Huixiang was alive?
Exactly.
That's why she objected to calling the police.
She even went to Huixiang's hiding place.
Not so fast, bro.
But why did she hide the fact that Huixiang was alive?
Difficult to fathom.
Maybe it was deliberate.
She may want to know...
...what Huixiang really wants?
I yearned for you...
And had waited in vain...
The parting three years ago...
...languished in my memory.
There wasn't a single night...
...I didn't find myself in tears.
Peilang...
You're the cause for...
...all these unbearable torments!
I was on the battlefield for three years...
This token has stayed with me all the time.
I wonder if I could have persisted without it.
My dearest Huiniang!
How I have missed and longed for you!
No!
If I have returned to meet Zhaorong...
I shouldn't have indulged myself...
...in Huiniang's memory.
She's dead and that's that.
To do that is simply unfair to Zhaorong.
No.
I must not do that.
But Huiniang died because of me.
How could I be so heartless in forgetting her and destroying the token?
Huiniang my beloved!
How I've missed you!
Peilang, my Peilang!
I have waited three long hard years in vain!
Huiniang is the Woman who...
...has been occupying your thoughts!
If, indeed, that is the case...
Fine!
You'll have my blessing.
Despite the sadness caused by parting love will ultimately turns into dust.
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused her...
...to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Aren't you Huiniang?
Weren't you dead three years ago?
Peilang, Zhaorong has fallen to lovesickness.
I'm borrowing her body to reincarnate.
What?
Zhaorong's dead?
Zhaorong's dead.
I'm Huiniang.
Huilang?
Are you Huiniang?
So we finally meet!
Huiniang's been dead for three years.
How is it possible to have a reincarnation?
Moreover...
The maid has just asked her to come forward.
Is she indeed Zhaorong instead?
Zhaorong?
Is that you, Zhaorong?
Am I Zhaorong?
How could this be?
Why did I call myself Huiniang?
Has the fortune-teller predicted correctly?
Huiniang's ghost is returning to take away Peilang from me?
Has Zhaorong lost her mind from lovesickness?
What has happened?
Zhaorong has indeed gone mad.
She thinks she's Huiniang herself but morphs into Zhaorong's identity again.
Zhaorong!
Please help unite us together.
Fulfill my wish.
Let me live with him happily ever after.
Will you?
What...
But Why?
Don't you realize?
You're dead in his mind.
You shouldn't have returned to badger things.
Huiniang's dead.
The one you saw was just an illusion.
Let me ask you one thing.
Do you want her, or me?
I...
I love Zhaorong...
Yet I love Huiniang, too.
Stop making a victim of yourself.
I've had enough.
Aren't you dead?
Why did you return?
From the very beginning, this stage should have been my stage.
From the very beginning, there's no place for you..
You really hated me that much?
I hated you to death!
Everything's fine without you.
Why do you have to return?
Why?
Indeed...
Why did I return?
It's because I cannot afford to miss you.
Huixiang!
Please step outside.
Don't disturb us.
Go away!
Curtains!
Quick!
What are you looking at!
Call the ambulance!
Huixiang...
We're too late!
You went to the market, Huixiang?
Yup.
Bao is coming back for dinner tonight.
Is her hubby coming with her?
Hubby?
They aren't married yet.
Your younger sister should get married.
They've been going out for a long time.
Nan is a nice guy.
Quite a talent in drama, too.
Uncle Tai, you didn't know his mother...
...was a very popular Cantonese opera actress?
Of course I didn't know
We mostly did old tunes.
Like this one...
It's silent in the garden at midnight...
The night is tender and charming...
Being in the countryside of Moscow.
Blessed is the lady who will be his wife..
Can you fish in this low tide?
There're only stones!
Not a chance.
I'll leave it to fate.
If the fish is willing, we'll be very happy.
I'm just doing this to kill time.
Your sister and Nan are made for each other.
They both studied theatre.
Met each other immediately after graduation.
You're right.
Bao is really lucky.
Sister Huiniang!
You mustn't be so obstinate...
A girl without true love cannot live long...
But being killed ruthlessly is...
...too much of a tragedy.
Huiniang, life is nothing but an illusion.
Please stay put for a while.
You must understand this is...
...the fate of us concubines.
Sister Huiniang!
Are you alright, Nan?
Nothing.
Amy
Honestly,
I was thinking of casting two actresses to play the roles.
The pressure would have been too heavy for one actress plus the two characters have to appear in the same scene.
However, I think whoever is being casted the two roles must be played by the same actress.
Pei falls for Zhaorong because she looks exactly like Huiniang.
If the two roles were played...
...by two different actresses you won't get the same impact.
Bao!
Do you agree?
Yes, you're right, of course.
No question about it.
Nonetheless my performance has to be matched by others'.
Your lines were all wrong.
There's no rhythm and emotion at all.
Jiangxian should be sympathetic with Huiniang.
You'll ruin the performance of your partners.
I'd say, as Director, shouldn't you consider casting another actress for Bao's role?
It's still early.
We have time to adjust that.
Bao, you must work harder.
You must listen to Amy's opinions.
I'm glad that everyone thinks...
...this is a good script.
Don't waste this opportunity.
Try your best.
Thanks, Director.
Thanks, Ms. Amy.
I'll work harder.
Daydreaming again?
Are we going to dry read?
Easy!
Stop thinking about rehearsals!
What else should I think about?
Me!
For me?
Have you forgotten?
It's your birthday!
It's unimaginable for such...
...a small potato like me to be with you.
I'd say...
You are the best birthday present...
...from God to me.
I've got a flu.
You'll get infected.
Try this, Bao.
Do you find your sister's cookery...
...a bit too light?
Light?
Let me.
Not at all.
She makes the best food.
Agreed?
Absolutely.
You simply won't find such...
...tasty spicy cuttlefish anywhere.
You may come more often and eat with us.
No way.
The chili's bad for him.
As you can see, he's still coughing.
Bao knows Nan best.
These dishes are made for you at Mom's request.
Bao, aren't these your favourite dishes?
See, everyone tries to please you.
No way.
You're all poking fun at me.
Poking fun at you?
Put on the scarf.
It's a bit chilly here.
You have to protect your throat well.
Huixiang, aren't you bored by facing all this darkness everyday?
No.
Look, there are ships passing, and they've got lights.
Nonetheless, at times...
I find it scary.
I just feel like... being sucked by all this darkness.
As if nothing has ever existed.
Just kidding!
Nan said he'd like to take a walk.
At this hour?
It's kind of late.
It's the cat!
Don't be afraid.
I told you I didn't want to come.
I don't care about your crickets.
Do you wanna stay at home with your mom?
Stop bentering with each other.
You should know very well that Bao's biggest fear is darkness.
Please, no rats.
Am I such a coward?
Really?
See who'll get the crickets first?
Where are you going?
A rat!
Look at yourself!
You were laughing at Bao.
Happy birthday.
It comes in a pair.
I bought it for the two of you.
You bought it primarily for her.
If that's what you think, you may throw it away.
It's too dark here.
Much darker than the stage.
I think the opposite.
The stage is often very bright.
So bright that you can never see the audience.
Yes.
This has an advantage.
At least you won't feel nervous.
It won't ruin your performance.
You don't have to care about...
...how others would look at you.
You seem to be freer on stage.
Won't mind how others think of you.
One can also choose one's favourite part to play when one's on stage and play it as one likes.
That'll be heaven.
You can't play the way you like on stage.
You have partners, and a director.
Not to mention the playwright.
It's not as simple as you'd think.
Right...
How's your play, The Legend of the Plum Blossom, going?
It's okay.
It's just...
Bao is in trouble.
The director is very demanding.
The female lead is fussy, too.
Can I go watch your rehearsals?
It's okay if the answer is no.
I don't mean that.
We're still at the beginning.
You may come later when we dress rehearse.
Did you find any cricket?
No.
Did you find any cricket?
Didn't see any.
I'll look further.
Let's go, too.
Have you waited for long?
Oh...
You left this in my house.
No wonder.
I've just made another copy.
You have an extra copy?
May I have this?
You like it?
It's yours.
I've read this script for many times.
I particularly like the part of Zhaorong.
I was thrilled by the suicide scene.
It's okay.
Bao likes it a lot, too.
KK
What are you doing here?
No need to work today?
I'm free.
I have an easy day.
Those guys thought they could...
...cheat the insurance company by hiding.
Where's your sister?
Shopping.
What else?
Wanna eat together?
Am I intruding?
Will you mind, Bao?
I'm Huixiang!
Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Haven't seen you for a while
Sorry.
The tour will start next month.
We must work harder.
Let's rehearse the last scene.
Starting from the sequence in which Zhaorong imagines herself as Huiniang and returns to meet Peilang.
Ready?
Okay.
Let's start.
Okay.
If you keep thinking of that girl so much...
I'll help you fulfill your wish.
Despite the sadness caused by parting,
Iove will ultimately turns to dust Huiniang!
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused...
...her to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Are you Huiniang?
I thought you had died three years ago.
Peilang, it was Zhaorong who'd died from lovesick.
I'm using her body to return to life.
It's me!
I'm Huiniang.
Huiniang has been dead for three years.
It's not possible for her to resurrect to life.
Isn't her, in fact, Zhaorong?
Is it you, Zhaorong?
Why was it like that?
Why did I speak of myself as Huiniang?
Did the fortune-teller predict rightly?
Huiniang's spirit is taking over my body...
...to rob Peilang from me?
Huiniang!
You're too impudent!
How dare you exploiting my body to seduce my Peilang?
Huiniang?
Is that you, Huiniang?
Huiniang?
Am I Huiniang?
I'm Huiniang?
Look at this.
A token from her.
She's been dead for three years.
Zhaorong, look.
Peilang always carries this token with him.
This is a proof of his love for me.
I beg you.
Please give up your body and fulfill our wish.
Zhaorong is really mad.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Huiniang...
Is this the token you used to seduce my Peilang?
I'll destroy it.
And let your homeless spirit wander around finally turning into ashes
No!
Peilang!
Do you love Huiniang... or Zhaorong?
I...
Of course I love you, Zhaorong.
If so, destroy the token to prove your love.
But this is the only thing Huiniang...
...left behind.
I can't afford to be so heartless as to destroy it.
Huiniang is like a plum blossom.
Zhaorong is like a peach blossom.
It'll be ruthless to choose...
...from either of them.
I love Zhaorong.
But I also love Huiniang.
I...
We've done it.
Done what?
You know what it is!
Nan?
...
He's alright.
He's a nice guy.
Your response to my having waited for three painful years is a mere "What a dilemma!"
Peilang!
You've broken my heart into pieces.
Alright, I'll help to fulfill the two of you.
Huiniang, this body of mine take it!
Bao!
What are you doing here?
Congratulations!
For what?
I wasn't the lead of the play.
I sincerely believe that one day you'll be the lead.
Huixiang...
Easy.
No one saw me.
How is Mom?
I've asked Mrs Li to take care of her.
Go home.
I'll do that after your final performance.
Bao got stage fright at the last performance!
She's not feeling well.
I'll go see her.
Are you alright?
When did you come?
It's been a while.
Are you thinking of replacing Bao?
Can I?
It takes years of hard work...
...to be able to perform.
Good acting can't be achieved...
...by merely watching.
Bao suggested me to replace her.
Why would a lady come here at this late hour?
Why would the scholar return to this place?
Greetings, my lady.
Greetings, Scholar.
Where did I meet you before?
May I know your...
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown make you think of someone?
Oh, I remember.
The lady on the bridge also wore such red gown.
Would you know the whereabouts of that lady?
She's dead.
Dead?
Her coffin is inside this mansion.
How did she die?
She's disillusioned and there was an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
What actually happened?
The Prime Minister learned about...
...Huiniang's affair with you and beat her to death.
Poor Huiniang, she was calling your name before she died.
Huiniang!
This is the token she'd left you.
The token reminds me of her.
Love is ruthless.
My tears dropping on this handkerchief...
When will I reunion with my beloved?
Bao.
You were great.
Just listen to the applause!
Keep up the good work.
Thank you.
I'll change first.
I'm fine, Hai.
I'll go first.
How can you manage to perform in this state?
Let me replace you.
No.
You don't know any of the craft.
Can you afford to see yourself...
...replaced by others?
Why didn't you have more rest?
Where's Huixiang?
She left.
Why didn't you tell me about the swap?
Was she good?
How could she?
She's totally green.
She suggested to replace me herself.
It's just one last show anyway.
You should sleep more.
I have to go to the party later.
I'll go, too.
I almost didn't recognize you on the stage.
It's almost like you're reincarnated.
But I must point out a few mistakes.
Near the end of Act One, you almost tripped me.
Sorry for that.
I'll do better next time.
I'll go get a drink.
Why did you lie to me?
I didn't.
Those applauses were fake.
Why did they have to act...
...after the play was over?
What are you angry at?
She did you a favour, didn't she?
What's the point of all this?
Stop the car!
Stop!
I went to watch the second half of the play.
Huixiang was indeed better than me.
She's just an amateur.
Really?
You do think so?
You are lying.
If you are so pressured you might as well quit.
You've wanted to say so for a long time.
I'll quit, then.
I like the smell of your body.
If I'm gone, what'd you do?
Why will you be gone?
A one and a two...
A one and a two...
How I wish there's only one me in this world.
Miss, any particular style you'd want?
Let me have a look at this.
Huixiang.
Come and help me pick.
Why the necklace?
Someone wants to make up for his mistakes.
I'll take this.
Are you sure you can't make it?
I'm sorry...
Don't you wanna see me?
I shouldn't come...
Where are you?
If you don't wanna see me...
I'll vanish.
You'll never see me again.
Drinking by yourself?
Why?
I'm by myself, that's why.
Don't drink too much.
I'll get changed.
What?
Dance with me.
Let's get married.
Why?
It's time we settle down.
We can settle down by getting married?
Have you made your choice?
What's that?
Let's talk at the back of the hill.
Huixiang?
Are you back?
Is it raining outside?
Huixiang, is it raining outside?
Did you get soaked?
I'm fine.
Mom.
Go to sleep.
Hello?
Where have you been?
I couldn't reach your mobile.
Have you forgotten the signing of the contract?
I'll come right now.
Huixiang...
Huixiang...
Are you back?
Have you forgotten your keys?
Mrs Lin, it's me.
I've come to bring you to dinner at our place.
See, she is like last time again.
Gone without leaving a single word...
Huixiang called me.
She said she was going away for...
...a few days for some business.
I'll take care of you.
Sorry to trouble you again, Mrs Li.
No problem, just adding an extra pair of chopsticks.
Did Huixiang tell you where she went?
No.
She didn't mention.
Here's Mrs Li.
She didn't even bring her mobile phone.
She's been away for five days.
Didn't even give me one call.
Will there be an accident?
No.
Did she mention where she was going?
No.
She just said she'd be away for a couple of days.
Shall we call the police?
Call the police?
It's not necessary.
Last time we were on tour she followed the troupe for almost a month.
She's most probably just out...
...on a trip by herself.
Let's wait for a few more days.
I agree.
Huixiang called me herself.
What's wrong, Mom?
Mom!
Come and stay with us for a couple of days.
Huixiang may return in a couple of days.
I don't want to trouble you.
Bao.
Why don't you come to stay with me?
Is that okay for you?
Didn't Bao say so?
Huixiang always disappeared...
...like that without a word.
I know.
This time I just felt a bit weird.
The night Huixiang disappeared,
Bao didn't go home either.
The day after that I saw her...
I have a hunch...
Her forehead had a bruise.
Bao may have something to do...
...with Huixiang's disappearance.
Don't worry.
I'm free in the next few days.
I'll help you to find her.
Waiter!
Coming.
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Nan!
Nan!
Do you have something to tell me?
Is it possible that Huixiang has amnesia?
Finished.
Don't break it up.
Let me take a couple of more photos.
That was quite difficult.
It can't be amnesia.
She had called Mrs Li.
Why did you choose an all-white jigsaw?
You're awesome!
What's all this photographing?
Did you find anything?
This is weird.
You said Huixiang called Mrs Li?
Then she should be fine.
I can only hope so.
But...
What?
Nan also mentioned that...
Huixiang had impersonated Bao once in Beijing and replaced Bao in a performance.
She was brilliant, too.
Bao was very upset by that.
I have the full picture now!
It's all jealousy!
Women's jealousy.
Jealousy...
It's terrible!
Jealousy kills, don't you know that?
It's very late now.
Do you know Huixiang's whereabouts?
How do I know?
You're right.
How would you know.
You miss her?
She's your sister.
Of course I do.
She's my sister, that's why you miss her.
I miss her, too.
Did you notice?
Every time we came home,
Huixiang wore this red dress.
Take a look.
Have you had enough?
This is funny?
She was very unstable in every performance.
And the blocking was always wrong.
But there's no denial that...
...Bao's getting better and better.
Well, I don't think so.
On the contrary, I think she's a bad influence to the troupe.
You're too far-fetched.
No matter what, replace her.
Otherwise...
I'll quit.
Amy...
Let me!
Amy!
Li Huiniang, what's my crime?
Jia Sidao!
As Prime Minister, you have failed your country.
You're obsessed with your wives and concubines.
War is imminent, yet you're not taking any action.
Li Huiniang!
You're insolent!
How dare you insult me?
I'll sentence you to death!
My Lord, be merciful!
Sis...
Amy!
Amy!
Amy...
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Quick, move away!
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Hurry!
Amy!
How is that?
Why are you always so unfocused?
The doctor said it'll at least...
...take a week for her to recover.
Lucky that there's no concussion.
We're running out of time.
What should we do?
She's been following...
...the production for a long time.
Maybe we can let her try.
You did it on purpose today.
What do you mean?
Are you really that eager to perform?
So much so that you'll do whatever you will?
You can say whatever you want.
Zhong!
Come, quick!
Something is floating there.
Looks like a body!
Mrs Lin!
Is Mrs Lin home?
Mrs Lin is home.
Who's that?
It's Zhong from the police station.
What's the matter?
Uncle Tai just found...
...an overcoat on the seaside.
I'd like you to take a look to see...
...if it's yours.
Why is it wet?
It was floating on the sea.
Does this belong to any member of your family?
No... this isn't Huixiang's.
I've heard Huixiang is not home...
...these past two days.
She had something to take care of.
That'll be fine.
If something happens, do call the police.
We'll deal with it immediately.
I know.
But since Huixiang's family didn't report the case we're not entitled to do anything.
I understand.
I passed by Huixiang's shop everyday.
It's almost a week that it's been closed.
Isn't there an Uncle Tai...
...who's very close with her?
Huixiang always chatted with him at the pier.
He should be having his break...
...at the tea restaurant now.
It's his habit.
Never miss a single day.
Old chaps are like that.
Did her sister ask you to look for her?
No, it's Nan.
He was here this morning.
Oh?
He asked me for the overcoat.
It's the one Uncle Tai...
...found on the seaside two days ago.
They thought it was Huixiang's.
We brought it to Huixiang's Mom.
But she denied it was hers.
She's very angry.
Isn't that her mom...
I know there is something wrong with her eyes.
But Nan also said the same when he saw it this morning.
That proved her Mom was correct.
Uncle Tai?
My name is Wang.
I saw you get off the boat.
You have good eyes.
This is my name card.
I heard you found an overcoat on the seaside.
Yes.
Why are you interested in it?
Nan is my good friend.
I'm tracing something for him.
I know Nan.
I told the police about the overcoat.
Nobody cared.
Does it look familiar?
Who have you seen wearing it.
Honestly, I'm not sure.
But it's not Huixiang's style.
This I'm pretty sure.
But it does look a bit familiar.
Mr....
How are you?
What?
Can I ask something?
Anything strange happened here?
I saw Huixiang going to the pier hurriedly on that morning.
Are you sure it was Huixiang?
I recognized Huixiang's clothes.
Boss.
Is it usually so quiet?
Boss?
It's particularly quiet lately.
Why?
It's that old theatre over there...
It's haunted.
You're quick.
You were just inside a second ago.
Everything reminds me of her.
I dreamt that she talked to me.
Huiniang!
The handkerchief...
It was a token of love.
Is it because I look like her that you...
It was my mistake to have loved you.
Peilang!
What's the difference...
...between you and Jia Sidao?
Great!
That's the way it is!
We'll continue tomorrow.
I was rehearsing.
Huixiang?
I'm Bao.
Sorry.
I'm wrong again, Bao.
I'll change first.
Excuse me.
I can't locate the cloth Zhaorong wears at the climactic scene.
Sorry... guess we'll fix another time.
Let me find again.
I'll call you for another appointment.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
You called her Huixiang deliberately, right?
Yup.
You really want to look for clues here?
You think it may upset the people here?
No one in the troupe knows she has a twin sister.
Best avoid that.
I see.
Nan have you found out that the overcoat the police discovered was Bao's?
Why didn't you tell me?
Me and Huixiang...
I see.
Are you suspecting the same?
I can't believe Huixiang could have killed Bao.
You said you saw Bao holding Huixiang's hairpin?
I know now!
The one you saw isn't Bao.
She's Huixiang.
Huixiang was passing herself off as Bao.
I had thought so, too.
But...
There's something weird.
Nan got confused, too.
He can't differentiate...
...between Huixiang and Bao.
If Huixiang really passes herself off as Bao he should have recognized.
After all, they've been together for some time.
Have a DNA examination!
Just a few thousand bucks.
So simple.
DNA of twins are identical.
It doesn't work.
This leaves only the fingerprints.
Do it, then.
It's not easy.
We need to have the fingerprints...
...of both persons for comparison.
It'll end up to nothing.
Are we stuck?
I've got it!
It's time for my entrance.
Brother Nan.
What are you doing here?
It's about Huixiang's disappearance.
My brother seems to be totally clueless.
That's why I'm here to check and see.
Nan, have you made sure yourself whether it's Huixiang or Bao that we're seeing?
I'm going to the back of the hill.
The back of the hill?
Why?
I'll go with you.
Fingerprints...
If we have some objects with Bao's fingerprints to to compare with those of her right now we can easily find out the truth.
Right?
She had stayed in my house, too.
The fingerprints of both...
...must have mixed together.
It's very difficult to verify.
Is there some place she'd have gone only...
...by herself?
Let me think.
I will, too.
I'd like to stay a bit longer.
Can you go down by yourself?
Sure.
Why would the scholar on the bridge return to this place?
Maybe it's harmless to meet him.
Greetings, Scholar.
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown remind you of someone?
She's... dead.
She's disillusioned and...
...this caused an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
Please come in.
I'll be ready in a minute.
This is for you.
Put it on and see if it fits.
I've missed you.
If there was no Bao will you be with me?
...Nan told me about...
...the disappearance of Huixiang.
I'm here to gather some clues.
It's very quiet here.
Very quiet, indeed.
At times it makes you feel scary.
It's disturbing.
Fan...
Do you know why I didn't report to the police about Huixiang after all these days?
Why?
I think it's Bao, and not Huixiang, who's staying with me now.
They have different scent.
But...
I must say I'm not at all sure.
Because at time I smelled Huixiang...
Seems like she's nearby.
It may sound absurd.
Before I lost my sight I couldn't differentiate between them.
They liked to swap cloths to fool me...
...when they were young.
It was at those times that...
...I was completely confused about the two of them.
Luckily I was able to...
...finish Zhaorong's dress in time.
I lost the original.
The director was mad at me.
Just be more careful.
Lots of unfortunate things have happened.
Huixiang has...
Watch out.
There was Uncle Song...
...who died inside the seaside motel.
The body was discovered only...
...after more than ten days.
Poor chap!
More than ten days!
With this weather, the smell must be awful!
True.
We dare not walk near the place.
A haunted house no one dares go near...
Why is there light?
Fan...
I have the whole picture now.
What do you mean?
Didn't you say when you...
...were at the troupe earlier someone told you that Bao...
...was seen in the props room but was spotted at the gate...
...in the next brink?
So what?
I'll have to go to the island for more clues.
Hey!
What?
Don't go alone.
There's nothing I can do...
...if something happens to you.
Stop worrying.
I'm not a kid anymore.
Hey...
What again?
The report on the fingerprints has been issued.
What does it say?
There were two sets of fingerprints...
...on the hairpin.
One of them was identical with...
...that on the tape recorder.
The hairpin belongs to Huixiang.
That means...
Yup.
That proves my assumption.
Eat something.
What happened the other night?
I'm asking you!
What the hell happened?
Let go to the back of the hill and talk.
You and Nan...
Is there something going on...
...that I'm not aware of?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
Stop asking.
Let's find a shelter.
It's alright.
The thunder will pass.
Huixiang...
Why do you have to do this to me?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
As long as you believe...
...isn't that good enough?
Let's concentrate on tonight's performance...
...first.
Okay?
Fan...
What happened?
How did you find out I'm here?
You texted me.
Not me.
It must be Huixiang.
Huixiang?
She tied me up here.
Where's she?
Dunno.
She said something like...
Bao is the female lead for...
...the first time tonight.
Female lead?
I'm Nan, please leave a message.
Shit!
I hope I didn't regain consciousness.
Why?
Thank God you're still alive.
Otherwise, Bao and all of us will be heart-broken.
Bao is the lead for the first time...
...in tonight's show.
The mountain is bidding farewell to the sun.
The moon's reflection is bathing in the lake.
The breeze is stirring up my sadness.
Separated from the outside world...
I was held captive in desertion.
I was suffering great pain...
Even in my dreams I found myself...
...trapped in a dead-end.
Nan found Bao's hairpin in the hills.
This proves that they were there.
But how come they were out on the sea?
Did Huixiang mention this to you?
Yes.
Do you remember our childhood days when Jun and all of us went sailing on a stolen boat?
How I've missed those simple days.
I recall the time...
...when I almost fell into the sea.
It was you who saved me.
Is that so?
I have forgotten.
Huixiang...
Let's steal a boat and go sailing.
Honestly, you and Nan...
Look!
What a lovely sky!
Look at it!
It's so beautiful.
No.
I won't.
Huixiang!
I must make sure what's going on among us.
Bao, there are certain things that should remain unscathed.
No.
No.
I must make sure of them.
If that's the case, things will come to an end.
I don't care.
Even if the result is disastrous, I have to do that.
Do you know what he likes best?
Do you know where his erogenous zones lie?
Pervert!
If you don't know, what exactly do you want to make sure?
I know!
I know!
Why is he Nan?
Why?
There's one more thing you should know, too.
That is, you're a rotten actor.
And a rotten girlfriend, too.
Bullshit!
It's bullshit!
Bao...!
Huixiang...
Save me, Huixiang...
Bao!
Come, come!
You wanna drown me?
You want me dead!
You are sick!
Bao!
Bao!
Bao!
Did Huixiang explain why she didn't go home?
She remained unconscious...
...in the sea for a while.
But she was choked and came back...
...to life by the water.
She held herself to the boat and made sure Bao went ashore before she swam back.
Bao's clothes were all soaked.
She changed in Huixiang's clothes and left.
The person whom Uncle Tai...
...saw the other morning was in fact Bao.
But things just happened...
...too suddenly and horribly.
According to Huixiang's personality she'd be totally clueless in facing Bao.
That's why she was afraid to go home.
I see now.
She must have hidden inside the old theatre.
Didn't you mention that there were...
...signs of people staying there?
Right.
I bumped into her hiding place.
That's why she had to find another place.
Intermission for 5 minutes.
One thing keeps bugging me.
Why didn't Bao say anything...
...about what happened on that night?
Did she really think she had killed Huixiang?
It might have been like that...
She found out soon that...
...Huixiang was still alive.
Because Mrs Li from the next door...
...received a call from Huixiang.
Didn't Bao make that call?
I had thought so.
But it was actually Huixiang who called.
Do you mean she had known...
...that Huixiang was alive?
Exactly.
That's why she objected to calling the police.
She even went to Huixiang's hiding place.
Not so fast, bro.
But why did she hide the fact that Huixiang was alive?
Difficult to fathom.
Maybe it was deliberate.
She may want to know...
...what Huixiang really wants?
I yearned for you...
And had waited in vain...
The parting three years ago...
...Ianguished in my memory.
There wasn't a single night...
...I didn't find myself in tears.
Peilang...
You're the cause for...
...all these unbearable torments!
I was on the battlefield for three years...
This token has stayed with me all the time.
I wonder if I could have persisted without it.
My dearest Huiniang!
How I have missed and longed for you!
No!
If I have returned to meet Zhaorong...
I shouldn't have indulged myself...
...in Huiniang's memory.
She's dead and that's that.
To do that is simply unfair to Zhaorong.
No.
I must not do that.
But Huiniang died because of me.
How could I be so heartless in forgetting her and destroying the token?
Huiniang my beloved!
How I've missed you!
Peilang, my Peilang!
I have waited three long hard years in vain!
Huiniang is the woman who...
...has been occupying your thoughts!
If, indeed, that is the case...
Fine!
You'll have my blessing.
Despite the sadness caused by parting Iove will ultimately turns into dust.
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused her...
...to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Aren't you Huiniang?
Weren't you dead three years ago?
Peilang, Zhaorong has fallen to lovesickness.
I'm borrowing her body to reincarnate.
What?
Zhaorong's dead?
Zhaorong's dead.
I'm Huiniang.
Huilang?
Are you Huiniang?
So we finally meet!
Huiniang's been dead for three years.
How is it possible to have a reincarnation?
Moreover...
The maid has just asked her to come forward.
Is she indeed Zhaorong instead?
Zhaorong?
Is that you, Zhaorong?
Am I Zhaorong?
How could this be?
Why did I call myself Huiniang?
Has the fortune-teller predicted correctly?
Huiniang's ghost is returning to take away Peilang from me?
Has Zhaorong lost her mind from lovesickness?
What has happened?
Zhaorong has indeed gone mad.
She thinks she's Huiniang herself but morphs into Zhaorong's identity again.
Zhaorong!
Please help unite us together.
Fulfill my wish.
Let me live with him happily ever after.
Will you?
What...
But why?
Don't you realize?
You're dead in his mind.
You shouldn't have returned to badger things.
Huiniang's dead.
The one you saw was just an illusion.
Let me ask you one thing.
Do you want her, or me?
I...
I love Zhaorong...
Yet I love Huiniang, too.
Stop making a victim of yourself.
I've had enough.
Aren't you dead?
Why did you return?
From the very beginning, this stage should have been my stage.
From the very beginning, there's no place for you..
You really hated me that much?
I hated you to death!
Everything's fine without you.
Why do you have to return?
Why?
Indeed...
Why did I return?
It's because I cannot afford to miss you.
Huixiang!
Please step outside.
Don't disturb us.
Go away!
Curtains!
Quick!
What are you looking at!
Call the ambulance!
Huixiang...
We're too late!
You went to the market, Huixiang?
Yup.
Bao is coming back for dinner tonight.
Is her hubby coming with her?
Hubby?
They aren't married yet.
Your younger sister should get married.
They've been going out for a long time.
Nan is a nice guy.
Quite a talent in drama, too.
Uncle Tai, you didn't know his mother...
...was a very popular...
Cantonese opera actress?
Of course I didn't know
We mostly did old tunes.
Like this one...
It's silent in the garden at midnight...
The night is tender and charming...
Being in the countryside of Moscow.
Blessed is the lady who will be his wife..
Can you fish in this low tide?
There're only stones!
Not a chance.
I'll leave it to fate.
If the fish is willing, we'll be very happy.
I'm just doing this to kill time.
Your sister and Nan are made for each other.
They both studied theatre.
Met each other immediately after graduation.
You're right.
Bao is really lucky.
Sister Huiniang!
You mustn't be so obstinate...
A girl without true love cannot live long...
But being killed ruthlessly is...
...too much of a tragedy.
Huiniang, life is nothing but an illusion.
Please stay put for a while.
You must understand this is...
...the fate of us concubines.
Sister Huiniang!
Are you alright, Nan?
Nothing.
Amy
Honestly,
I was thinking of... casting two actresses to play the roles.
The pressure would have been too heavy for one actress plus the two characters have to appear in the same scene.
However, I think whoever is being casted... the two roles must be played by the same actress.
Pei falls for Zhaorong... because she looks exactly like Huiniang.
If the two roles were played...
...by two different actresses... you won't get the same impact.
Bao!
Do YOU agree?
Yes, you're right, of course.
No question about it.
Nonetheless my performance has to be matched by others'.
Your lines were all wrong.
There's no rhythm and emotion at all.
Jiangxian should be sympathetic with Huiniang.
You'll ruin the performance of your partners.
I'd say, as Director, shouldn't you... consider casting another actress for Bao's role?
It's still early.
We have time to adjust that.
Bao, you must work harder.
You must listen to Amy's opinions.
I'm glad that everyone thinks...
...this is a good script.
Don't waste this opportunity.
Try your best.
Thanks, Director.
Thanks, Ms. Amy.
I'll work harder.
Daydreaming again?
Are we going to dry read?
Easy!
Stop thinking about rehearsals!
What else should I think about?
Me!
For me?
Have you forgotten?
It's your birthday!
It's unimaginable for such...
...a small potato like me to be with you.
I'd say...
You are the best birthday present...
...from God to me.
I've got a flu.
You'll get infected.
Try this, Bao.
Do you find your sister's cookery...
...a bit too light?
Light?
Let me.
Not at all.
She makes the best food.
Agreed?
Absolutely.
You simply won't find such...
...tasty spicy cuttlefish anywhere.
You may come more often and eat with us.
No way.
The chili's bad for him.
As you can see, he's still coughing.
Bao knows Nan best.
These dishes are made for you at Mom's request.
Bao, aren't these your favourite dishes?
See, everyone tries to please you.
No way.
You're all poking fun at me.
Poking fun at you?
Put on the scarf.
It's a bit chilly here.
You have to protect your throat well.
Huixiang, aren't you bored by facing... all this darkness everyday?
No.
Look, there are ships passing, and they've got lights.
Nonetheless, at times...
I find it scary.
I just feel like... being sucked by all this darkness.
As if nothing has ever existed.
Just kidding!
Nan said he'd like to take a walk.
At this hour?
It's kind of late.
It's the cat!
Don't be afraid.
I told you I didn't want to come.
I don't care about your crickets.
Do you wanna stay at home with your mom?
Stop bentering with each other.
You should know very well that Bao's biggest fear... is darkness.
Please, no rats.
Am I such a coward?
Really?
See who'll get the crickets first?
Where are you going?
A rat!
Look at yourself!
You were laughing at Bao.
Happy birthday.
It comes in a pair.
I bought it for the two of you.
You bought it primarily for her.
If that's what you think, you may throw it away.
It's too dark here.
Much darker than the stage.
I think the opposite.
The stage is often very bright.
So bright that you can never see the audience.
Yes.
This has an advantage.
At least you won't feel nervous.
It won't ruin your performance.
You don't have to care about...
...how others would look at you.
You seem to be freer on stage.
Won't mind how others think of you.
One can also choose one's favourite part... to play when one's on stage... and play it as one likes.
That'll be heaven.
You can't play the way you like on stage.
You have partners, and a director.
Not to mention the playwright.
It's not as simple as you'd think.
Right...
How's your play, The Legend of the Plum Blossom, going?
It's okay.
It's just...
Bao is in trouble.
The director is very demanding.
The female lead is fussy, too.
Can I go watch your rehearsals?
It's okay if the answer is no.
I don't mean that.
We're still at the beginning.
You may come later when we dress rehearse.
Did you find any cricket?
No.
Did you find any cricket?
Didn't see any.
I'll look further.
Let's go, too.
Have you waited for long?
Oh...
You left this in my house.
No wonder.
I've just made another copy.
You have an extra copy?
May I have this?
You like it?
It's yours.
I've read this script for many times.
I particularly like the part of Zhaorong.
I was thrilled by the suicide scene.
It's okay.
Bao likes it a lot, too.
KK
What are you doing here?
No need to work today?
I'm free.
I have an easy day.
Those guys thought they could...
...cheat the insurance company by hiding.
Where's your sister?
Shopping.
What else?
Wanna eat together?
Am I intruding?
Will you mind, Bao?
I'm Huixiang!
Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Haven't seen you for a while
Sorry.
The tour will start next month.
We must work harder.
Let's rehearse the last scene.
Starting from the sequence in which Zhaorong imagines herself as Huiniang and returns to meet Peilang.
Ready?
Okay.
Let's start.
Okay.
If you keep thinking of that girl so much...
I'll help you fulfill your wish.
Despite the sadness caused by parting, love will ultimately turns to dust Huiniang!
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused...
...her to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Are you Huiniang?
I thought you had died three years ago.
Peilang, it was Zhaorong who'd died from lovesick.
I'm using her body to return to life.
It's me!
I'm Huiniang.
Huiniang has been dead for three years.
It's not possible for her to resurrect to life.
Isn't her, in fact, Zhaorong?
Is it you, Zhaorong?
Why was it like that?
Why did I speak of myself as Huiniang?
Did the fortune-teller predict rightly?
Huiniang's spirit is taking over my body...
...to rob Peilang from me?
Huiniang!
You're too impudent!
How dare you exploiting my body to seduce my Peilang?
Huiniang?
Is that you, Huiniang?
Huiniang?
Am I Huiniang?
I'm Huiniang?
Look at this.
A token from her.
She's been dead for three years.
Zhaorong, look.
Peilang always carries this token with him.
This is a proof of his love for me.
I beg you.
Please give up your body and fulfill our wish.
Zhaorong is really mad.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Huiniang...
Is this the token you used to seduce my Peilang?
I'll destroy it.
And let your homeless spirit wander around finally turning into ashes
No!
Peilang!
Do you love Huiniang... or Zhaorong?
I...
Of course I love you, Zhaorong.
If so, destroy the token to prove your love.
But this is the only thing Huiniang...
...left behind.
I can't afford to be so heartless as to destroy it.
Huiniang is like a plum blossom.
Zhaorong is like a peach blossom.
It'll be ruthless to choose...
...from either of them.
I love Zhaorong.
But I also love Huiniang.
I...
We've done it.
Done What?
You know what it is!
Nan?
...
He's alright.
He's a nice guy.
Your response to my having waited for three painful years is a mere "What a dilemma!"
Peilang!
You've broken my heart into pieces.
Alright, I'll help to fulfill the two of you.
Huiniang, this body of mine take it!
Bao!
What are you doing here?
Congratulations!
For what?
I wasn't the lead of the play.
I sincerely believe that one day you'll be the lead.
Huixiang...
Easy.
No one saw me.
How is Mom?
I've asked Mrs Li to take care of her.
Go home.
I'll do that after your final performance.
Bao got stage fright at the last performance!
She's not feeling well.
I'll go see her.
Are you alright?
When did you come?
It's been a while.
Are you thinking of replacing Bao?
Can I?
It takes years of hard work...
...to be able to perform.
Good acting can't be achieved...
...by merely watching.
Bao suggested me to replace her.
Why would a lady come here at this late hour?
Why would the scholar return to this place?
Greetings, my lady.
Greetings, Scholar.
Where did I meet you before?
May I know your...
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown make you think of someone?
Oh, I remember.
The lady on the bridge also wore such red gown.
Would you know the whereabouts of that lady?
She's... ."dead.
Dead?
Her coffin is inside this mansion.
How did she die?
She's disillusioned and there was an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
What actually happened?
The Prime Minister learned about...
...Huiniang's affair with you and beat her to death.
Poor Huiniang, she was calling your name before she died.
Huiniang!
This is the token she'd left you.
The token reminds me of her.
Love is ruthless.
My tears dropping on this handkerchief...
When will I reunion with my beloved?
Bao.
You were great.
Just listen to the applause!
Keep up the good work.
Thank you.
I'll change first.
I'm fine, Hai.
I'll go first.
How can you manage to perform in this state?
Let me replace you.
No.
You don't know any of the craft.
Can you afford to see yourself...
...replaced by others?
Why didn't you have more rest?
Where's Huixiang?
She left.
Why didn't you tell me about the swap?
Was she good?
How could she?
She's totally green.
She suggested to replace me herself.
It's just one last show anyway.
You should sleep more.
I have to go to the party later.
I'll go, too.
I almost didn't recognize you on the stage.
It's almost like you're reincarnated.
But I must point out a few mistakes.
Near the end of Act One, you almost tripped me.
Sorry for that.
I'll do better next time.
I'll go get a drink.
Why did you lie to me?
I didn't.
Those applauses were fake.
Why did they have to act...
...after the play was over?
What are you angry at?
She did you a favour, didn't she?
What's the point of all this?
Stop the car!
Stop!
I went to watch the second half of the play.
Huixiang was indeed better than me.
She's just an amateur.
Really?
You do think so?
You are lying.
If you are so pressured... you might as well quit.
You've wanted to say so for a long time.
I'll quit, then.
I like the smell of your body.
If I'm gone, what'd you do?
Why will you be gone?
A one and a two...
A one and a two...
How I wish there's only one me in this world.
Miss, any particular style you'd want?
Let me have a look at this.
Huixiang.
Come and help me pick.
Why the necklace?
Someone wants to make up for his mistakes.
I'll take this.
Are you sure you can't make it?
I'm sorry...
Don't you wanna see me?
I shouldn't come...
Where are you?
If you don't wanna see me...
I'll vanish.
You'll never see me again.
Drinking by yourself?
Why?
I'm by myself, that's why.
Don't drink too much.
I'll get changed.
What?
Dance with me.
Let's get married.
Why?
It's time we settle down.
We can settle down by getting married?
Have you made your choice?
What's that?
Let's talk at the back of the hill.
Huixiang?
Are you back?
Is it raining outside?
Huixiang, is it raining outside?
Did you get soaked?
I'm fine.
Mom.
Go to sleep.
Hello?
Where have you been?
I couldn't reach your mobile.
Have you forgotten the signing of the contract?
I'll come right now.
Huixiang...
Huixiang...
Are you back?
Have you forgotten your keys?
Mrs Lin, it's me.
I've come to bring you to dinner at our place.
See, she is like last time again.
Gone without leaving a single word...
Huixiang called me.
She said she was going away for...
...a few days for some business.
I'll take care of you.
Sorry to trouble you again, Mrs Li.
No problem, just adding an extra pair of chopsticks.
Did Huixiang tell you where she went?
No.
She didn't mention.
Here's Mrs Li.
She didn't even bring her mobile phone.
She's been away for five days.
Didn't even give me one call.
Will there be an accident?
No.
Did she mention where she was going?
No.
She just said she'd be away for a couple of days.
Shall we call the police?
Call the police?
It's not necessary.
Last time we were on tour she followed the troupe for almost a month.
She's most probably just out...
...on a trip by herself.
Let's wait for a few more days.
I agree.
Huixiang called me herself.
What's wrong, Mom?
Mom!
Come and stay with us for a couple of days.
Huixiang may return in a couple of days.
I don't want to trouble you.
Bao.
Why don't you come to stay with me?
Is that okay for you?
Didn't Bao say so?
Huixiang always disappeared...
...like that without a word.
I know.
This time I just felt... a bit weird.
The night Huixiang disappeared,
Bao didn't go home either.
The day after that I saw her...
I have a hunch...
Her forehead had a bruise.
Bao may have something to do...
...with Huixiang's disappearance.
Don't worry.
I'm free in the next few days.
I'll help you to find her.
Waiter!
Coming.
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Nan!
Nan!
Do you have something to tell me?
Is it possible that Huixiang has amnesia?
Finished.
Don't break it up.
Let me take a couple of more photos.
That was quite difficult.
It can't be amnesia.
She had called Mrs Li.
Why did you choose an all-white jigsaw?
You're awesome!
What's all this photographing?
Did you find anything?
This is Weird.
You said Huixiang called Mrs Li?
Then she should be fine.
I can only hope so.
But...
What?
Nan also mentioned that...
Huixiang had impersonated Bao once in Beijing and replaced Bao in a performance.
She was brilliant, too.
Bao was very upset by that.
I have the full picture now!
It's all jealousy!
Women's jealousy.
Jealousy...
It's terrible!
Jealousy kills, don't you know that?
It's very late now.
Do you know Huixiang's whereabouts?
How do I know?
You're right.
How would you know.
You miss her?
She's your sister.
Of course I do.
She's my sister, that's why you miss her.
I miss her, too.
Did you notice?
Every time we came home,
Huixiang wore this red dress.
Take a look.
Have you had enough?
This is funny?
She was very unstable in every performance.
And the blocking was always wrong.
But there's no denial that...
...Bao's getting better and better.
Well, I don't think so.
On the contrary, I think she's a bad influence to the troupe.
You're too far-fetched.
No matter what, replace her.
Otherwise...
I'll quit.
Amy...
Let me!
Amy!
Li Huiniang, what's my crime?
Jia Sidao!
As Prime Minister, you have failed your country.
You're obsessed with your wives and concubines.
War is imminent, yet you're not taking any action.
Li Huiniang!
You're insolent!
How dare you insult me?
I'll sentence you to death!
My Lord, be merciful!
Sis...
Amy!
Amy!
Amy...
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Quick, move away!
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Hurry!
Amy!
How is that?
Why are you always so unfocused?
The doctor said it'll at least...
...take a week for her to recover.
Lucky that there's no concussion.
We're running out of time.
What should we do?
She's been following...
...the production for a long time.
Maybe we can let her try.
You did it on purpose today.
What do you mean?
Are you really that eager to perform?
So much so that you'll do whatever you will?
You can say whatever you want.
Zhong!
Come, quick!
Something is floating there.
Looks like a body!
Mrs Lin!
Is Mrs Lin home?
Mrs Lin is home.
Who's that?
It's Zhong from the police station.
What's the matter?
Uncle Tai just found...
...an overcoat on the seaside.
I'd like you to take a look to see...
...if it's yours.
Why is it wet?
It was floating on the sea.
Does this belong to any member of your family?
No... this isn't Huixiang's.
I've heard Huixiang is not home...
...these past two days.
She had something to take care of.
That'll be fine.
If something happens, do call the police.
We'll deal with it immediately.
I know.
But since Huixiang's family didn't report the case we're not entitled to do anything.
I understand.
I passed by Huixiang's shop everyday.
It's almost a week that it's been closed.
Isn't there an Uncle Tai...
...who's very close with her?
Huixiang always chatted with him at the pier.
He should be having his break...
...at the tea restaurant now.
It's his habit.
Never miss a single day.
Old chaps are like that.
Did her sister ask you to look for her?
No, it's Nan.
He was here this morning.
Oh?
He asked me for the overcoat.
It's the one Uncle Tai...
...found on the seaside two days ago.
They thought it was Huixiang's.
We brought it to Huixiang's Mom.
But she denied it was hers.
She's very angry.
Isn't that her mom...
I know there is something wrong with her eyes.
But Nan also said the same when he saw it this morning.
That proved her Mom was correct.
Uncle Tai?
My name is Wang.
I saw you get off the boat.
You have good eyes.
This is my name card.
I heard you found an overcoat on the seaside.
Yes.
Why are you interested in it?
Nan is my good friend.
I'm tracing something for him.
I know Nan.
I told the police about the overcoat.
Nobody cared.
Does it look familiar?
Who have you seen wearing it.
Honestly, I'm not sure.
But it's not Huixiang's style.
This I'm pretty sure.
But it does look a bit familiar.
Mr.
How are you?
What?
Can I ask something?
Anything strange happened here?
I saw Huixiang going to the pier hurriedly on that morning.
Are you sure it was Huixiang?
I recognized Huixiang's clothes.
Boss.
Is it usually so quiet?
Boss?
It's particularly quiet lately.
Why?
It's that old theatre over there...
It's haunted.
You're quick.
You were just inside a second ago.
Everything reminds me of her.
I dreamt that she talked to me.
Huiniang!
The handkerchief...
It was a token of love.
Is it because I look like her that you...
It was my mistake to have loved you.
Peilang!
What's the difference...
...between you and Jia Sidao?
Great!
That's the way it is!
We'll continue tomorrow.
I was rehearsing.
Huixiang?
I'm Bao.
Sorry.
I'm wrong again, Bao.
I'll change first.
Excuse me.
I can't locate the cloth Zhaorong wears at the climactic scene.
Sorry... guess we'll fix another time.
Let me find again.
I'll call you for another appointment.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
You called her Huixiang deliberately, right?
Yup.
You really want to look for clues here?
You think it may upset the people here?
No one in the troupe knows she has a twin sister.
Best avoid that.
I see.
Nan have you found out that the overcoat the police discovered was Bao's?
Why didn't you tell me?
Me and Huixiang...
I see.
Are you suspecting the same?
I can't believe Huixiang could have killed Bao.
You said you saw Bao holding Huixiang's hairpin?
I know now!
The one you saw isn't Bao.
She's Huixiang.
Huixiang was passing herself off as Bao.
I had thought so, too.
But...
There's something weird.
Nan got confused, too.
He can't differentiate...
...between Huixiang and Bao.
If Huixiang really passes herself off as Bao he should have recognized.
After all, they've been together for some time.
Have a DNA examination!
Just a few thousand bucks.
So simple.
DNA of twins are identical.
It doesn't work.
This leaves only the fingerprints.
Do it, then.
It's not easy.
We need to have the fingerprints...
...of both persons for comparison.
It'll end up to nothing.
Are we stuck?
I've got it!
It's time for my entrance.
Brother Nan.
What are you doing here?
It's about Huixiang's disappearance.
My brother seems to be totally clueless.
That's why I'm here to check and see.
Nan, have you made sure yourself whether it's Huixiang or Bao that we're seeing?
I'm going to the back of the hill.
The back of the hill?
Why?
I'll go with you.
Fingerprints...
If we have some objects with Bao's fingerprints to to compare with those of her right now... we can easily find out the truth.
Right?
She had stayed in my house, too.
The fingerprints of both...
...must have mixed together.
It's very difficult to verify.
Is there some place she'd have gone only...
...by herself?
Let me think.
I will, too.
I'd like to stay a bit longer.
Can you go down by yourself?
Sure.
Why would the scholar on the bridge return to this place?
Maybe it's harmless to meet him.
Greetings, Scholar.
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown remind you of someone?
She's... dead.
She's disillusioned and...
...this caused an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
Please come in.
I'll be ready in a minute.
This is for you.
Put it on and see if it fits.
I've missed you.
If there was no Bao will you be with me?
...Nan told me about...
...the disappearance of Huixiang.
I'm here to gather some clues.
It's very quiet here.
Very quiet, indeed.
At times it makes you feel scary.
It's disturbing.
Fan...
Do you know why I didn't report to the police about Huixiang after all these days?
Why?
I think it's Bao, and not Huixiang, who's staying with me now.
They have different scent.
But...
I must say I'm not at all sure.
Because at time I smelled Huixiang...
Seems like she's nearby.
It may sound absurd.
Before I lost my sight I couldn't differentiate between them.
They liked to swap cloths to fool me...
...when they were young.
It was at those times that...
...I was completely confused about the two... of them.
Luckily I was able to...
...finish Zhaorong's dress in time.
I lost the original.
The director was mad at me.
Just be more careful.
Lots of unfortunate things have happened.
Huixiang has...
Watch out.
There was Uncle Song...
...who died inside the seaside motel.
The body was discovered only...
...after more than ten days.
Poor chap!
More than ten days!
With this weather, the smell must be awful!
True.
We dare not walk near the place.
A haunted house no one dares go near...
Why is there light?
Fan...
I have the whole picture now.
What do you mean?
Didn't you say when you...
...were at the troupe earlier... someone told you that Bao...
...was seen in the props room but was spotted at the gate...
...in the next brink?
So what?
I'll have to go to the island for more clues.
Hey!
What?
Don't go alone.
There's nothing I can do...
...if something happens to you.
Stop Worrying.
I'm not a kid any more.
Hey...
What again?
The report on the fingerprints has been issued.
What does it say?
There were two sets of fingerprints...
...on the hairpin.
One of them was identical with...
...that on the tape recorder.
The hairpin belongs to Huixiang.
That means...
Yup.
That proves my assumption.
Eat something.
What happened the other night?
I'm asking you!
What the hell happened?
Let go to the back of the hill and talk.
You and Nan... ls there something going on...
...that I'm not aware of?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
Stop asking.
Let's find a shelter.
It's alright.
The thunder will pass.
Huixiang...
Why do you have to do this to me?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
As long as you believe...
...isn't that good enough?
Let's concentrate on tonight's performance...
...first.
Okay?
Fan...
What happened?
How did you find out I'm here?
You texted me.
Not me.
It must be Huixiang.
Huixiang?
She tied me up here.
Where's she?
Dunno.
She said something like...
Bao is the female lead for...
...the first time tonight.
Female lead?
I'm Nan, please leave a message.
Shit!
I hope I didn't regain consciousness.
Why?
Thank God you're still alive.
Otherwise, Bao and all of us will be heart-broken.
Bao is the lead for the first time...
...in tonight's show.
The mountain is bidding farewell to the sun.
The moon's reflection is bathing in the lake.
The breeze is stirring up my sadness.
Separated from the outside world...
I was held captive in desertion.
I was suffering great pain...
Even in my dreams I found myself...
...trapped in a dead-end.
Nan found Bao's hairpin in the hills.
This proves that they were there.
But how come they were out on the sea?
Did Huixiang mention this to you?
Yes.
Do you remember our childhood days when Jun and all of us went sailing on a stolen boat?
How I've missed those simple days.
I recall the time...
...when I almost fell into the sea.
It was you who saved me.
Is that so?
I have forgotten.
Huixiang...
Let's steal a boat and go sailing.
Honestly, you and Nan...
Look!
What a lovely sky!
Look at it!
It's so beautiful.
No.
I won't.
Huixiang!
I must make sure what's going on among us.
Bao, there are certain things that should remain unscathed.
No.
No.
I must make sure of them.
If that's the case, things will come to an end.
I don't care.
Even if the result is disastrous, I have to do that.
Do you know what he likes best?
Do you know where his erogenous zones lie?
Pervert!
If you don't know, what exactly do you want to make sure?
I know!
I know!
Why is he Nan?
Why?
There's one more thing you should know, too.
That is, you're a rotten actor.
And a rotten girlfriend, too.
Bullshit!
It's bullshit!
Bao...!
Huixiang...
Save me, Huixiang...
Bao!
Come, come!
You wanna drown me?
You want me dead!
You are sick!
Bao!
Bao!
Bao!
Did Huixiang explain why she didn't go home?
She remained unconscious...
...in the sea for a while.
But she was choked and came back...
...to life by the water.
She held herself to the boat and made sure Bao went ashore before she swam back.
Bao's clothes were all soaked.
She changed in Huixiang's clothes and left.
The person whom Uncle Tai...
...saw the other morning was in fact Bao.
But things just happened...
...too suddenly and horribly.
According to Huixiang's personality... she'd be totally clueless in facing Bao.
That's why she was afraid to go home.
I see now.
She must have hidden inside the old theatre.
Didn't you mention that there were...
...signs of people staying there?
Right.
I bumped into her hiding place.
That's why she had to find another place.
Intermission for 5 minutes.
One thing keeps bugging me.
Why didn't Bao say anything...
...about what happened on that night?
Did she really think she had killed Huixiang?
It might have been like that...
She found out soon that...
...Huixiang was still alive.
Because Mrs Li from the next door...
...received a call from Huixiang.
Didn't Bao make that call?
I had thought so.
But it was actually Huixiang who called.
Do you mean she had known...
...that Huixiang was alive?
Exactly.
That's why she objected to calling the police.
She even went to Huixiang's hiding place.
Not so fast, bro.
But why did she hide the fact that Huixiang was alive?
Difficult to fathom.
Maybe it was deliberate.
She may want to know...
...what Huixiang really wants?
I yearned for you...
And had waited in vain...
The parting three years ago...
...languished in my memory.
There wasn't a single night...
...I didn't find myself in tears.
Peilang...
You're the cause for...
...all these unbearable torments!
I was on the battlefield for three years...
This token has stayed with me all the time.
I wonder if I could have persisted without it.
My dearest Huiniang!
How I have missed and longed for you!
No!
If I have returned to meet Zhaorong...
I shouldn't have indulged myself...
...in Huiniang's memory.
She's dead and that's that.
To do that is simply unfair to Zhaorong.
No.
I must not do that.
But Huiniang died because of me.
How could I be so heartless in forgetting her and destroying the token?
Huiniang my beloved!
How I've missed you!
Peilang, my Peilang!
I have waited three long hard years in vain!
Huiniang is the Woman who...
...has been occupying your thoughts!
If, indeed, that is the case...
Fine!
You'll have my blessing.
Despite the sadness caused by parting love will ultimately turns into dust.
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused her...
...to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Aren't you Huiniang?
Weren't you dead three years ago?
Peilang, Zhaorong has fallen to lovesickness.
I'm borrowing her body to reincarnate.
What?
Zhaorong's dead?
Zhaorong's dead.
I'm Huiniang.
Huilang?
Are you Huiniang?
So we finally meet!
Huiniang's been dead for three years.
How is it possible to have a reincarnation?
Moreover...
The maid has just asked her to come forward.
Is she indeed Zhaorong instead?
Zhaorong?
Is that you, Zhaorong?
Am I Zhaorong?
How could this be?
Why did I call myself Huiniang?
Has the fortune-teller predicted correctly?
Huiniang's ghost is returning to take away Peilang from me?
Has Zhaorong lost her mind from lovesickness?
What has happened?
Zhaorong has indeed gone mad.
She thinks she's Huiniang herself but morphs into Zhaorong's identity again.
Zhaorong!
Please help unite us together.
Fulfill my wish.
Let me live with him happily ever after.
Will you?
What...
But Why?
Don't you realize?
You're dead in his mind.
You shouldn't have returned to badger things.
Huiniang's dead.
The one you saw was just an illusion.
Let me ask you one thing.
Do you want her, or me?
I...
I love Zhaorong...
Yet I love Huiniang, too.
Stop making a victim of yourself.
I've had enough.
Aren't you dead?
Why did you return?
From the very beginning, this stage should have been my stage.
From the very beginning, there's no place for you..
You really hated me that much?
I hated you to death!
Everything's fine without you.
Why do you have to return?
Why?
Indeed...
Why did I return?
It's because I cannot afford to miss you.
Huixiang!
Please step outside.
Don't disturb us.
Go away!
Curtains!
Quick!
What are you looking at!
Call the ambulance!
Huixiang...
We're too late!
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET
Yup.
Bao is coming back for dinner tonight.
Is her hubby coming with her?
Hubby?
They aren't married yet.
Your younger sister should get married.
They've been going out for a long time.
Nan is a nice guy.
Quite a talent in drama, too.
Uncle Tai, you didn't know his mother...
...was a very popular...
Cantonese opera actress?
Of course I didn't know
We mostly did old tunes.
Like this one...
It's silent in the garden at midnight...
The night is tender and charming...
Being in the countryside of Moscow.
Blessed is the lady who will be his wife..
Can you fish in this low tide?
There're only stones!
Not a chance.
I'll leave it to fate.
If the fish is willing, we'll be very happy.
I'm just doing this to kill time.
Your sister and Nan are made for each other.
They both studied theatre.
Met each other immediately after graduation.
You're right.
Bao is really lucky.
Sister Huiniang!
You mustn't be so obstinate...
A girl without true love cannot live long...
But being killed ruthlessly is...
...too much of a tragedy.
Huiniang, life is nothing but an illusion.
Please stay put for a while.
You must understand this is...
...the fate of us concubines.
Sister Huiniang!
Are you alright, Nan?
Nothing.
Am)'
Honestly,
I was thinking of... casting two actresses to play the roles.
The pressure would have been too heavy for one actress plus the two characters have to appear in the same scene.
However, I think whoever is being casted... the two roles must be played by the same actress.
Pei falls for Zhaorong... because she looks exactly like Huiniang.
If the two roles were played...
...by two different actresses... you won't get the same impact.
Bao!
DO YOU agree?
Yes, you're right, of course.
No question about it.
Nonetheless my performance has to be matched by others'.
Your lines were all wrong.
There's no rhythm and emotion at all.
Jiangxian should be sympathetic with Huiniang.
You'll ruin the performance of your partners.
I'd say, as Director, shouldn't you... consider casting another actress for Bao's role?
It's still early.
We have time to adjust that.
Bao, you must work harder.
You must listen to Amy's opinions.
I'm glad that everyone thinks...
...this is a good script.
Don't waste this opportunity.
Try your best.
Thanks, Director.
Thanks, Ms. Amy.
I'll work harder.
Daydreaming again?
Are we going to dry read?
Easy!
Stop thinking about rehearsals!
What else should I think about?
Me!
For me?
Have you forgotten?
It's your birthday!
It's unimaginable for such...
...a small potato like me to be with you.
I'd say...
You are the best birthday present...
...from God to me.
I've got a flu.
You'll get infected.
Try this, Bao.
Do you find your sister's cookery...
...a bit too light?
Light?
Let me.
Not at all.
She makes the best food.
Agreed?
Absolutely.
You simply won't find such...
...tasty spicy cuttlefish anywhere.
You may come more often and eat with us.
No way.
The chili's bad for him.
As you can see, he's still coughing.
Bao knows Nan best.
These dishes are made for you at Mom's request.
Bao, aren't these your favourite dishes?
See, everyone tries to please you.
No way.
You're all poking fun at me.
Poking fun at you?
Put on the scarf.
It's a bit chilly here.
You have to protect your throat well.
Huixiang, aren't you bored by facing... all this darkness everyday?
No.
Look, there are ships passing, and they've got lights.
Nonetheless, at times...
I find it scary.
I just feel like... being sucked by all this darkness.
As if nothing has ever existed.
Just kidding!
Nan said he'd like to take a walk.
At this hour?
It's kind of late.
It's the cat!
Don't be afraid.
I told you I didn't want to come.
I don't care about your crickets.
Do you wanna stay at home with your mom?
Stop bentering with each other.
You should know very well that Bao's biggest fear... is darkness.
Please, no rats.
Am I such a coward?
Really?
See who'll get the crickets first?
Where are you going?
A rat!
Look at yourself!
You were laughing at Bao.
Happy birthday.
It comes in a pair.
I bought it for the two of you.
You bought it primarily for her.
If that's what you think, you may throw it away.
It's too dark here.
Much darker than the stage.
I think the opposite.
The stage is often very bright.
So bright that you can never see the audience.
Yes.
This has an advantage.
At least you won't feel nervous.
It won't ruin your performance.
You don't have to care about...
...how others would look at you.
You seem to be freer on stage.
Won't mind how others think of you.
One can also choose one's favourite part... to play when one's on stage... and play it as one likes.
That'll be heaven.
You can't play the way you like on stage.
You have partners, and a director.
Not to mention the playwright.
It's not as simple as you'd think.
Right...
How's your play, The Legend of the Plum Blossom, going?
It's okay.
It's just...
Bao is in trouble.
The director is very demanding.
The female lead is fussy, too.
Can I go watch your rehearsals?
It's okay if the answer is no.
I don't mean that.
We're still at the beginning.
You may come later when we dress rehearse.
Did you find any cricket?
No.
Did you find any cricket?
Didn't see any.
I'll look further.
Let's go, too.
Have you waited for long?
Oh...
You left this in my house.
No wonder.
I've just made another copy.
You have an extra copy?
May I have this?
You like it?
It's yours.
I've read this script for many times.
I particularly like the part of Zhaorong.
I was thrilled by the suicide scene.
It's okay.
Bao likes it a lot, too.
KK
What are you doing here?
No need to work today?
I'm free.
I have an easy day.
Those guys thought they could...
...cheat the insurance company by hiding.
Where's your sister?
Shopping.
What else?
Wanna eat together?
Am I intruding?
Will you mind, Bao?
I'm Huixiang!
Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Haven't seen you for a while
Sorry.
The tour will start next month.
We must work harder.
Let's rehearse the last scene.
Starting from the sequence in which Zhaorong imagines herself as Huiniang and returns to meet Peilang.
Ready?
Okay.
Let's start.
Okay.
If you keep thinking of that girl so much...
I'll help you fulfill your wish.
Despite the sadness caused by parting, love will ultimately turns to dust Huiniang!
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused...
...her to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Are you Huiniang?
I thought you had died three years ago.
Peilang, it was Zhaorong who'd died from lovesick.
I'm using her body to return to life.
It's me!
I'm Huiniang.
Huiniang has been dead for three years.
It's not possible for her to resurrect to life.
Isn't her, in fact, Zhaorong?
Is it you, Zhaorong?
Why was it like that?
Why did I speak of myself as Huiniang?
Did the fortune-teller predict rightly?
Huiniang's spirit is taking over my body...
...to rob Peilang from me?
Huiniang!
You're too impudent!
How dare you exploiting my body to seduce my Peilang?
Huiniang?
Is that you, Huiniang?
Huiniang?
Am I Huiniang?
I'm Huiniang?
Look at this.
A token from her.
She's been dead for three years.
Zhaorong, look.
Peilang always carries this token with him.
This is a proof of his love for me.
I beg you.
Please give up your body and fulfill our wish.
Zhaorong is really mad.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Huiniang...
Is this the token you used to seduce my Peilang?
I'll destroy it.
And let your homeless spirit wander around finally turning into ashes
No!
Peﬂang!
Do you love Huiniang... or Zhaorong?
I...
Of course I love you, Zhaorong.
If so, destroy the token to prove your love.
But this is the only thing Huiniang...
...left behind.
I can't afford to be so heartless as to destroy it.
Huiniang is like a plum blossom.
Zhaorong is like a peach blossom.
It'll be ruthless to choose...
...from either of them.
I love Zhaorong.
But I also love Huiniang.
I...
We've done it.
Done What?
You know what it is!
Nan?
...
He's alright.
He's a nice guy.
Your response to my having waited for three painful years is a mere "What a dilemma!"
Peﬂang!
You've broken my heart into pieces.
Alright, I'll help to fulfill the two of you.
Huiniang, this body of mine take it!
Bao!
What are you doing here?
Congratulations!
For what?
I wasn't the lead of the play.
I sincerely believe that one day you'll be the lead.
Huixiang...
Easy.
No one saw me.
How is Mom?
I've asked Mrs Li to take care of her.
Go home.
I'll do that after your final performance.
Bao got stage fright at the last performance!
She's not feeling well.
I'll go see her.
Are you alright?
When did you come?
It's been a while.
Are you thinking of replacing Bao?
Can I?
It takes years of hard work...
...to be able to perform.
Good acting can't be achieved...
...by merely watching.
Bao suggested me to replace her.
Why would a lady come here at this late hour?
Why would the scholar return to this place?
Greetings, my lady.
Greetings, Scholar.
Where did I meet you before?
May I know your...
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown make you think of someone?
Oh, I remember.
The lady on the bridge also wore such red gown.
Would you know the whereabouts of that lady?
She's... ."dead.
Dead?
Her coffin is inside this mansion.
How did she die?
She's disillusioned and there was an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
What actually happened?
The Prime Minister learned about...
...Huiniang's affair with you and beat her to death.
Poor Huiniang, she was calling your name before she died.
Huiniang!
This is the token she'd left you.
The token reminds me of her.
Love is ruthless.
My tears dropping on this handkerchief...
When will I reunion with my beloved?
Bao.
You were great.
Just listen to the applause!
Keep up the good work.
Thank you.
I'll change first.
I'm fine, Hai.
I'll go first.
How can you manage to perform in this state?
Let me replace you.
No.
You don't know any of the craft.
Can you afford to see yourself...
...replaced by others?
Why didn't you have more rest?
Where's Huixiang?
Sheleﬂ.
Why didn't you tell me about the swap?
Was she good?
How could she?
She's totally green.
She suggested to replace me herself.
It's just one last show anyway.
You should sleep more.
I have to go to the party later.
I'll go, too.
I almost didn't recognize you on the stage.
It's almost like you're reincarnated.
But I must point out a few mistakes.
Near the end of Act One, you almost tripped me.
Sorry for that.
I'll do better next time.
I'll go get a drink.
Why did you lie to me?
I didn't.
Those applauses were fake.
Why did they have to act...
...after the play was over?
What are you angry at?
She did you a favour, didn't she?
What's the point of all this?
Stop the car!
Slop!
I went to watch the second half of the play.
Huixiang was indeed better than me.
She's just an amateur.
Really?
You do think so?
You are lying.
If you are so pressured... you might as well quit.
You've wanted to say so for a long time.
I'll quit, then.
I like the smell of your body.
If I'm gone, what'd you do?
Why will you be gone?
A one and a two...
A one and a two...
How I wish there's only one me in this world.
Miss, any particular style you'd want?
Let me have a look at this.
Huixiang.
Come and help me pick.
Why the necklace?
Someone wants to make up for his mistakes.
I'll take this.
Are you sure you can't make it?
I'm sorry...
Don't you wanna see me?
I shouldn't come...
Where are you?
If you don't wanna see me...
I'll vanish.
You'll never see me again.
Drinking by yourself?
Why?
I'm by myself, that's why.
Don't drink too much.
I'll get changed.
What?
Dance with me.
Let's get married.
Why?
It's time we settle down.
We can settle down by getting married?
Have you made your choice?
What's that?
Let's talk at the back of the hill.
Huixiang?
Are you back?
Is it raining outside?
Huixiang, is it raining outside?
Did you get soaked?
I'm fine.
Mom.
Go to sleep.
Hello?
Where have you been?
I couldn't reach your mobile.
Have you forgotten the signing of the contract?
I'll come right now.
Huixiang...
Huixiang...
Are you back?
Have you forgotten your keys?
Mrs Lin, it's me.
I've come to bring you to dinner at our place.
See, she is like last time again.
Gone without leaving a single word...
Huixiang called me.
She said she was going away for...
...a few days for some business.
I'll take care of you.
Sorry to trouble you again, Mrs Li.
No problem, just adding an extra pair of chopsticks.
Did Huixiang tell you where she went?
No.
She didn't mention.
Here's Mrs Li.
She didn't even bring her mobile phone.
She's been away for five days.
Didn't even give me one call.
Will there be an accident?
No.
Did she mention where she was going?
No.
She just said she'd be away for a couple of days.
Shall we call the police?
Call the police?
It's not necessary.
Last time we were on tour she followed the troupe for almost a month.
She's most probably just out...
...on a trip by herself.
Let's wait for a few more days.
I agree.
Huixiang called me herself.
What's wrong, Mom?
Mom!
Come and stay with us for a couple of days.
Huixiang may return in a couple of days.
I don't want to trouble you.
Bao.
Why don't you come to stay with me?
Is that okay for you?
Didn't Bao say so?
Huixiang always disappeared...
...like that without a word.
I know.
This time I just felt... a bit weird.
The night Huixiang disappeared,
Bao didn't go home either.
The day after that I saw her...
I have a hunch...
Her forehead had a bruise.
Bao may have something to do...
...with Huixiang's disappearance.
Don't worry.
I'm free in the next few days.
I'll help you to find her.
Waiter!
Coming.
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Nan!
Nan!
Do you have something to tell me?
Is it possible that Huixiang has amnesia?
Finished.
Don't break it up.
Let me take a couple of more photos.
That was quite difficult.
It can't be amnesia.
She had called Mrs Li.
Why did you choose an all-white jigsaw?
You're awesome!
What's all this photographing?
Did you find anything?
This is Weird.
You said Huixiang called Mrs Li?
Then she should be fine.
I can only hope so.
But...
What?
Nan also mentioned that...
Huixiang had impersonated Bao once in Beijing and replaced Bao in a performance.
She was brilliant, too.
Bao was very upset by that.
I have the full picture now!
It's all jealousy!
Women's jealousy.
Jealousy...
It's terrible!
Jealousy kills, don't you know that?
It's very late now.
Do you know Huixiang's whereabouts?
How do I know?
You're right.
How would you know.
You miss her?
She's your sister.
Of course I do.
She's my sister, that's why you miss her.
I miss her, too.
Did you notice?
Every time we came home,
Huixiang wore this red dress.
Take a look.
Have you had enough?
This is funny?
She was very unstable in every performance.
And the blocking was always wrong.
But there's no denial that...
...Bao's getting better and better.
Well, I don't think so.
On the contrary, I think she's a bad influence to the troupe.
You're too far-fetched.
No matter what, replace her.
Otherwise...
I'll quit.
Amy...
Let me!
Amy!
Li Huiniang, what's my crime?
Jia Sidao!
As Prime Minister, you have failed your country.
You're obsessed with your wives and concubines.
War is imminent, yet you're not taking any action.
Li Huiniang!
You're insolent!
How dare you insult me?
I'll sentence you to death!
My Lord, be merciful!
Sis...
Amy!
Amy!
Amy...
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Quick, move away!
Get the ambulance, hurry!
Hurry!
Amy!
How is that?
Why are you always so unfocused?
The doctor said it'll at least...
...take a week for her to recover.
Lucky that there's no concussion.
We're running out of time.
What should we do?
She's been following...
...the production for a long time.
Maybe we can let her try.
You did it on purpose today.
What do you mean?
Are you really that eager to perform?
So much so that you'll do whatever you will?
You can say whatever you want.
Zhong!
Come, quick!
Something is floating there.
Looks like a body!
Mrs Lin!
Is Mrs Lin home?
Mrs Lin is home.
Who's that?
It's Zhong from the police station.
What's the matter?
Uncle Tai just found...
...an overcoat on the seaside.
I'd like you to take a look to see...
...if it's yours.
Why is it wet?
It was floating on the sea.
Does this belong to any member of your family?
No... this isn't Huixiang's.
I've heard Huixiang is not home...
...these past two days.
She had something to take care of.
That'll be fine.
If something happens, do call the police.
We'll deal with it immediately.
I know.
But since Huixiang's family didn't report the case we're not entitled to do anything.
I understand.
I passed by Huixiang's shop everyday.
It's almost a week that it's been closed.
Isn't there an Uncle Tai...
...who's very close with her?
Huixiang always chatted with him at the pier.
He should be having his break...
...at the tea restaurant now.
It's his habit.
Never miss a single day.
Old chaps are like that.
Did her sister ask you to look for her?
No, it's Nan.
He was here this morning.
Oh?
He asked me for the overcoat.
It's the one Uncle Tai...
...found on the seaside two days ago.
They thought it was Huixiang's.
We brought it to Huixiang's Mom.
But she denied it was hers.
She's very angry.
Isn't that her mom...
I know there is something wrong with her eyes.
But Nan also said the same when he saw it this morning.
That proved her Mom was correct.
Uncle Tai?
My name is Wang.
I saw you get off the boat.
You have good eyes.
This is my name card.
I heard you found an overcoat on the seaside.
Yes.
Why are you interested in it?
Nan is my good friend.
I'm tracing something for him.
I know Nan.
I told the police about the overcoat.
Nobody cared.
Does it look familiar?
Who have you seen wearing it.
Honestly, I'm not sure.
But it's not Huixiang's style.
This I'm pretty sure.
But it does look a bit familiar.
Mr.
How are you?
What?
Can I ask something?
Anything strange happened here?
I saw Huixiang going to the pier hurriedly on that morning.
Are you sure it was Huixiang?
I recognized Huixiang's clothes.
Boss.
Is it usually so quiet?
Boss?
It's particularly quiet lately.
Why?
It's that old theatre over there...
It's haunted.
You're quick.
You were just inside a second ago.
Everything reminds me of her.
I dreamt that she talked to me.
Huiniang!
The handkerchief...
It was a token of love.
Is it because I look like her that you...
It was my mistake to have loved you.
Peﬂang!
What's the difference...
...between you and Jia Sidao?
Great!
That's the way it is!
We'll continue tomorrow.
I was rehearsing.
Huixiang?
I'm Bao.
Sorry.
I'm wrong again, Bao.
I'll change first.
Excuse me.
I can't locate the cloth Zhaorong wears at the climactic scene.
Sorry... guess we'll fix another time.
Let me find again.
I'll call you for another appointment.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
You called her Huixiang deliberately, right?
Yup.
You really want to look for clues here?
You think it may upset the people here?
No one in the troupe knows she has a twin sister.
Best avoid that.
I see.
Nan have you found out that the overcoat the police discovered was Bao's?
Why didn't you tell me?
Me and Huixiang...
I see.
Are you suspecting the same?
I can't believe Huixiang could have killed Bao.
You said you saw Bao holding Huixiang's hairpin?
I know now!
The one you saw isn't Bao.
She's Huixiang.
Huixiang was passing herself off as Bao.
I had thought so, too.
But...
There's something weird.
Nan got confused, too.
He can't differentiate...
...between Huixiang and Bao.
If Huixiang really passes herself off as Bao he should have recognized.
After all, they've been together for some time.
Have a DNA examination!
Just a few thousand bucks.
So simple.
DNA of twins are identical.
It doesn't work.
This leaves only the fingerprints.
Do it, then.
It's not easy.
We need to have the fingerprints...
...of both persons for comparison.
It'll end up to nothing.
Are we stuck?
I've got it!
It's time for my entrance.
Brother Nan.
What are you doing here?
It's about Huixiang's disappearance.
My brother seems to be totally clueless.
That's why I'm here to check and see.
Nan, have you made sure yourself whether it's Huixiang or Bao that we're seeing?
I'm going to the back of the hill.
The back of the hill?
Why?
I'll go with you.
Fingerprints...
If we have some objects with Bao's fingerprints to to compare with those of her right now... we can easily find out the truth.
Right?
She had stayed in my house, too.
The fingerprints of both...
...must have mixed together.
It's very difficult to verify.
Is there some place she'd have gone only...
...by herself?
Let me think.
I will, too.
I'd like to stay a bit longer.
Can you go down by yourself?
Sure.
Why would the scholar on the bridge return to this place?
Maybe it's harmless to meet him.
Greetings, Scholar.
You only care about Huiniang.
Scholar, doesn't this red gown remind you of someone?
She's... dead.
She's disillusioned and...
...this caused an accident.
She visited the lake but met her death instead.
Please come in.
I'll be ready in a minute.
This is for you.
Put it on and see if it fits.
I've missed you.
If there was no Bao will you be with me?
...Nan told me about...
...the disappearance of Huixiang.
I'm here to gather some clues.
It's very quiet here.
Very quiet, indeed.
At times it makes you feel scary.
It's disturbing.
Fan...
Do you know why I didn't report to the police about Huixiang after all these days?
Why?
I think it's Bao, and not Huixiang, who's staying with me now.
They have different scent.
But...
I must say I'm not at all sure.
Because at time I smelled Huixiang...
Seems like she's nearby.
It may sound absurd.
Before I lost my sight I couldn't differentiate between them.
They liked to swap cloths to fool me...
...when they were young.
It was at those times that...
...I was completely confused about the two... of them.
Luckily I was able to...
...finish Zhaorong's dress in time.
I lost the original.
The director was mad at me.
Just be more careful.
Lots of unfortunate things have happened.
Huixiang has...
Watch out.
There was Uncle Song...
...who died inside the seaside motel.
The body was discovered only...
...after more than ten days.
Poor chap!
More than ten days!
With this weather, the smell must be awful!
True.
We dare not walk near the place.
A haunted house no one dares go near...
Why is there light?
Fan...
I have the whole picture now.
What do you mean?
Didn't you say when you...
...were at the troupe earlier... someone told you that Bao...
...was seen in the props room but was spotted at the gate...
...in the next brink?
So what?
I'll have to go to the island for more clues.
Hey!
What?
Don't go alone.
There's nothing I can do...
...if something happens to you.
Stop Worrying.
I'm not a kid any more.
Hey...
What again?
The report on the fingerprints has been issued.
What does it say?
There were two sets of fingerprints...
...on the hairpin.
One of them was identical with...
...that on the tape recorder.
The hairpin belongs to Huixiang.
That means...
Yup.
That proves my assumption.
Eat something.
What happened the other night?
I'm asking you!
What the hell happened?
Let go to the back of the hill and talk.
You and Nan... ls there something going on...
...that I'm not aware of?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
Stop asking.
Let's find a shelter.
It's alright.
The thunder will pass.
Huixiang...
Why do you have to do this to me?
There are things that should remain unsaid.
As long as you believe...
...isn't that good enough?
Let's concentrate on tonight's performance...
...first.
Okay?
Fan...
What happened?
How did you find out I'm here?
You texted me.
Not me.
It must be Huixiang.
Huixiang?
She tied me up here.
Where's she?
Dunno.
She said something like...
Bao is the female lead for...
...the first time tonight.
Female lead?
I'm Nan, please leave a message.
Shit!
I hope I didn't regain consciousness.
Why?
Thank God you're still alive.
Otherwise, Bao and all of us will be heart-broken.
Bao is the lead for the first time...
...in tonight's show.
The mountain is bidding farewell to the sun.
The moon's reflection is bathing in the lake.
The breeze is stirring up my sadness.
Separated from the outside world...
I was held captive in desertion.
I was suffering great pain...
Even in my dreams I found myself...
...trapped in a dead-end.
Nan found Bao's hairpin in the hills.
This proves that they were there.
But how come they were out on the sea?
Did Huixiang mention this to you?
Yes.
Do you remember our childhood days when Jun and all of us went sailing on a stolen boat?
How I've missed those simple days.
I recall the time...
...when I almost fell into the sea.
It was you who saved me.
Is that so?
I have forgotten.
Huixiang...
Let's steal a boat and go sailing.
Honestly, you and Nan...
Look!
What a lovely sky!
Look at it!
It's so beautiful.
No.
I won't.
Huixiang!
I must make sure what's going on among us.
Bao, there are certain things that should remain unscathed.
No.
No.
I must make sure of them.
If that's the case, things will come to an end.
I don't care.
Even if the result is disastrous, I have to do that.
Do you know what he likes best?
Do you know where his erogenous zones lie?
Pervert!
If you don't know, what exactly do you want to make sure?
I know!
I know!
Why is he Nan?
Why?
There's one more thing you should know, too.
That is, you're a rotten actor.
And a rotten girlfriend, too.
Bullshit!
It's bullshit!
Bao...!
Huixiang...
Save me, Huixiang...
Bao!
Come, come!
You wanna drown me?
You want me dead!
You are sick!
Bao!
Bao!
Bao!
Did Huixiang explain why she didn't go home?
She remained unconscious...
...in the sea for a while.
But she was choked and came back...
...to life by the water.
She held herself to the boat and made sure Bao went ashore before she swam back.
Bao's clothes were all soaked.
She changed in Huixiang's clothes and left.
The person whom Uncle Tai...
...saw the other morning was in fact Bao.
But things just happened...
...too suddenly and horribly.
According to Huixiang's personality... she'd be totally clueless in facing Bao.
That's why she was afraid to go home.
I see now.
She must have hidden inside the old theatre.
Didn't you mention that there were...
...signs of people staying there?
Right.
I bumped into her hiding place.
That's why she had to find another place.
Intermission for 5 minutes.
One thing keeps bugging me.
Why didn't Bao say anything...
...about what happened on that night?
Did she really think she had killed Huixiang?
It might have been like that...
She found out soon that...
...Huixiang was still alive.
Because Mrs Li from the next door...
...received a call from Huixiang.
Didn't Bao make that call?
I had thought so.
But it was actually Huixiang who called.
Do you mean she had known...
...that Huixiang was alive?
Exactly.
That's why she objected to calling the police.
She even went to Huixiang's hiding place.
Not so fast, bro.
But why did she hide the fact that Huixiang was alive?
Difficult to fathom.
Maybe it was deliberate.
She may want to know...
...what Huixiang really wants?
I yearned for you...
And had waited in vain...
The parting three years ago...
...languished in my memory.
There wasn't a single night...
...I didn't find myself in tears.
Peilang...
You're the cause for...
...all these unbearable torments!
I was on the battlefield for three years...
This token has stayed with me all the time.
I wonder if I could have persisted without it.
My dearest Huiniang!
How I have missed and longed for you!
No!
If I have returned to meet Zhaorong...
I shouldn't have indulged myself...
...in Huiniang's memory.
She's dead and that's that.
To do that is simply unfair to Zhaorong.
No.
I must not do that.
But Huiniang died because of me.
How could I be so heartless in forgetting her and destroying the token?
Huiniang my beloved!
How I've missed you!
Peilang, my Peilang!
I have waited three long hard years in vain!
Huiniang is the Woman who...
...has been occupying your thoughts!
If, indeed, that is the case...
Fine!
You'll have my blessing.
Despite the sadness caused by parting love will ultimately turns into dust.
I'll never cease the yearning for my beloved.
Zhaorong's jealousy has caused her...
...to develop hallucinations.
She imagines herself as Huiniang...
...to satisfy Peilang's craving.
Aren't you Huiniang?
Weren't you dead three years ago?
Peilang, Zhaorong has fallen to lovesickness.
I'm borrowing her body to reincarnate.
What?
Zhaorong's dead?
Zhaorong's dead.
I'm Huiniang.
Huilang?
Are you Huiniang?
So we finally meet!
Huiniang's been dead for three years.
How is it possible to have a reincarnation?
Moreover...
The maid has just asked her to come forward.
Is she indeed Zhaorong instead?
Zhaorong?
Is that you, Zhaorong?
Am I Zhaorong?
How could this be?
Why did I call myself Huiniang?
Has the fortune-teller predicted correctly?
Huiniang's ghost is returning to take away Peilang from me?
Has Zhaorong lost her mind from lovesickness?
What has happened?
Zhaorong has indeed gone mad.
She thinks she's Huiniang herself but morphs into Zhaorong's identity again.
Zhaorong!
Please help unite us together.
Fulfill my wish.
Let me live with him happily ever after.
Will you?
What...
But Why?
Don't you realize?
You're dead in his mind.
You shouldn't have returned to badger things.
Huiniang's dead.
The one you saw was just an illusion.
Let me ask you one thing.
Do you want her, or me?
I...
I love Zhaorong...
Yet I love Huiniang, too.
Stop making a victim of yourself.
I've had enough.
Aren't you dead?
Why did you return?
From the very beginning, this stage should have been my stage.
From the very beginning, there's no place for you..
You really hated me that much?
I hated you to death!
Everything's fine without you.
Why do you have to return?
Why?
Indeed...
Why did I return?
It's because I cannot afford to miss you.
Huixiang!
Please step outside.
Don't disturb us.
Go away!
Curtains!
Quick!
What are you looking at!
Call the ambulance!
Huixiang...
We're too late!

Bitches like that.
Black Dynamite pimping ain't never been easy in these streets.
But now it's damn near imposable.
We are being pushed around by a bunch of outta control angry ninjas, that just ain't respecting the game Black Dynamite.
Hmm.
The police think that they can shoot a ninja in the back just because he's a ninja!
?
I say [Bleep] that!
I say ninja power!
This week..
Just beat it..
Or Jackson Five across your eyes.
Chauncey, how your baby mama doing?
Ninja, I ain't Chauncey.
Sorry my ninja, these damn masks man.
Honeybee, how's them explosive charges coming?
All set to blow Black Dynamite.
Good Corn we wired up yet?
No doubt, just about.
All right gang you've got until 3 Mississippi to split, if you want to keep your asses in tact.
Meet me at the getaway car just like we planned.
It's time to send Fiendish Doctor Wu a message.
All the ninjas in the world are no match for a couple of decent black folks working together with a plan.
And some explosives.
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

No way.
Mister Jackson says nobody goes back stage.
I'm sorry Michael.
- We all sorr..
- Shut your ass Joseph.
These mother [Bleepers] messed up on Soul Train.
On Soul Train.
Obviously whipping the living [Bleep] out of these boys twice a day ain't working out.
So we're gonna try something different.
Oh.
Thank God.
You're gonna beat they asses four times a day!
- Man!

I ain't no pedophile or nothing.
I just wanna see Mike Jack.
Don't be a [Bleep] Joe kill one of these kids with your belt.
No!
Please Michael!
It's the only way these mother [Bleepers] are gonna learn.

Michael Jackson is fine.
Thanks to you blocking that bullet with your ass.
Damn you all look [Bleeped] up.
That's because we were fighting Fiendish Doctor Wu and all his ninjas.
And you were supposed to be driving the damn getaway car.
Aw man, I forgot all about them ninjas Black Dynamite.
It's a good thing I didn't know Michael Jackson was gonna be on Soul Train.
Or I might not have showed up either.
All right look from now on nobody is allowed to run off to Soul Train, and take a bullet for a mother [Bleeper] with out,
Black Dynamite's prior express written consent.
Excuse me, may I come in?
Hi.
I'm Michael.
Oh my God that's Michael Jackson.
Of the Jackson 5.
Honeybee I know who Michael Jackson is and what he is of.
Michael.
Are you okay?
I'm fine thanks to you.
You saved my life.
I've got a friend called Corn.
Mike, that was so beautiful.
Like a little black angel.
Man Michael J. You put some ankles in his name.
Don't worry Michael Jackson I'm sure that once you grow some man balls you won't sound like a little girl no more.
Now Cream Corn these ninjas have gone crazy.
So we need to get back to work.
I'll be out in the car.
Now ninja tell me what Fiendish Doctor Wu is up to.
And what is his plan?
Wait, wait I'll tell you what he up to.
Why do I have to tell you his plan?
That's like the same thing, man you gotta get it together.
Can't you see Jive Turkey is just using you, in his outta bounds dream to achieve world wide domination?
.. But he's muscle sauce on my meat.
And you know he chose me outta everybody.
Nice little guy too.
Talking to me, gotta a lot a..
Cream Corn how many times have I told you not to interrupt my interrogation?
We need to stay focused on breaking this ninjas will.
There's a delivery for Cream Corn..
Ah!
Look what Michael Jackson sent for me!
A pimping silk cape covered with the Japanese symbol for bravery.
I've always wanted one of these.
Damn that [Bleep] is groovy.
You all really know Michael Jackson?
My ninja know Jermaine, but everybody know Jermaine.
Man it ain't even cold and Michael Jackson got it snowing in the globe.
Oh my God Michael!
What are you doing here?
I just couldn't stop thinking about that bullet that you caught in your ass for me.
That was so very very special.
So I thought it might be nice to make it Christmas in July for you.

It's like a dream.
Thank you Michael Jackson.
Thank you.

He-he-he.
That Michael Jackson is a stone cold pimp.
What's so stone cold about a little boy buying a mother [Bleeper] all the things he ever dreamed of?
I bet couldn't swing a Nunchuck if he tried.
Honey..

My Daddy tried to shoot me dead.
His cold steel was pointing at my head.
Then I found a love..
Michael Jackson will you stop the [Bleep] damn singing?
Shut the [Bleep] up and let a grown man find his grappling hook's..
Pleas don't hit me Black Dynamite.
I didn't mean to make you mad.
Trust me Michael Jackson.
If I was gonna hit you, you would a already been hit.
Cream Corn it's time for Michael Jackson to go.
Go?
But me and Michael Jackson are about to have a sleep over.
The Whorephanage is a place for whores and orphans.
Not Michael Jackson.
You know what?
I think you're just jealous Black Dynamite.
Jealous, of him?
Please any Solid Gold dancer could do that.
Now I'm not asking you Cream Corn I'm telling you..
Michael Jackson has got to go.
Here, how about I just buy your little Whorephanage?
Then we can have as many sleep overs as we want.
My business and these whores are not for sale.
Michael Jackson makes me happy Black Dynamite.
And if you don't want to see me happy maybe I should just go.
Cream Corn if you walk out that door, you might as well never come back.
Fine!
Ain't nothing here but a bunch of whores and orphans anyway.

[Bleep] Damn it I already told the second bitch "no".
I don't care about Black Dynamite.
Or that Whorephanage at all.
Yeah.
Be with me, and all your silly dreams will come true, I'll buy them all.
Because you're mine.
Because the gosh darn Corn is mine.
Every night you move up in my life.
I knew you were the one.
Got me a Japanese cape that says bravery.
With my name it's all **.
The Corn is Mike's.
The gosh darn Corn is Mike's.
Mike's..
Mike's..
Mike's..
That was beautiful.
But I would maybe hit that last note a little bit harder.
A little harder?
Hear that Quincy Jones?
Cream Corn thinks that I should hit that note a little harder.
How much harder Cream Corn?
Um you know..
I don't know..
Maybe just a little bit harder.
Just a little harder, not a lot harder?
How much that hit be Cream Corn?
- Should it be this hard?
- Oh!
I'm sorry Mike.
Maybe this hard?
How much should it be?
- I'm sorry man.
- You're sorry alright.
You the sorriest mother [Bleeper] in this mother [Bleeper].
Mother [Bleeper].
Don't you ever tell Michael Jackson how hard his hits should be.
You hear me?
Yes Michael!
Yes!
Cream Corn, now why did you have to go and make me do that to you?
I'm not mad at you.
But if you do it again...
I'm a kill you.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay Q. I wanna hurry up so Cream Corn and I can go get some ice cream.
Would you like that Cream Corn?
Some ice cream?
Uh..
Yup..
Ben?
Man Cream Corn is living in the lap of luxury.
That mother [Bleeper] Michael Jackson, must be all he's cracked up to be.
Oh!
[Bleep] Have you been hit?
What are you two doing here?
Cream Corn what happened to your face?
I am fine, Michael is just under a lot of pressure right now.
Michael did this to you?
Cream Corn I said it once and I'll say it again..
Little boys shouldn't be laying their hands on no grown ass men.
Oh you coming home with us now.
It will get better Michael's a genius.
You know how geniuses are.
Right?
Right?
You guys should go before Michael sees you.
Ninja now I'm only going to ask you this one more time.
- Tell me where..
- I don't know them ninjas man.
I said tell me where..
[Bleep] Dammit, who's interrupting my head-locking?
This better not have anything with Cream Corn or Michael Jackson.
We need to talk to you about Cream Corn and Michael Jackson.
Black Dynamite, please that Michael Jackson ain't who he appears to be.
Cream Corn may be in real trouble.
But there's only one way to know for sure.
And what's that?
You gotta go get the real dirt from his Daddy.
Daddy knows.
Fine.
Thank you ninja for that unsolicited advice.
And you riding bitch.
Black Dynamite, thank goodness you're here.
Michael Jackson ain't who he appears to be.
Your friend Cream Corn is in real trouble.
Told you.
Tell me more Joe Jackson and keep talking.
Well it all started in a tiny little house.
In a small town called Gary Indiana.
We was poor and life was [Bleep].
Ain't nothing to do in Gary but [Bleep] all day and hope you make a talented baby.
It seemed that every nine months, Katherine would pop put another little Jackson.
But each one was less talented than the last.
"Rebbie".
"Jackie".
"Tito".
Jermaine.
Shamon.
La Toya.
Marlon, talk about a [Bleep] damn loosing streak.
Until one night..
Huh?
What the he..
I was amazed at first.
But when I thought about it..
What ever it was that got her pregnant, just saved Joe Jackson two minutes of hard work.
The very next day my half alien son Michael Joseph Jackson was born.
I knew that baby wasn't mine.
Because the mother [Bleeper] had talent.
He-he-he.
Scary as the [Bleep] was the first time I saw it.
The mother [Bleeper] sang and danced.
And do 'em both really well.
Ho!
I needed a lead singer.
That's when I decided to raise it as my own son.
And the Jackson 5 was birthed.
I sent Tito to the joke shop to find an Afro Wig, and the widest toy nose he could find.
And I had Katherine blacken him up the best she could.
And the rest is music history.
I tried to keep this a secret for as long as I could.
But he's abusive Black Dynamite.
And every time me and the boys start [Bleeping] up.
He remind us of what happened to poor little Shamon.
Shamon..
Shamon..
Shamon..
Ya!
That's all I hear.
Man everything seems to be not what it is.
And what it is seems not to be.
My crew is in shambles and Cream Corn had been abducted by an alien.
And I don't even know if I can save him.
Or even if he wants me to.
You know man a ninja like me has got experience with this type of thing.
What you talking about ninja?
Ninjas do wrong to each other sometimes.
And in that way the force of the earth comes around the moon.
And at that presence, the dirt, It over shadows the grass.
And you like I can't cut this grass, there's no sun coming through.
So in order to enable each other the two fruits have to look each other in the eye, understand we can only be ripe as the ripe is wrong.
You know what I mean?
Man, I never thought I'd see the day when the only person talking any sense was a damn ninja.
Michael?
I think..
I think I wanna leave Neverland.
You wanna do what?
I wanna leave!
No.
You don't wanna leave.
You never wanna leave.
You want some fresh baked cookies is what you want.
Uh..
No?
But they smell so good!
- Oh [Bleep].
- What the hell!
?
Look Cream Corn there's something you need to know about Michael Jackson.
I'm an alien Cream Corn.
Well half.
Part human part MamaSe MamaSa MamaKossa.
MamaSe MamaSa MamaKossa?
That's right MamaSe MamaSa MamaKossa.
But what does that all mean?
What do you think it means?
We're aliens.
We're going to kill all the humans and take the planet.
But you don't have to worry about that Cream Corn.
You're my friend.
Whew!
Thank God.
I'm just going to impregnate you with thousands of and thousands of alien babies.
Do you have any stretch pants?
What!
?
Impregnate my ass!
Why you wanna be starting something Cream Corn?
No!
No!
Ah!
Ah!
Help!
Ah!
Help!
Um..
Oh..
No!
You can't leave Cream Corn.
Ah!

Speak to me.
Now..
We're even.
He-he..
That's some cold sentimental [Bleep] you just did Michael Jackson.
Cream Corn you're a good friend.
I'm so sorry for abusing and terrorizing you.
It's okay, you're still kind of worth it.
At least you didn't get me pregnant.
Now Michael Jackson you need to to choose whether you want to use your human side to save humanity or your alien side to destroy it.
You're right I think I finally learned my lesson Black Dynamite.
I'm changing my ways from this day on.
And a piece of advice if you're still going to live here amongst earth folk.
Go back to that cute black face, with that wide ass nose that America fell in love with.
You know this one right here.
Because you're real face kind of freaks me out.
Maybe change your features gradually over time.
You know, so people can get acclimated.
Good idea.
The other thing I would do is find a cause you're passionate about.
Like saving the whales, world peace, the children or..
That's it the children.
I'm going to spend all my time thinking about the children.
The children.
The children.
Thank you Black Dynamite.
Glad I could help Michael Jackson.
